Book 1,Preface,"Whether in tracing the history of the Roman people, from the foundationof the city, I shall employ myself to a useful purpose,[1] I am neithervery certain, nor, if I were, dare I say: inasmuch as I observe, that itis both an old and hackneyed practice,[2] later authors always supposingthat they will either adduce something more authentic in the facts, or,that they will excel the less polished ancients in their style ofwriting. Be that as it may, it will, at all events, be a satisfaction tome, that I too have contributed my share[3] to perpetuate theachievements of a people, the lords of the world; and if, amidst sogreat a number of historians,[4] my reputation should remain inobscurity, I may console myself with the celebrity and lustre of thosewho shall stand in the way of my fame. Moreover, the subject is both ofimmense labour, as being one which must be traced back for more thanseven hundred years, and which, having set out from small beginnings,has increased to such a degree that it is now distressed by its ownmagnitude. And, to most readers, I doubt not but that the first originand the events immediately succeeding, will afford but little pleasure,while they will be hastening to these later times,[5] in which thestrength of this overgrown people has for a long period been working itsown destruction. I, on the contrary, shall seek this, as a reward of mylabour, viz. to withdraw myself from the view of the calamities, whichour age has witnessed for so many years, so long as I am reviewing withmy whole attention these ancient times, being free from every care[6]that may distract a writer's mind, though it cannot warp it from thetruth. The traditions which have come down to us of what happened beforethe building of the city, or before its building was contemplated, asbeing suitable rather to the fictions of poetry than to the genuinerecords of history, I have no intention either to affirm or refute. Thisindulgence is conceded to antiquity, that by blending things human withdivine, it may make the origin of cities appear more venerable: and ifany people might be allowed to consecrate their origin, and to ascribeit to the gods as its authors, such is the renown of the Roman people inwar, that when they represent Mars, in particular, as their own parentand that of their founder, the nations of the world may submit to thisas patiently as they submit to their sovereignty.--But in whatever waythese and such like matters shall be attended to, or judged of, I shallnot deem of great importance. I would have every man apply his mindseriously to consider these points, viz. what their life and what theirmanners were; through what men and by what measures, both in peace andin war, their empire was acquired[7] and extended; then, as disciplinegradually declined, let him follow in his thoughts their morals, atfirst as slightly giving way, anon how they sunk more and more, thenbegan to fall headlong, until he reaches the present times, when we canneither endure our vices, nor their remedies. This it is which isparticularly salutary and profitable in the study of history, that youbehold instances of every variety of conduct displayed on a conspicuousmonument; that from thence you may select for yourself and for yourcountry that which you may imitate; thence _note_ what is shameful inthe undertaking, and shameful in the result, which you may avoid. Buteither a fond partiality for the task I have undertaken deceives me, orthere never was any state either greater, or more moral, or richer ingood examples, nor one into which luxury and avarice made their entranceso late, and where poverty and frugality were so much and so longhonoured; so that the less wealth there was, the less desire was there.Of late, riches have introduced avarice, and excessive pleasures alonging for them, amidst luxury and a passion for ruining ourselves anddestroying every thing else. But let complaints, which will not beagreeable even then, when perhaps they will be also necessary, be keptaloof at least from the first stage of commencing so great a work. Weshould rather, if it was usual with us (historians) as it is with poets,begin with good omens, vows and prayers to the gods and goddesses tovouchsafe good success to our efforts in so arduous an undertaking."Book 1,Chapter 1,"Now first of all it is sufficiently established that, Troy having beentaken, the utmost severity was shown to all the other Trojans; but thattowards two, ®neas and Antenor, the Greeks forbore all the rights ofwar, both in accordance with an ancient tie of hospitality, and becausethey had ever been the advisers of peace, and of the restoration ofHelen--then that Antenor after various vicissitudes came into theinnermost bay of the Adriatic Sea, with a body of the Heneti, who havingbeen driven from Paphlagonia in consequence of a civil commotion, werein quest both of a settlement and a leader, their king Pyl¾menes havingbeen lost at Troy; and that the Heneti and Trojans, having expelled theEuganei, who dwelt between the sea and the Alps, took possession of thecountry; and the place where they first landed is called Troy; fromwhence also the name of Trojan is given to the canton; but the nation ingeneral is called Veneti: that ®neas was driven from home by a similarcalamity, but the fates leading him to the founding of a greater empire,he came first to Macedonia: that he sailed from thence to Sicily inquest of a settlement: that from Sicily he made for the Laurentineterritory; this place also has the name of Troy. When the Trojans,having disembarked there, were driving plunder from the lands,--as beingpersons to whom, after their almost immeasurable wandering, nothing wasleft but their arms and ships,--Latinus the king, and the Aborigines,who then occupied those places, assembled in arms from the city andcountry to repel the violence of the new-comers. On this point thetradition is two-fold: some say, that Latinus, after being overcome inbattle, made first a peace, and then an alliance with ®neas: others,that when the armies were drawn out in battle-array, before the signalswere sounded, Latinus advanced to the front of the troops and invitedthe leader of the adventurers to a conference. That he then inquired whothey were, whence (they had come), or by what casualty they had lefttheir home, and in quest of what they had landed on the Laurentineterritory: after he heard that the host were Trojans, their chief ®neas,the son of Anchises and Venus, and that, driven from their own countryand their homes, which had been destroyed by fire, they were seeking asettlement and a place for building a town, struck with admiration ofthe noble origin of the nation and of the hero, and their spirit, alikeprepared for peace or war, he confirmed the assurance of futurefriendship by giving his right hand: that upon this a compact was struckbetween the chiefs, and mutual greetings passed between the armies: that®neas was hospitably entertained by Latinus: that Latinus, in thepresence of his household gods, added a family league to the public one,by giving ®neas his daughter in marriage. This event confirms theTrojans in the hope of at length terminating their wanderings by a fixedand permanent settlement. They build a town. ®neas calls it Lavinium,after the name of his wife. In a short time, too, a son was the issue ofthe new marriage, to whom his parents gave the name of Ascanius."Book 1,Chapter 2,"The Aborigines and Trojans were soon after attacked together in war.Turnus, king of the Rutulians, to whom Lavinia had been affianced beforethe coming of ®neas, enraged that a stranger had been preferred tohimself, made war on ®neas and Latinus together. Neither side came offfrom that contest with cause for rejoicing. The Rutulians werevanquished; the victorious Aborigines and Trojans lost their leaderLatinus. Upon this Turnus and the Rutulians, diffident of theirstrength, have recourse to the flourishing state of the Etruscans, andtheir king Mezentius; who holding his court at CÏre, at that time anopulent town, being by no means pleased, even from the commencement, atthe founding of the new city, and then considering that the Trojan powerwas increasing much more than was altogether consistent with the safetyof the neighbouring states, without reluctance joined his forces inalliance with the Rutulians. ®neas, in order to conciliate the minds ofthe Aborigines to meet the terror of so serious a war, called bothnations Latins, so that they might all be not only under the same laws,but also the same name. Nor after that did the Aborigines yield to theTrojans in zeal and fidelity towards their king ®neas; relying thereforeon this disposition of the two nations, who were now daily coalescingmore and more, although Etruria was so powerful, that it filled with thefame of its prowess not only the land, but the sea also, through thewhole length of Italy, from the Alps to the Sicilian Strait, though hemight have repelled the war by means of fortifications, yet he led outhis forces to the field. Upon this a battle ensued successful to theLatins, the last also of the mortal acts of ®neas. He was buried, bywhatever name human and divine laws require him to be called,[8] on thebanks of the river Numicius. They call him Jupiter Indiges."Book 1,Chapter 3,"Ascanius, the son of ®neas, was not yet old enough to take thegovernment upon him; that government, however, remained secure for himtill the age of maturity. In the interim, the Latin state and thekingdom of his grandfather and father was secured for the boy under theregency of his mother (such capacity was there in Lavinia). I have somedoubts (for who can state as certain a matter of such antiquity) whetherthis was the Ascanius, or one older than he, born of Creusa before thefall of Troy, and the companion of his father in his flight from thence,the same whom, being called Iulus, the Julian family call the author oftheir name. This Ascanius, wheresoever and of whatever mother born, (itis at least certain that he was the son of ®neas,) Lavinium beingoverstocked with inhabitants, left that flourishing and, consideringthese times, wealthy city to his mother or step-mother, and built forhimself a new one at the foot of Mount Alba, which, being extended onthe ridge of a hill, was, from its situation, called Longa Alba. Betweenthe founding of Lavinium and the transplanting this colony to LongaAlba, about thirty years intervened. Yet its power had increased to sucha degree, especially after the defeat of the Etrurians, that not evenupon the death of ®neas, nor after that, during the regency of Lavinia,and the first essays of the young prince's reign, did Mezentius, theEtrurians, or any other of its neighbours dare to take up arms againstit. A peace had been concluded between the two nations on these terms,that the river Albula, now called Tiber, should be the common boundarybetween the Etrurians and Latins. After him Sylvius, the son ofAscanius, born by some accident in a wood, ascends the throne. He wasthe father of ®neas Sylvius, who afterwards begot Latinus Sylvius. Byhim several colonies, called the ancient Latins, were transplanted. Fromthis time, all the princes, who reigned at Alba, had the surname ofSylvius. From Latinus sprung Alba; from Alba, Atys; from Atys, Capys;from Capys, Capetus; from Capetus, Tiberinus, who, being drowned incrossing the river Albula, gave it a name famous with posterity. ThenAgrippa, the son of Tiberinus; after Agrippa, Romulus Silvius ascendsthe throne, in succession to his father. The latter, having been killedby a thunderbolt, left the kingdom to Aventinus, who being buried onthat hill, which is now part of the city of Rome, gave his name to it.After him reigns Proca; he begets Numitor and Amulius. To Numitor, hiseldest son, he bequeaths the ancient kingdom of the Sylvian family. Butforce prevailed more than the father's will or the respect due toseniority: for Amulius, having expelled his brother, seizes the kingdom;he adds crime to crime, murders his brother's male issue; and underpretence of doing his brother's daughter, Rhea Sylvia, honour, havingmade her a vestal virgin, by obliging her to perpetual virginity hedeprives her of all hopes of issue."Book 1,Chapter 4,"But, in my opinion, the origin of so great a city, and theestablishment of an empire next in power to that of the gods, was due tothe Fates. The vestal Rhea, being deflowered by force, when she hadbrought forth twins, declares Mars to be the father of her illegitimateoffspring, either because she believed it to be so, or because a god wasa more creditable author of her offence. But neither gods nor menprotect her or her children from the king's cruelty: the priestess isbound and thrown into prison; the children he commands to be thrown intothe current of the river. By some interposition of providence,[9] theTiber having overflowed its banks in stagnant pools, did not admit ofany access to the regular bed of the river; and the bearers supposedthat the infants could be drowned in water however still; thus, as ifthey had effectually executed the king's orders, they expose the boys inthe nearest land-flood, where now stands the ficus Ruminalis (they saythat it was called Romularis). The country thereabout was then a vastwilderness. The tradition is, that when the water, subsiding, had leftthe floating trough, in which the children had been exposed, on dryground, a thirsty she-wolf, coming from the neighbouring mountains,directed her course to the cries of the infants, and that she held downher dugs to them with so much gentleness, that the keeper of the king'sflock found her licking the boys with her tongue. It is said his namewas Faustulus; and that they were carried by him to his homestead to benursed by his wife Laurentia. Some are of opinion that she was calledLupa among the shepherds, from her being a common prostitute, and thatthis gave rise to the surprising story. The children thus born and thusbrought up, when arrived at the years of manhood, did not loiter awaytheir time in tending the folds or following the flocks, but roamed andhunted in the forests. Having by this exercise improved their strengthand courage, they not only encountered wild beasts, but even attackedrobbers laden with plunder, and afterwards divided the spoil among theshepherds. And in company with these, the number of their youngassociates daily increasing, they carried on their business and theirsports."Book 1,Chapter 5,"They say, that the festival of the lupercal, as now celebrated, waseven at that time solemnized on the Palatine hill, which, fromPalanteum, a city of Arcadia, was first called Palatium, and afterwardsMount Palatine. There they say that Evander, who belonged to the tribeof Arcadians,[10] that for many years before had possessed that country,appointed the observance of a feast, introduced from Arcadia, in suchmanner, that young men ran about naked in sport and wantonness, doinghonour to Pan Lyc¾us, whom the Romans afterwards called Inuus. That therobbers, through rage at the loss of their booty, having lain in waitfor them whilst intent on this sport, as the festival was now wellknown, whilst Romulus vigorously defended himself, took Remus prisoner;that they delivered him up, when taken, to king Amulius, accusing himwith the utmost effrontery. They principally alleged it as a chargeagainst them, that they had made incursions upon Numitor's lands, andplundered them in a hostile manner, having assembled a band of young menfor the purpose. Upon this Remus was delivered to Numitor to bepunished. Now, from the very first, Faustulus had entertained hopes thatthe boys whom he was bringing up were of the blood royal; for he bothknew that the children had been exposed by the king's orders, and thatthe time at which he had taken them up agreed exactly with that period:but he had been unwilling that the matter, as not being yet ripe fordiscovery, should be disclosed, till either a fit opportunity ornecessity should arise. Necessity came first; accordingly, compelled byfear, he discovers the whole affair to Romulus. By accident also, whilsthe had Remus in custody, and had heard that the brothers were twins, oncomparing their age, and _observing_ their turn of mind entirely freefrom servility, the recollection of his grand-children struck Numitor;and on making inquiries[11] he arrived at the same conclusion, so thathe was well nigh recognising Remus. Thus a plot is concerted for theking on all sides. Romulus, not accompanied by a body of young men, (forhe was unequal to open force,) but having commanded the shepherds tocome to the palace by different roads at a fixed time, forces his way tothe king; and Remus, with another party from Numitor's house, assistshis brother, and so they kill the king."Book 1,Chapter 6,"Numitor, at the beginning of the fray, having given out that enemieshad invaded the city, and assaulted the palace, after he had drawn offthe Alban youth to secure the citadel with a garrison and arms, when hesaw the young men, after they had killed the king, advancing tocongratulate him, immediately called an assembly of the people, andrepresented to them the unnatural behaviour of his brother towards him,the extraction of his grand-children, the manner of their birth andeducation, and how they came to be discovered; then he informed them ofthe king's death, and that he was killed by his orders. When the youngprinces, coming up with their band through the middle of the assembly,saluted their grandfather king, an approving shout, following from allthe people present, ratified to him both that title and the sovereignty.Thus the government of Alba being committed to Numitor, a desire seizedRomulus and Remus to build a city on the spot where they had beenexposed and brought up. And there was an overflowing population ofAlbans and of Latins. The shepherds too had come into that design, andall these readily inspired hopes, that Alba and Lavinium would be butpetty places in comparison with the city which they intended to build.But ambition of the sovereignty, the bane of their grandfather,interrupted these designs, and thence arose a shameful quarrel from abeginning sufficiently amicable. For as they were twins, and the respectdue to seniority could not determine the point, they agreed to leave tothe tutelary gods of the place to choose, by augury, which should give aname to the new city, which govern it when built."Book 1,Chapter 7,"Romulus chose the Palatine and Remus the Aventine hill as theirstands to make their observations. It is said, that to Remus an omencame first, six vultures; and now, the omen having been declared, whendouble the number presented itself to Romulus, his own party salutedeach king; the former claimed the kingdom on the ground of priority oftime, the latter on account of the number of birds. Upon this, havingmet in an altercation, from the contest of angry feelings they turn tobloodshed; there Remus fell from a blow received in the crowd. A morecommon account is, that Remus, in derision of his brother, leaped overhis new-built wall, and was, for that reason, slain by Romulus in apassion; who, after sharply chiding him, added words to this effect: ""Soshall every one fare, who shall dare to leap over myfortifications.""[12] Thus Romulus got the sovereignty to himself; thecity, when built, was called after the name of its founder. His firstwork was to fortify the Palatine hill where he had been educated. To theother gods he offers sacrifices according to the Alban rite; toHercules, according to the Grecian rite, as they had been instituted byEvander. There is a tradition, that Hercules, having killed Geryon,drove his oxen, which were extremely beautiful, into those places; andthat, after swimming over the Tiber, and driving the cattle before him,being fatigued with travelling, he laid himself down on the banks of theriver, in a grassy place, to refresh them with rest and rich pasture.When sleep had overpowered him, satiated with food and wine, a shepherdof the place, named Cacus, presuming on his strength, and charmed withthe beauty of the oxen, wished to purloin that booty, but because, if hehad driven them forward into the cave, their footsteps would have guidedthe search of their owner thither, he therefore drew the most beautifulof them, one by one, by the tails, backwards into a cave. Hercules,awaking at day-break, when he had surveyed his herd, and observed thatsome of them were missing, goes directly to the nearest cave, to see ifby chance their footsteps would lead him thither. But when he observedthat they were all turned from it, and directed him no other way,confounded, and not knowing what to do, he began to drive his cattleout of that unlucky place. Upon this, some of the cows, as they usuallydo, lowed on missing those that were left; and the lowings of those thatwere confined being returned from the cave, made Hercules turn that way.And when Cacus attempted to prevent him by force, as he was proceedingto the cave, being struck with a club, he was slain, vainly imploringthe assistance of the shepherds. At that time Evander, who had fled fromthe Peloponnesus, ruled this country more by his credit and reputationthan absolute sway. He was a person highly revered for his wondrousknowledge of letters,[13] a discovery that was entirely new andsurprising to men ignorant of every art; but more highly respected onaccount of the supposed divinity of his mother Carmenta, whom thesenations had admired as a prophetess, before the coming of the Sibyl intoItaly. This prince, alarmed by the concourse of the shepherds hastilycrowding round the stranger, whom they charged with open murder, afterhe heard the act and the cause of the act, observing the person and mienof the hero to be larger, and his gait more majestic, than human, askedwho he was? As soon as he was informed of his name, his father, and hisnative country, he said, ""Hail! Hercules! son of Jupiter, my mother, atruth-telling interpreter of the gods, has revealed to me, that thoushalt increase the number of the celestials; and that to thee an altarshall be dedicated here, which some ages hence the most powerful peopleon earth shall call Ara Maxima, and honour according to thy owninstitution."" Hercules having given him his right hand, said, ""That heaccepted the omen, and would fulfil the predictions of the fates, bybuilding and consecrating an altar."" There for the first time asacrifice was offered to Hercules of a chosen heifer, taken from theherd, the Potitii and Pinarii, who were then the most distinguishedfamilies that inhabited these parts, having been invited to the serviceand the entertainment. It so happened that the Potitii were present indue time, and the entrails were set before them; when they were eatenup, the Pinarii came to the remainder of the feast. From this time itwas ordained, that while the Pinarian family subsisted, none of themshould eat of the entrails of the solemn sacrifices. The Potitii, beinginstructed by Evander, discharged this sacred function as priests formany ages, until the office, solemnly appropriated to their family,being delegated to public slaves, their whole race became extinct. Thiswas the only foreign religious institution which Romulus adopted, beingeven then an abettor of immortality attained by merit, to which his owndestinies were conducting him."Book 1,Chapter 8,"The duties of religion having been duly performed, and the multitudesummoned to a meeting, as they could be incorporated into one people byno other means than fixed rules, he gave them a code of laws, andjudging that these would be best respected by this rude class of men, ifhe made himself dignified by the insignia of authority, he assumed amore majestic appearance both in his other appointments, and especiallyby taking twelve lictors to attend him. Some think that he chose thisnumber of officers from that of the birds, which in the augury hadportended the kingdom to him. I do not object to be of the opinion ofthose who will have it that the apparitors (in general), and thisparticular class of them,[14] and even their number, was taken fromtheir neighbours the Etrurians, from whom were borrowed the curulechair, and the gown edged with purple; and that the Etrurians adoptedthat number, because their king being elected in common from twelvestates, each state assigned him one lictor. Meanwhile the city increasedby their taking in various lots of ground for buildings, whilst theybuilt rather with a view to future numbers, than for the population[15]which they then had. Then, lest the size of the city might be of noavail, in order to augment the population, according to the ancientpolicy of the founders of cities, who, after drawing together to them anobscure and mean multitude, used to feign that their offspring sprungout of the earth, he opened as a sanctuary, a place which is nowenclosed as you go down ""to the two groves.""[16] Hither fled from theneighbouring states, without distinction whether freemen or slaves,crowds of all sorts, desirous of change: and this was the firstaccession of strength to their rising greatness. When he was now notdissatisfied with his strength, he next sets about forming some means ofdirecting that strength. He creates one hundred senators, either becausethat number was sufficient, or because there were only one hundred whocould name their fathers. They certainly were called Fathers, throughrespect, and their descendants, Patricians."Book 1,Chapter 9,"And now the Roman state was become so powerful, that it was a matchfor any of the neighbouring nations in war, but, from the paucity ofwomen, its greatness could only last for one age of man; for they had nohope of issue at home, nor had they any intermarriages with theirneighbours. Therefore, by the advice of the Fathers, Romulus sentambassadors to the neighbouring states to solicit an alliance and theprivilege of intermarriage for his new subjects. ""That cities, likeevery thing else, rose from very humble beginnings. That those which thegods and their own merit aided, gained great power and high renown. Thathe knew full well, both that the gods had aided the origin of Rome, andthat merit would not be wanting. Wherefore that, as men, they shouldfeel no reluctance to mix their blood and race with men."" No where didthe embassy obtain a favourable hearing: so much did they at the sametime despise, and dread for themselves and their posterity, so great apower growing up in the midst of them. They were dismissed by thegreater part with the repeated question, ""Whether they had opened anyasylum for women also, for that such a plan only could obtain themsuitable matches?"" The Roman youth resented this conduct bitterly, andthe matter unquestionably began to point towards violence. Romulus, inorder that he might afford a favourable time and place for this,dissembling his resentment, purposely prepares games in honour ofNeptunus Equestris; he calls them Consualia. He then orders thespectacle to be proclaimed among their neighbours; and they prepare forthe celebration with all the magnificence they were then acquaintedwith, or were capable of doing, that they might render the matterfamous, and an object of expectation. Great numbers assembled, from adesire also of seeing the new city; especially their nearest neighbours,the C¾ninenses, Crustumini, and Antemnates. Moreover the whole multitudeof the Sabines came, with their wives and children. Having beenhospitably invited to the different houses, when they had seen thesituation, and fortifications, and the city crowded with houses, theybecame astonished that the Roman power had increased so rapidly. Whenthe time of the spectacle came on, and while their minds and eyes wereintent upon it, according to concert a tumult began, and upon a signalgiven the Roman youth ran different ways to carry off the virgins byforce. A great number were carried off at hap-hazard, according as theyfell into their hands. Persons from the common people, who had beencharged with the task, conveyed to their houses some women of surpassingbeauty, destined for the leading senators. They say that one, fardistinguished beyond the others for stature and beauty, was carried offby the party of one Thalassius, and whilst many inquired to whom theywere carrying her, they cried out every now and then, in order that noone might molest her, that she was being taken to Thalassius; that fromthis circumstance this term became a nuptial one. The festival beingdisturbed by this alarm, the parents of the young women retire in grief,appealing to the compact of violated hospitality, and invoking the god,to whose festival and games they had come, deceived by the pretence ofreligion and good faith. Neither had the ravished virgins better hopesof their condition, or less indignation. But Romulus in person wentabout and declared, ""That what was done was owing to the pride of theirfathers, who had refused to grant the privilege of marriage to theirneighbours; but notwithstanding, they should be joined in lawfulwedlock, participate in all their possessions and civil privileges, and,than which nothing can be dearer to the human heart, in their commonchildren. He begged them only to assuage the fierceness of their anger,and cheerfully surrender their affections to those to whom fortune hadconsigned their persons."" [He added,] ""That from injuries love andfriendship often arise; and that they should find them kinder husbandson this account, because each of them, besides the performance of hisconjugal duty, would endeavour to the utmost of his power to make up forthe want of their parents and native country."" To this the caresses ofthe husbands were added, excusing what they had done on the plea ofpassion and love, arguments that work most successfully on women'shearts."Book 1,Chapter 10,"The minds of the ravished virgins were soon much soothed, but theirparents by putting on mourning, and tears and complaints, roused thestates. Nor did they confine their resentment to their own homes, butthey flocked from all quarters to Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines; andbecause he bore the greatest character in these parts, embassies weresent to him. The C¾ninenses, Crustumini, and Antemnates were people towhom a considerable portion of the outrage extended. To them Tatius andthe Sabines seemed to proceed somewhat dilatorily. Nor even do theCrustumini and Antemnates bestir themselves with sufficient activity tosuit the impatience and rage of the C¾ninenses. Accordingly the state ofthe C¾ninenses by itself makes an irruption into the Roman territory.But Romulus with his army met them ravaging the country in stragglingparties, and by a slight engagement convinces them, that resentmentwithout strength is of no avail. He defeats and routs their army,pursues it when routed, kills and despoils their king in battle, andhaving slain their general takes the city at the first assault. Fromthence having led back his victorious army, and being a man highlydistinguished by his exploits, and one who could place them in the bestlight, went in state to the capitol, carrying before him, suspended on aframe curiously wrought for that purpose, the spoils of the enemy'sgeneral, whom he had slain, and there after he had laid them down at thefoot of an oak held sacred by the shepherds, together with the offering,he marked out the bounds for a temple of Jupiter, and gave a surname tothe god: ""Jupiter Feretrius,"" he says, ""I, king Romulus, upon myvictory, present to thee these royal arms, and to thee I dedicate atemple within those regions which I have now marked out in my mind, as areceptacle for the grand spoils, which my successors, following myexample, shall, upon their killing the kings or generals of the enemy,offer to thee."" This is the origin of that temple, the first consecratedat Rome. It afterwards so pleased the gods both that the declaration ofthe founder of the temple should not be frustrated, by which heannounced that his posterity should offer such spoils, and that theglory of that offering should not be depreciated by the great number ofthose who shared it. During so many years, and amid so many wars sincethat time, grand spoils have been only twice gained,[18] so rare hasbeen the successful attainment of that honour."Book 1,Chapter 11,"Whilst the Romans are achieving these exploits, the army of theAntemnates, taking advantage of their absence, makes an incursion intothe Roman territories in a hostile manner. A Roman legion being marchedout in haste against these also, surprise them whilst straggling throughthe fields. Accordingly the enemy were routed at the very first shoutand charge: their town taken; and as Romulus was returning, exulting forthis double victory, his consort, Hersilia, importuned by the entreatiesof the captured women, beseeches him ""to pardon their fathers, and toadmit them to the privilege of citizens; that thus his power might bestrengthened by a reconciliation."" Her request was readily granted.After this he marched against the Crustumini, who were commencinghostilities; but as their spirits were sunk by the defeat of theirneighbours, there was still less resistance there. Colonies were sent toboth places, but more were found to give in their names for Crustuminum,because of the fertility of the soil. Migrations in great numbers werealso made from thence to Rome, chiefly by the parents and relatives ofthe ravished women. The last war broke out on the part of the Sabines,and proved by far the most formidable: for they did nothing throughanger or cupidity; nor did they make a show of war, before they actuallybegan it. To prudence stratagem also was added. Sp. Tarpeius commandedthe Roman citadel; Tatius bribes his maiden daughter with gold, to admitarmed soldiers into the citadel: she had gone by chance outside thewalls to fetch water for the sacrifice. Those who were admitted crushedher to death by heaping their arms upon her; either that the citadelmight seem rather to have been taken by storm, or for the purpose ofestablishing a precedent, that no faith should, under any circumstances,be kept with a traitor. A story is added, that the Sabines commonly woreon their left arm golden bracelets of great weight, and large rings setwith precious stones, and that she bargained with them for what they hadon their left hands; hence that their shields were thrown upon herinstead of the golden presents. There are some who say that in pursuanceof the compact to deliver up what was on their left hands, she expresslydemanded their shields, and that appearing to act with treachery, shewas killed by the reward of her own choosing."Book 1,Chapter 12,"The Sabines, however, kept possession of the citadel, and on the dayafter, when the Roman army, drawn up in order of battle, filled up allthe ground lying between the Palatine and Capitoline hills, they did notdescend from thence into the plain, till the Romans, fired withresentment, and with a desire of retaking the citadel, advanced toattack them. Two chiefs, one on each side, animated the battle, viz.Mettus Curtius on the part of the Sabines, Hostus Hostilius on that ofthe Romans. The latter, in the front ranks, supported the Roman cause byhis courage and bravery, on disadvantageous ground. As soon as Hostusfell, the Roman line immediately gave way and was beaten to the old gateof the Palatium. Romulus, himself too carried away with the generalrout, raising his arms to heaven, says, ""O Jupiter, commanded by thybirds, I here laid the first foundation of the city on the Palatinehill. The Sabines are in possession of the citadel, purchased by fraud.From thence they are now advancing hither, sword in hand, having alreadypassed the middle of the valley. But do thou, father of gods and men,keep back the enemy at least from hence, dispel the terror of theRomans, and stop their shameful flight. Here I solemnly vow to build atemple to thee as Jupiter Stator, as a monument to posterity, that thiscity was saved by thy immediate aid."" Having offered up this prayer, asif he had felt that his prayers were heard, he cries out, ""At this spot,Romans, Jupiter, supremely good and great, commands you to halt, andrenew the fight."" The Romans halted as if they had been commanded by avoice from heaven; Romulus himself flies to the foremost ranks. MettusCurtius, on the part of the Sabines, had rushed down at the head of hisarmy from the citadel, and driven the Romans in disorder over the wholeground now occupied by the forum. He was already not far from the gateof the Palatium, crying out, ""We have defeated these perfidiousstrangers, these dastardly enemies. They now feel that it is one thingto ravish virgins, another far different to fight with men."" On him,thus vaunting, Romulus makes an attack with a band of the mostcourageous youths. It happened that Mettus was then fighting onhorseback; he was on that account the more easily repulsed: the Romanspursue him when repulsed: and the rest of the Roman army, encouraged bythe gallant behaviour of their king, routs the Sabines. Mettus, hishorse taking fright at the din of his pursuers, threw himself into alake; and this circumstance drew the attention of the Sabines at therisk of so important a person. He, however, his own party beckoning andcalling to him, acquires new courage from the affection of his manyfriends, and makes his escape. The Romans and Sabines renew the battlein the valley between the hills; but Roman prowess had the advantage."Book 1,Chapter 13,"At this juncture the Sabine women, from the outrage on whom the waroriginated, with hair dishevelled and garments rent, the timidity oftheir sex being overcome by such dreadful scenes, had the courage tothrow themselves amid the flying weapons, and making a rush across, topart the incensed armies, and assuage their fury; imploring theirfathers on the one side, their husbands on the other, ""that asfathers-in-law and sons-in-law they would not contaminate each otherwith impious blood, nor stain their offspring with parricide, the one[19]their grandchildren, the other their children. If you aredissatisfied with the affinity between you, if with our marriages, turnyour resentment against us; we are the cause of war, we of wounds and ofbloodshed to our husbands and parents. It were better that we perishthan live widowed or fatherless without one or other of you."" Thecircumstance affects both the multitude and the leaders. Silence and asudden suspension ensue. Upon this the leaders come forward in order toconcert a treaty, and they not only conclude a peace, but form one stateout of two. They associate the regal power, and transfer the entiresovereignty to Rome. The city being thus doubled, that some complimentmight be paid to the Sabines, they were called Quirites, from Cures. Asa memorial of this battle, they called the place where the horse, aftergetting out of the deep marsh, first set Curtius in shallow water, theCurtian Lake. This happy peace following suddenly a war so distressing,rendered the Sabine women still dearer to their husbands and parents,and above all to Romulus himself. Accordingly, when he divided thepeople into thirty curi¾, he called the curi¾ by their names. Since,without doubt, the number of the Sabine women was considerably greaterthan this, it is not recorded whether those who were to give their namesto the curi¾ were selected on account of their age, or their own ortheir husbands' rank, or by lot. At the same time three centuries ofknights were enrolled, called Ramnenses, from Romulus; Tatienses, fromTitus Tatius. The reason of the name and origin of the Luceres isuncertain."Book 1,Chapter 14,"Thenceforward the two kings held the regal power not only in common,but in concord also. Several years after, some relatives of king Tatiusbeat the ambassadors of the Laurentes, and when the Laurentes commencedproceedings according to the law of nations, the influence of hisfriends and their importunities had more weight with Tatius. Hetherefore drew upon himself the punishment due to them; for he is slainat Lavinium, in a tumult which arose on his going thither to ananniversary sacrifice. They say that Romulus resented this with lessseverity than the case required, either by reason of their associationin the kingly power being devoid of cordiality, or because he believedthat he was justly killed. He therefore declined going to war; in order,however, that the ill-treatment of the ambassadors and the murder of theking might be expiated, the treaty was renewed between the cities ofRome and Lavinium. With this party, indeed, peace continued, contrary toexpectation; another war broke out much nearer home, and almost at thevery gates. The Fidenates, thinking that a power too near to themselveswas growing to a height, resolve to make war, before their strengthshould become as great as it was apparent it would be. An armed body ofyoung men being sent in, all the land is laid waste between the city andFiden¾. Then turning to the left, because the Tiber confined them on theright, they continue their depredations to the great consternation ofthe peasantry. The sudden alarm reaching the city from the country,served as the first announcement. Romulus, roused at this circumstance,(for a war so near home could not admit of delay,) leads out his army:he pitches his camp a mile from Fiden¾. Having left there a smallgarrison, marching out with all his forces, he commanded a party of hissoldiers to lie in ambush in a place [20]hidden by thick bushes whichwere planted around. Then advancing with the greater part of the footand all the horse, and riding up to the very gates of the city in adisorderly and menacing manner, he drew out the enemy, the very thing hewanted. The same mode of fighting on the part of the cavalry likewisemade the cause of the flight, which was to be counterfeited, appear lesssurprising: and when, the horse seeming irresolute, as if indeliberation whether to fight or fly, the infantry also retreated, theenemy suddenly rushed from the crowded gates, after they had made animpression on the Roman line, are drawn on to the place of ambuscade intheir eagerness to press on and pursue. Upon this the Romans, risingsuddenly, attack the enemy's line in flank. The standards of those whohad been left behind on guard, advancing from the camp, further increasethe panic. The Fidenates, thus dismayed with terrors from so manyquarters, turn their backs almost before Romulus, and those who hadaccompanied him on horseback, could wheel their horses round; and thosewho a little before had pursued men pretending to fly, now ran back tothe town in much greater disorder, for their flight was in earnest. Theydid not however get clear of the enemy: the Romans pressing on theirrear rush in as it were in one body before the gates could be shutagainst them."Book 1,Chapter 15,"The minds of the Veientes being excited by the contagious influenceof the Fidenatian war, both from the tie of consanguinity, for theFidenates also were Etrurians, and because the very proximity ofsituation, in case the Roman arms should be turned against all theirneighbours, urged them on, they made an incursion on the Romanterritories, more to commit depredations than after the manner of aregular war. Accordingly, without pitching a camp, or awaiting theapproach of the enemy's army, they returned to Veii, carrying with themthe booty collected from the lands; the Roman army on the other side,when they did not find the enemy in the country, being prepared for anddetermined on a decisive action, cross the Tiber. And when the Veientesheard that they were pitching a camp, and intended to advance to thecity, they came out to meet them, that they might rather decide thematter in the open field, than be shut up and fight from their housesand walls. Here the Roman king obtained the victory, his power not beingaided by any stratagem, merely by the strength of his veteran army: andhaving pursued the routed enemies to their walls, he made no attempt onthe city, strong as it was by its fortifications, and well defended byits situation: on his return he lays waste their lands, rather from adesire of revenge than booty. And the Veientes, being humbled by thatloss no less than by the unsuccessful battle, send ambassadors to Rometo sue for peace. A truce for one hundred years was granted them afterthey were fined a part of their land. These are the principaltransactions which occurred during the reign of Romulus, in peace andwar, none of which seem inconsistent with the belief of his divineoriginal, or of the deification attributed to him after death, neitherhis spirit in recovering his grandfather's kingdom, nor his project ofbuilding a city, nor that of strengthening it by the arts of war andpeace. For by the strength attained from that outset under him, itbecame so powerful, that for forty years after it enjoyed a profoundpeace. He was, however, dearer to the people than to the fathers; butabove all others he was most beloved by the soldiers. And he kept threehundred of them armed as a body-guard not only in war but in peace, whomhe called Celeres."Book 1,Chapter 16,"After performing these immortal achievements, while he was holdingan assembly of the people for reviewing his army, in the plain near thelake of Capra, on a sudden a storm having arisen, with great thunder andlightning, enveloped the king in so dense a mist, that it took all sightof him from the assembly. Nor was Romulus after this seen on earth. Theconsternation being at length over, and fine clear weather succeeding soturbulent a day, when the Roman youth saw the royal seat empty, thoughthey readily believed the fathers who had stood nearest him, that he wascarried aloft by the storm, yet, struck with the dread as it were oforphanage, they preserved a sorrowful silence for a considerable time.Then, a commencement having been made by a few, the whole multitudesalute Romulus a god, son of a god, the king and parent of the Romancity; they implore his favour with prayers, that he would be pleasedalways propitiously to preserve his own offspring. I believe that eventhen there were some, who silently surmised that the king had been tornin pieces by the hands of the fathers; for this rumour also spread, butwas not credited; their admiration of the man, and the consternationfelt at the moment, attached importance to the other report. By thecontrivance also of one individual, additional credit is said to havebeen gained to the matter. For Proculus Julius, whilst the state wasstill troubled with regret for the king, and felt incensed against thesenators, a person of weight, as we are told, in any matter howeverimportant, comes forward to the assembly, ""Romans,"" he says, ""Romulus,the father of this city, suddenly descending from heaven, appeared to methis day at day-break. While I stood covered with awe, and filled with areligious dread, beseeching him to allow me to see him face to face, hesaid, Go tell the Romans, that the gods so will, that my Rome shouldbecome the capitol of the world. Therefore let them cultivate the art ofwar, and let them know and hand down to posterity, that no human powershall be able to withstand the Roman arms. Having said this, he ascendedup to heaven."" It is surprising what credit was given to the man on hismaking this announcement, and how much the regret of the common peopleand army, for the loss of Romulus, was assuaged upon the assurance ofhis immortality."Book 1,Chapter 17,"Meanwhile ambition and contention for the throne actuated the mindsof the fathers; factions had not yet sprung up from individuals,because, among a new people, no one person was eminently distinguishedabove the rest: the contest was carried on between the different orders.The descendants of the Sabines wished a king to be elected out of theirbody, lest, because there had been no king on their side since the deathof Tatius, they might lose their claim to the crown[21] according to thecompact of equal participation. The old Romans spurned the idea of aforeign prince. Amid this diversity of views, however, all were anxiousthat there should be a king, they not having yet tasted the sweets ofliberty. Fear then seized the senators, lest the minds of thesurrounding states being incensed against them, some foreign powershould attack the state, now without a government, and the army withouta leader. It was therefore their wish that there should be some head,but no one could bring himself to give way to another. Thus the hundredsenators divide the government among them, ten decuries being formed,and one selected from each decury, who was to have the chief directionof affairs. Ten governed; one only was attended with the insignia ofauthority and the lictors: their power was limited to the space of fivedays, and it passed through all in rotation, and the interval between akingly government lasted a year. From the circumstance it was called anInterregnum, a term which holds good even now. But the people began tomurmur, that their slavery was multiplied, and that they had got ahundred sovereigns instead of one, and they seemed determined to bear noauthority but that of a king, and that one of their own choosing. Whenthe fathers perceived that such schemes were in agitation, thinking itadvisable to offer them, of their own accord, what they were sure tolose; they thus conciliate the favour of the people by yielding to themthe supreme power, yet in such a manner as to grant them no greaterprivilege than they reserved to themselves. For they decreed, that whenthe people should choose a king, the election should be valid, if thesenate approved. And[22] the same forms are observed at this day inpassing laws and electing magistrates, though their efficacy has beentaken away; for before the people begin to vote, the senators declaretheir approbation, whilst the result of the elections is stilluncertain. Then the interrex, having called an assembly of the people,addressed them in this manner: ""Do you, Romans, choose yourselves aking, and may it prove fortunate, happy, and auspicious to you; so thefathers have determined. Then, if you choose a prince worthy to succeedRomulus, the fathers will confirm your choice."" This concession was sopleasing to the people, that, not to be outdone in generosity, they onlyvoted, and required that the senate should determine who should be kingof Rome."Book 1,Chapter 18,"The justice and piety of Numa Pompilius was at that time celebrated.He dwelt at Cures, a city of the Sabines, and was as eminently learnedin all laws human and divine, as any man could be in that age. Theyfalsely represent that Pythagoras of Samos was his instructor inphilosophy, because there appears no other person to refer to. Now it iscertain that this philosopher, in the reign of Servius Tullius, morethan a hundred years after this, held assemblies of young men, whoeagerly imbibed his doctrine, in the most distant part of Italy, aboutMetapontus, Heraclea, and Croton. But [23]from these places, even had heflourished at the same time, what fame of his (extending) to the Sabinescould have aroused any one to a desire of learning, or by whatintercourse of language (could such a thing have been effected)?Besides, how could a single man have safely passed through so manynations differing in language and customs? I presume, therefore, thathis mind was naturally furnished with virtuous dispositions, and that hewas not so much versed in foreign sciences as in the severe and rigiddiscipline of the ancient Sabines, than which class none was in formertimes more strict. The Roman fathers, upon hearing the name of Numa,although they perceived that the scale of power would incline to theSabines if a king were chosen from them, yet none of them ventured toprefer himself, or any other of his party, or any of the citizens orfathers, to that person, but unanimously resolved that the kingdomshould be conferred on Numa Pompilius. Being sent for, just as Romulusbefore the building of the city obtained the throne by an augury, hecommanded the gods to be consulted concerning himself also. Upon this,being conducted into the citadel by an augur, (to which profession thatoffice was made a public one and perpetual by way of honour,) he satdown on a stone facing the south: the augur took his seat on his lefthand with his head covered, holding in his light a crooked wand freefrom knots, which they called _lituus_; then taking a view towards thecity and country, after offering a prayer to the gods, he marked out theregions from east to west, the parts towards the south he called theright, those towards the north, the left; and in front of him he set outin his mind a sign as far as ever his eye could reach. Then havingshifted the lituus into his left hand, placing his right hand on thehead of Numa, he prayed in this manner: ""O father Jupiter, if it is thywill that this Numa Pompilius, whose head I hold, should be king ofRome, I beseech thee to give sure and evident signs of it within thosebounds which I have marked."" Then he stated in set terms the omens whichhe wished to be sent; and on their being sent, Numa was declared kingand came down from the stand."Book 1,Chapter 19,"Having thus obtained the kingdom, he sets about establishing anew,on the principles of laws and morals, the city recently established byviolence and arms. When he saw that their minds, as having been renderedferocious by military life, could not be reconciled to those principlesduring the continuance of wars, considering that a fierce people shouldbe mollified by the disuse of arms, he erected at the foot of Argiletuma temple of Janus, as an index of peace and war; that when open, itmight show the state was engaged in war, and when shut, that all theneighbouring nations were at peace with it. Twice only since the reignof Numa hath this temple been shut; once when T. Manlius was consul, atthe end of the first Punic war; and a second time, which the godsgranted our age to see, by the emperor Augustus C¾sar, after the battleof Actium, peace being established by sea and land. This being shut,after he had secured the friendship of the neighbouring states around byalliance and treaties, all anxiety regarding dangers from abroad beingremoved, lest their minds, which the fear of enemies and militarydiscipline had kept in cheek, should become licentious by tranquillity,he considered, that, first of all, an awe of the gods should beinstilled into them, a principle of the greatest efficacy with amultitude ignorant and uncivilized as in those times. But as it couldnot sink deeply into their minds without some fiction of a miracle, hepretends that he holds nightly interviews with the goddess Egeria; thatby her direction he instituted the sacred rites which would be mostacceptable to the gods, and appointed proper priests for each of thedeities. And, first of all, he divides the year into twelve months,according to the course of the moon; and because the moon does not makeup thirty days in each month, and some days are wanting to the completeyear as constituted by the solstitial revolution, he so portioned it outby inserting intercalary months, that every twenty-fourth year, thelengths of all the intermediate years being completed, the days shouldcorrespond to the same place of the sun (in the heavens) whence they hadset out.[24] He likewise made a distinction of the days[25] intoprofane and sacred, because on some it was likely to be expedient thatno business should be transacted with the people."Book 1,Chapter 20,"Next he turned his attention to the appointment of priests, thoughhe performed many sacred rites himself, especially those which nowbelong to the flamen of Jupiter. But, as he imagined that in a warlikenation there would be more kings resembling Romulus than Numa, and thatthey would go to war in person, he appointed a residentiary priest asflamen to Jupiter, that the sacred functions of the royal office mightnot be neglected, and he distinguished him by a fine robe, and a royalcurule chair. To him he added two other flamines, one for Mars, anotherfor Quirinus. He also selected virgins for Vesta, a priesthood derivedfrom Alba, and not foreign to the family of the founder. That they mightbe constant attendants in the temple, he appointed them salaries out ofthe public treasury; and by enjoining virginity, and other religiousobservances, he made them sacred and venerable. He selected twelve Saliifor Mars Gradivus, and gave them the distinction of an embroideredtunic, and over the tunic a brazen covering for the breast. He commandedthem to carry the celestial shields called [26]Ancilia, and to gothrough the city singing songs, with leaping and solemn dancing. Then hechose out of the number of the fathers Numa Marcius, son of Marcus, aspontiff,[27] and consigned to him an entire system of religious riteswritten out and sealed, (showing) with what victims, upon what days, andin what temples the sacred rites were to be performed; and from whatfunds the money was to be taken for these expenses. He placed allreligious institutions, public and private, under the cognisance of thepontiff to the end that there might be some place where the peopleshould come to consult, lest any confusion in the divine worship mightbe occasioned by neglecting the ceremonies of their own country, andintroducing foreign ones. (He ordained) that the same pontiff shouldinstruct the people not only in the celestial ceremonies, but also in(the manner of performing) funeral solemnities, and of appeasing themanes of the dead; and what prodigies sent by lightning or any otherphenomenon were to be attended to and expiated. To elicit suchknowledge from the divine mind, he dedicated an altar on the Aventine toJupiter [28]Elicius, and consulted the god by auguries as to what(prodigies) should be expiated."Book 1,Chapter 21,"The whole multitude having been diverted from violence and arms tothe considering and adjusting these matters, both their minds had beenengaged in doing something, and the constant watchfulness of the godsnow impressed upon them, as the deity of heaven seemed to interestitself in human concerns, had filled the breasts of all with such piety,that faith and religious obligations governed the state, no less thanfear of the laws and of punishment. And while[29] the people weremoulding themselves after the morals of the king, as their best example,the neighbouring states also, who had formerly thought that it was acamp, not a city, situate in the midst of them to disturb the generalpeace, were brought (to feel) such respect for them that they consideredit impious that a state, wholly occupied in the worship of the gods,should be molested. There was a grove, the middle of which was irrigatedby a spring of running water, issuing from a dark grotto. As Numa wentoften thither alone, under pretence of conferring with the goddess, hededicated the place to the Muses, because their meetings with his wifeEgeria were held there. He also instituted a yearly festival to Faithalone, and commanded the priests to be carried to her temple in anarched chariot drawn by two horses, and to perform the divine servicewith their hands wrapt up to the fingers, intimating that Faith ought tobe protected, and that her seat ought to be sacred even in men's righthands. He instituted many other sacred rites, and dedicated places forperforming them, which the priests call Argei. But the greatest of allhis works was his maintenance of peace, during the whole period of hisreign, no less than of his royal prerogative. Thus two kings insuccession, by different methods, the one by war, the other by peace,aggrandized the state. Romulus reigned thirty-seven years, Numaforty-three: the state was both strong and well versed in the arts ofwar and peace."Book 1,Chapter 22,"Upon the death of Numa, the administration returned again to aninterregnum. After that the people appointed as king, Tullus Hostilius,the grandson of that Hostilius who had made the noble stand against theSabines at the foot of the citadel. The fathers confirmed the choice. Hewas not only unlike the preceding king, but was even of a more warlikedisposition than Romulus. Both his youth and strength, and the renown ofhis grandfather, stimulated his ambition. Thinking therefore that thestate was becoming languid through quiet, he every where sought forpretexts for stirring up war. It happened that some Roman and Albanpeasants had mutually plundered each other's lands. C. Cluilius at thattime governed Alba. From both sides ambassadors were sent almost at thesame time, to demand restitution. Tullus ordered his to attend tonothing before their instructions. He knew well that the Alban wouldrefuse, and that so war might be proclaimed on just grounds. Theircommission was executed more remissly by the Albans. For beingcourteously and kindly entertained by Tullus, they politely availthemselves of the king's hospitality. Meanwhile the Romans had both beenfirst in demanding restitution, and, upon the refusal of the Albans, hadproclaimed war after an interval of thirty days: of this they giveTullus notice. Upon this he granted the Alban ambassadors an opportunityof stating what they came to demand. They, ignorant of all, waste sometime in making apologies: ""That it was with the utmost reluctance theyshould say any thing which was not pleasing to Tullus; but they werecompelled by their orders. That they had come to demand restitution; andif this be not made, they were commanded to declare war."" To this Tullusmade answer, ""Go tell your king, that the king of the Romans takes thegods to witness, which of the two nations hath with contempt firstdismissed the ambassadors demanding restitution, that on it they mayvisit all the calamities of this war."" The Albans carry home thesetidings."Book 1,Chapter 23,"War was prepared for on both sides with the utmost vigour, very liketo a civil war, in a manner between parents and children: both beingTrojan offspring; for from Troy came Lavinium, from Lavinium Alba, andthe Romans were descended from the race of Alban kings. But the resultof the war rendered the quarrel less distressing, for they never came toany action; and, when the houses only of one of the cities had beendemolished, the two states were incorporated into one. The Albans firstmade an irruption into the Roman territories with a large army. Theypitch their camp not above five miles from the city, and surround itwith a trench, which, for several ages, was called the Cluilian trench,from the name of the general, till, in process of time, the name,together with the thing itself, were both forgotten. In that campCluilius, the Alban king, dies; the Albans create Mettus[30] Fuffetiusdictator. In the mean time, Tullus being in high spirits, especially onthe death of the king, and giving out that the supreme power of thegods, having begun at the head, would take vengeance on the whole Albannation for this impious war, having passed the enemy's camp in thenight-time, marches with a hostile army into the Alban territory. Thiscircumstance drew out Mettus from his camp likewise; he leads his forcesas near as he can to the enemy; from thence he commands a herald,despatched by him, to tell Tullus that a conference was expedient beforethey came to an engagement; and that if he would give him a meeting, hewas certain he should adduce matters which concerned the interest ofRome not less than that of Alba. Tullus not slighting the proposal,though the advances made were of little avail, draws out his men inorder of battle; the Albans on their part come out also. As both armiesstood in battle-array, the chiefs, with a few of the principal officers,advance into the middle between them. Then the Alban commences thus:[31]""That injuries and the non-restitution of property according totreaty, when demanded, were the cause of this war, methinks I both heardour King Cluilius (assert), and I doubt not, Tullus, but that you statethe same thing. But if the truth is to be told, rather than that whichis plausible, the desire of dominion stimulates two kindred andneighbouring states to arms. Nor do I take upon myself to determinewhether rightly or wrongly: be that his consideration who commenced thewar. The Albans have made me their leader for carrying on the war. Ofthis, Tullus, I would wish to warn you; how powerful the Etruscan stateis around us, and round you particularly, you know better (than we),inasmuch as you are nearer them. They are very powerful by land,extremely so by sea. Recollect that, when you shall give the signal forbattle, these two armies will presently be a spectacle to them; and theymay fall on us wearied and exhausted, victor and vanquished together.Therefore, in the name of heaven, since, not content with certainliberty, we are incurring the dubious risk of sovereignty and slavery,let us adopt some method, whereby, without much loss, without much bloodof either nation, it may be decided which shall rule the other.""--Theproposal is not displeasing to Tullus, though both from the natural bentof his mind, as also from the hope of victory, he was rather inclined toviolence. After some consideration, a plan is adopted on both sides, forwhich Fortune herself afforded the materials."Book 1,Chapter 24,"It happened that there were in each of the two armies threebrothers[32] born at one birth, unequal neither in age nor strength.That they were called Horatii and Curiatii is certain enough; nor isthere any circumstance of antiquity more celebrated; yet in a matter sowell ascertained, a doubt remains concerning their names, to whichnation the Horatii and to which the Curiatii belonged. Authors claimthem for both sides; yet I find more who call the Horatii Romans. Myinclination leads me to follow them. The kings confer with the threebrothers, that they should fight with their swords each in defence oftheir respective country; (assuring them) that dominion would be on thatside on which victory should be. No objection is made; time and placeare agreed on. Before they engaged, a compact is entered into betweenthe Romans and Albans on these conditions, that the state whosechampions should come off victorious in that combat, should rule theother state without further dispute. Different treaties are made ondifferent terms, but they are all concluded in the same general method.We have heard that it was then concluded as follows, nor is there a moreancient record of any treaty. A herald asked king Tullus thus, ""Do youcommand me, O king, to conclude a treaty with the pater patratus of theAlban people?"" After the king had given command, he said, ""I demandvervain of thee, O king."" To which the king replied, ""Take some that ispure."" The herald brought a pure blade of grass from the citadel; againhe asked the king thus, ""Dost thou, O king, appoint me the royaldelegate of the Roman people, the Quirites? _including_ my vessels andattendants?"" The king answered, ""That which may be done withoutdetriment to me and to the Roman people, the Quirites, I do."" The heraldwas M. Valerius, who appointed Sp. Fusius pater patratus, touching hishead and hair with the vervain. The pater patratus is appointed ""adjusjurandum patrandum,"" that is, to ratify the treaty; and he goesthrough it in a great many words, which, being expressed in a long setform, it is not worth while repeating. After setting forth theconditions, he says, ""Hear, O Jupiter; hear, O pater patratus of theAlban people, and ye, Alban people, hear. As those (conditions), fromfirst to last, have been recited openly from those tablets or waxwithout wicked fraud, and as they have been most correctly understoodhere this day, from those conditions the Roman people will not be thefirst to swerve. If they first swerve by public concert, by wickedfraud, on that day do thou, O Jupiter, so strike the Roman people, as Ishall here this day strike this swine; and do thou strike them so muchthe more, as thou art more able and more powerful."" When he said this,he struck the swine with a flint stone. The Albans likewise went throughtheir own form and oath by their own dictator and priests."Book 1,Chapter 25,"The treaty being concluded, the twin-brothers, as had been agreed,take arms. Whilst their respective friends exhortingly reminded eachparty ""that their country's gods, their country and parents, all theircountrymen both at home and in the army, had their eyes then fixed ontheir arms, on their hands; naturally brave, and animated by theexhortations of their friends, they advance into the midst between thetwo lines."" The two armies sat down before their respective camps, freerather from present danger than from anxiety: for the sovereign powerwas at stake, depending on the valour and fortune of so few.Accordingly, therefore, eager and anxious, they have their attentionintensely riveted on a spectacle far from pleasing. The signal is given:and the three youths on each side, as if in battle-array, rush to thecharge with determined fury, bearing in their breasts the spirits ofmighty armies: nor do the one or the other regard their personal danger;the public dominion or slavery is present to their mind, and thefortune[33] of their country, which was ever after destined to be suchas they should now establish it. As soon as their arms clashed on thefirst encounter, and their burnished swords glittered, great horrorstrikes the spectators; and, hope inclining to neither side, their voiceand breath were suspended. Then having engaged hand to hand, when notonly the movements of their bodies, and the rapid brandishings of theirarms and weapons, but wounds also and blood were seen, two of the Romansfell lifeless, one upon the other, the three Albans being wounded. Andwhen the Alban army raised a shout of joy at their fall, hope entirely,anxiety however not yet, deserted the Roman legions, alarmed for the lotof the one, whom the three Curiatii surrounded. He happened to beunhurt, so that, though alone he was by no means a match for them alltogether, yet he was confident against each singly. In order thereforeto separate their attack, he takes to flight, presuming that they wouldpursue him with such swiftness as the wounded state of his body wouldsuffer each. He had now fled a considerable distance from the placewhere they had fought, when, looking behind, he perceives them pursuinghim at great intervals from each other; and that one of them was not farfrom him. On him he turned round with great fury. And whilst the Albanarmy shouts out to the Curiatii to succour their brother, Horatius,victorious in having slain his antagonist, was now proceeding to asecond attack. Then the Romans encourage their champion with a shoutsuch as is usually (given) by persons cheering in consequence ofunexpected success: he also hastens to put an end to the combat.Wherefore before the other, who was not far off, could come up hedespatches the second Curiatius also. And now, the combat being broughtto an equality of numbers, one on each side remained, but they wereequal neither in hope nor in strength. The one his body untouched by aweapon, and a double victory made courageous for a third contest: theother dragging along his body exhausted from the wound, exhausted fromrunning, and dispirited by the slaughter of his brethren before hiseyes, presents himself to his victorious antagonist. Nor was that afight. The Roman, exulting, says, ""Two I have offered to the shades ofmy brothers: the third I will offer to the cause of this war, that theRoman may rule over the Alban."" He thrusts his sword down into histhroat, whilst faintly sustaining the weight of his armour: he stripshim as he lies prostrate. The Romans receive Horatius with triumph andcongratulation; with so much the greater joy, as success had followed soclose on fear. They then turn to the burial of their friends withdispositions by no means alike; for the one side was elated with (theacquisition of) empire, the other subjected to foreign jurisdiction:their sepulchres are still extant in the place where each fell; the twoRoman ones in one place nearer to Alba, the three Alban ones towardsRome; but distant in situation from each other, and just as theyfought."Book 1,Chapter 26,"Before they parted from thence, when Mettus, in conformity to thetreaty which had been concluded, asked what orders he had to give,Tullus orders him to keep the youth in arms, that he designed to employthem, if a war should break out with the Veientes. After this botharmies returned to their homes. Horatius marched foremost, carryingbefore him the spoils of the three brothers: his sister, a maiden whohad been betrothed to one of the Curiatii, met him before the gateCapena: and having recognized her lover's military robe, which sheherself had wrought, on her brother's shoulders, she tore her hair, andwith bitter wailings called by name on her deceased lover. The sister'slamentations in the midst of his own victory, and of such great publicrejoicings, raised the indignation of the excited youth. Havingtherefore drawn his sword, he run the damsel through the body, at thesame time chiding her in these words: ""Go hence, with thy unseasonablelove to thy spouse, forgetful of thy dead brothers, and of him whosurvives, forgetful of thy native country. So perish every Roman womanwho shall mourn an enemy."" This action seemed shocking to the fathersand to the people; but his recent services outweighed its guilt.Nevertheless he was carried before the king for judgment. The king, thathe himself might not be the author of a decision so melancholy, and sodisagreeable to the people, or of the punishment consequent on thatdecision, having summoned an assembly of the people, says, ""I appoint,according to law, duumvirs to pass sentence on Horatius for[35]treason."" The law was of dreadful import. [36]""Let the duumvirs passsentence for treason. If he appeal from the duumvirs, let him contend byappeal; if they shall gain the cause,[37] cover his head; hang him by arope from a gallows; scourge him either within the pomÏrium orwithout the pomÏrium."" When the duumvirs appointed by this law, whodid not consider that, according to the law, they could [38]acquit evenan innocent person, had found him guilty; one of them says, ""P.Horatius, I judge thee guilty of treason. Go, lictor, bind his hands.""The lictor had approached him, and was fixing the rope. Then Horatius,by the advice of Tullus,[39] a favourable interpreter of the law, says,""I appeal."" Accordingly the matter was contested by appeal to thepeople. On that trial persons were much affected, especially by P.Horatius the father declaring, that he considered his daughterdeservedly slain; were it not so, that he would by his authority as afather have inflicted punishment on his son.[40] He then entreated thatthey would not render childless him whom but a little while ago they hadbeheld with a fine progeny. During these words the old man, havingembraced the youth, pointing to the spoils of the Curiatii fixed up inthat place which is now called Pila Horatia, ""Romans,"" said he, ""can youbear to see bound beneath a gallows amidst scourges and tortures, himwhom you just now beheld marching decorated (with spoils) and exultingin victory; a sight so shocking as the eyes even of the Albans couldscarcely endure. Go, lictor, bind those hands, which but a little whilesince, being armed, established sovereignty for the Roman people. Go,cover the head of the liberator of this city; hang him on the gallows;scourge him, either within the pomÏrium, so it be only amid thosejavelins and spoils of the enemy; or without the pomÏrium, only amidthe graves of the Curiatii. For whither can you bring this youth, wherehis own glories must not redeem him from such ignominy of punishment?""The people could not withstand the tears of the father, or theresolution of the son, so undaunted in every danger; and acquitted himmore through admiration of his bravery, than for the justice of hiscause. But that so notorious a murder might be atoned for by someexpiation, the father was commanded to make satisfaction for the son atthe public charge. He, having offered certain expiatory sacrifices,which were ever after continued in the Horatian family, and laid a beamacross the street, made his son pass under it as under a yoke, with hishead covered. This remains even to this day, being constantly repairedat the expense of the public; they call it Sororium Tigillum. A tomb ofsquare stone was erected to Horatia in the place where she was stabbedand fell."Book 1,Chapter 27,"Nor did the peace with Alba continue long. The dissatisfaction ofthe populace, because the fortune of the state had been hazarded onthree soldiers, perverted the weak mind of the dictator; and becausehonourable measures had not turned out well, he began to conciliatetheir affections by perfidious means. Accordingly, as one formerlyseeking peace in war, so now seeking war in peace, because he perceivedthat his own state possessed more courage than strength, he stirs upother nations to make war openly and by proclamation:[41] for his ownpeople he reserves treachery under the mask of alliance. The Fidenates,a Roman colony, having gained over the Veientes as partisans in theconfederacy, are instigated to declare war and take up arms under acompact of desertion on the part of the Albans. When Fiden¾ had openly[42]revolted, Tullus, after summoning Mettus and his army from Alba,marches against the enemy. When he crossed the Anio, he pitches his campat the [43]conflux of the rivers. Between that place and Fiden¾, thearmy of the Veientes had crossed the Tiber. These, in line of battle,occupied the right wing near the river; the Fidenates are posted on theleft nearer the mountains. Tullus stations his own men opposite theVeientian foe; the Albans he opposes to the legion of the Fidenates. TheAlban had not more courage than fidelity. Neither daring therefore tokeep his ground, nor to desert openly, he files off slowly to themountains. After this, when he supposed he had gone far enough, he[44]halts his entire army; and being still irresolute in mind, in orderto waste time, he opens his ranks. His design was, to turn his forces tothat side to which fortune should give success. At first the Romans whostood nearest were astonished, when they perceived their flanks wereuncovered by the departure of their allies; then a horseman in fullgallop announces to the king that the Albans were moving off. Tullus, inthis perilous juncture, vowed twelve Salii, and temples to Paleness andPanic. Rebuking the horseman in a loud voice, so that the enemy mighthear him, he orders him to return to the fight, ""that there was nooccasion for alarm; that by his order the Alban army was marching roundto fall on the unprotected rear of the Fidenates."" He likewise commandshim to order the cavalry to raise their spears aloft; this expedientintercepted from a great part of the Roman infantry the view of theAlban army retreating. Those who saw it, believing what they had heardthe king say, fought with the greater ardour. The alarm is nowtransferred to the enemy; they had both heard what had been pronouncedso audibly, and a great part of the Fidenates, as having been joined ascolonists to the Romans, understood Latin. Therefore, that they mightnot be intercepted from the town by a sudden descent of the Albans fromthe hills, they take to flight. Tullus presses forward, and havingrouted the wing of the Fidenates, returned with greater fury against theVeientes, disheartened by the panic of the others: nor did they sustainhis charge; but the river, opposed to them behind, prevented aprecipitate flight. Whither when their flight led, some, shamefullythrowing down their arms, rushed blindly into the river; others, whilethey linger on the banks, doubting whether to fly or fight, wereoverpowered. Never before had the Romans a more desperate battle."Book 1,Chapter 28,"Then the Alban army, that had been spectators of the fight, wasmarched down into the plains. Mettus congratulates Tullus on his defeatof the enemy; Tullus on his part addresses Mettus with great civility.He orders the Albans to unite their camp with the Romans, which heprayed might prove beneficial to both; and prepares a sacrifice ofpurification for the next day. As soon as it was light, all things beingin readiness, according to custom, he commands both armies to besummoned to an assembly. The heralds,[45] beginning at the outside,summoned the Albans first. They, struck[46] too with the novelty of thething, in order to hear the Roman king harangue, crowded next to him.The Roman legions, under arms, by concert surrounded them; a charge hadbeen given to the centurions to execute their orders without delay. ThenTullus begins as follows: ""Romans, if ever before at any other time inany war there was (an occasion) on which you should return thanks, firstto the immortal gods, next to your own valour, that occasion wasyesterday's battle. For the contest was not more with enemies than withthe treachery and perfidy of allies, a contest which is more serious andmore dangerous. For that a false opinion may not influence you, theAlbans retired to the mountains without my orders, nor was that mycommand, but a stratagem and the pretence of a command: that so yourattention might not be drawn away from the fight, you being kept inignorance that you were deserted, and that terror and dismay might bestruck into the enemy, conceiving themselves to be surrounded on therear. Nor does that guilt, which I now state, extend to all the Albans.They followed their leader; as you too would have done, if I had wishedmy army to make a move to any other point from thence. Mettus there isthe leader of that march, the same Mettus is the contriver of this war;Mettus is the violator of the treaty between Rome and Alba. Let anotherhereafter attempt the like conduct, unless I now make of him a signalexample to mankind."" The centurions in arms stand round Mettus, and theking proceeds with the rest as he had commenced: ""It is my intention,and may it prove fortunate, auspicious, and happy to the Roman people,to myself, and to you, O Albans, to transplant all the inhabitants ofAlba to Rome: to grant your people the rights of citizenship, and toadmit your nobles into the rank of senators: to make one city, onerepublic; that as the Alban state was formerly divided from one peopleinto two, so it may now return into one."" On hearing this the Albanyouth, unarmed, surrounded by armed men, however divided in theirsentiments, yet restrained by the common apprehension, continue silent.Then Tullus proceeded: ""If, Mettus Fuffetius, you were capable oflearning fidelity, and how to observe treaties, that lesson would havebeen taught you by me, while still alive. Now, since your disposition isincurable, do you at least by your punishment teach mankind to considerthose things sacred which have been violated by you. As therefore alittle while since you kept your mind divided between the interest ofFiden¾ and of Rome, so shall you now surrender your body to be tornasunder in different directions."" Upon this, two chariots drawn by fourhorses being brought, he ties Mettus extended at full length to theircarriages: then the horses were driven on in different directions,carrying off the mangled body on each carriage, where the limbs had beenfastened by the cords. All turned away their eyes from so shocking aspectacle. That was the first and last instance of a punishment amongthe Romans regardless of the laws of humanity. In other cases we mayboast that no nation whatever adopted milder forms of punishment."Book 1,Chapter 29,"During these occurrences the cavalry had been despatched onward toAlba to remove the multitude to Rome. The legions were next led thitherto demolish the city. When they entered the gates, there was not indeedthat tumult nor panic, such as usually takes place with captured citieswhen the gates being burst open, or the walls levelled by the ram, orthe citadel taken by assault, the shouts of the enemy and rush of armedmen through the city throws every thing into confusion by fire andsword: but gloomy silence and speechless sorrow so absorbed the minds ofall, that, through fear, forgetting what they should leave behind, whatthey should take with them, all concert failing them, and frequentlymaking inquiries of each other, they now stood at their thresholds, nowwandering about they strayed through their houses, doomed to see themfor that the last time. But as soon as the shouts of the horsemencommanding them to depart now urged them on, the crashing of thedwellings which were being demolished, was now heard in the remotestparts of the city, and the dust, rising in distant places, had filledevery quarter as with a cloud spread over them; hastily snatching upwhatever each of them could, whilst they went forth leaving behind themtheir guardian deity and household gods, and the homes in which each hadbeen born and brought up, a continued train of emigrants soon filled theways, and the sight of others through mutual commiseration renewed theirtears, and piteous cries too were heard, of the women more especially,when they passed by their revered temples now beset with armed men, andleft their gods as it were in captivity. After the Albans had evacuatedthe town, the Roman soldiery level all the public and private edificesindiscriminately to the ground, and one short hour consigned todemolition and ruin the work of four hundred years, during which Albahad stood. The temples of the gods, however, for such had been theorders given by the king, were spared."Book 1,Chapter 30,"In the mean time Rome increases by the demolition of Alba. Thenumber of citizens is doubled. The CÏlian mount is added to the city,and in order that it might be inhabited more populously, Tullus selectsthat situation for his palace and there took up his abode. The leadingpersons among the Albans he enrols among the patricians, that thatbranch of the state also might increase, the Julii, Servilii, Quinctii,Geganii, Curiatii, ClÏlii; and as a consecrated place of meeting forthe order augmented by him he built a senate-house, which was calledHostilia even down to the age of our fathers. And that every rank mightacquire some additional strength from the new people, he formed tentroops of horsemen from among the Albans: he likewise recruited the old,and raised new legions from the same source. Confiding in this increaseof strength, Tullus declares war against the Sabines, a nation at thattime the most powerful, next to the Etrurians, in men and in arms.Injuries had been done on both sides, and restitution demanded in vain.Tullus complained that some Roman merchants had been seized in an openmarket near the temple of Feronia; the Sabines, that some of theirpeople had taken refuge in the asylum, and were detained at Rome. Thesewere assigned as the causes of the war. The Sabines, holding inrecollection both that a portion of their strength had been fixed atRome by Tatius, and that the Roman power had also been lately increasedby the accession of the Alban people, began, on their part, to lookaround for foreign aid. Etruria was in their neighbourhood; of theEtrurians the Veientes were the nearest. From thence they drew somevolunteers, their minds being stirred up to a revolt, chiefly inconsequence of the rankling animosities from (former) wars. And pay alsohad its weight with some stragglers belonging to the indigentpopulation. They were assisted by no aid from the government, and thefaith of the truce stipulated with Romulus was strictly observed by theVeientes (for with respect to the others it is less surprising). Whilethey were preparing for war with the utmost vigour, and the matterseemed to turn on this, which should first commence hostilities, Tullusfirst passes into the Sabine territory. A desperate battle ensued at thewood called Malitiosa,[47] in which the Roman army was far superior,both by the strength of their foot, and also by the recent augmentationof their cavalry. The Sabine ranks were thrown into disorder by a suddencharge of the cavalry, nor could either the fight be afterwardsrestored, or a retreat accomplished without great slaughter."Book 1,Chapter 31,"After the defeat of the Sabines, when the government of Tullus andthe whole Roman state was in high renown, and in a very flourishingcondition, word was brought to the king and senators, that it rainedstones on the Alban Mount. As this could scarcely be credited, onpersons being sent to inquire into the prodigy, a thick shower of stonesfell from heaven in their sight, just as when hail collected into ballsis pelted down to the earth by the winds. Besides, they imagined thatthey heard a loud voice from the grove on the summit of the hill,requiring the Albans to perform their religious service according to therites of their native country, which they had consigned to oblivion, asif their gods had been abandoned together with their country; and theyhad either adopted the religion of Rome, or, as may happen, enraged attheir evil destiny, had renounced altogether the worship of the gods. Afestival of nine days was instituted publicly by the Romans also onaccount of the same prodigy, either in obedience to the heavenly voicesent from the Alban mount, (for that too is stated,) or by the advice ofthe aruspices. Certain it is, it continued a solemn observance, thatwhenever the same prodigy was announced, a festival for nine days wasobserved. Not long after, they were afflicted with a pestilence; andthough from this there arose an aversion to military service, yet norespite from arms was granted by this warlike king, who considered thatthe bodies of the young men were even more healthy abroad than at home,until he himself also was seized with a lingering disease. Then,together with his body, those fierce spirits became so broken, that he,who formerly considered nothing less worthy of a king than to devote hismind to religion, suddenly became a slave to every form of superstition,important and trifling, and filled the people's minds also withreligious scruples. The generality of persons, now wishing to recur tothat state of things which had existed under king Numa, thought that theonly relief left for their sickly bodies was, if peace and pardon couldbe obtained from the gods. They say that the king himself, turning overthe commentaries of Numa, after he had found therein that certainsacrifices of a secret and solemn nature had been performed to JupiterElicius, shut himself up and set about the performance of thissolemnity; but that that rite was not duly undertaken or conducted, andthat not only no appearance of heavenly notification was presented tohim, but that he was struck with lightning and burnt to ashes, togetherwith his house, through the anger of Jupiter, exasperated at theimpropriety of the ceremony. Tullus reigned two-and-thirty years withgreat military renown."Book 1,Chapter 32,"On the death of Tullus the government devolved once more upon thesenate, and they nominated an interrex; and on his holding the comitia,the people elected Ancus Marcius king. The fathers confirmed theelection. Ancus Marcius was the grandson of king Numa Pompilius by hisdaughter. As soon as he ascended the throne, reflecting on the renown ofhis grandfather, and that the late reign, glorious in every otherrespect, in one particular had not been sufficiently prosperous, therites of religion having either been utterly neglected, or improperlyperformed; deeming it of the highest importance to perform the publicceremonies of religion as they had been instituted by Numa, he ordersthe pontiff, after he had transcribed them all from the king'scommentaries on white tables, to expose them to public view. Hence, bothhis own subjects, desirous of peace, and the neighbouring nations,entertained a hope that the king would conform to the conduct andinstitutions of his grandfather. Accordingly the Latins, with whom atreaty had been concluded in the reign of Tullus, assumed new courage;and after they had made an incursion upon the Roman lands, return acontemptuous answer to the Romans on their demanding restitution,supposing that the Roman king would spend his reign in indolence amongchapels and altars. The genius of Ancus was of a middle kind, partakingboth of that of Numa and of Romulus; and, besides that, he thought thatpeace was more necessary in his grandfather's reign, considering thepeople were but recent as well as uncivilized, he also (considered) thathe could not, without injury, preserve the tranquillity which had fallento his lot; that his patience was tried, and being tried, was nowdespised; and that the times were more suited to a king Tullus than to aNuma. In order, however, that as Numa had instituted religious rites inpeace, ceremonies relating to war might be transmitted by him, and thatwars might not only be waged, but proclaimed also according to somerite, he borrowed from an ancient nation, the ®quicolae, the form whichthe heralds still preserve, according to which restitution is demanded.The ambassador, when he comes to the frontiers of the people from whomsatisfaction is demanded, having his head covered with a fillet, (thefillet is of wool,) says, ""Hear, O Jupiter, hear, ye confines, (namingthe nation they belong to,) let Justice hear. I am a public messenger ofthe Roman people; I come justly and religiously deputed, and let mywords gain credit."" He then makes his demands; afterwards he makes asolemn appeal to Jupiter, ""If I unjustly or impiously demand thosepersons and those goods to be given up to me, the messenger of the Romanpeople, then never permit me to enjoy my native country."" These words herepeats when he passes over the frontiers; the same to the first man hemeets; the same on entering the gate; the same on entering the forum,some few words in the form of the declaration and oath being changed. Ifthe persons whom he demands are not delivered up, on the expiration ofthirty-three days, for so many are enjoined by the rule, he declareswar, thus: ""Hear, Jupiter, and thou, Juno, Romulus, and all yecelestial, terrestrial, and infernal gods, give ear! I call you towitness, that this nation (naming it) is unjust, and does not act withequity; but we will consult the fathers in our own country concerningthese matters, and by what means we may obtain our right."" After thatthe messenger returns to Rome to consult: the king immediately used toconsult the fathers almost in the following words: ""Concerning suchmatters, differences, and quarrels, as the pater patratus of the Romanpeople, the Quirites, has conferred with the pater patratus of theancient Latins, and with the ancient Latin people, which matters oughtto be given up, performed, discharged, which matters they have neithergiven up, performed, nor discharged, declare,"" says he to him, whoseopinion he first asked, ""what think you?"" Then he said, ""I think thatthey should be demanded by a just and regularly declared war, thereforeI consent, and vote for it."" Then the others were asked in order, andwhen the majority of those present agreed in the same opinion, the warwas resolved on. It was customary for the fecialis to carry in his handa javelin pointed with steel, or burnt at the end and dipped in blood,to the confines of the enemy's country, and in presence of at leastthree grown-up persons, to say, ""Forasmuch as the states of the ancientLatins, and the ancient Latin people, have offended against the Romanpeople, the Quirites, forasmuch as the Roman people, the Quirites, haveordered that there should be war with the ancient Latins, and the senateof the Roman people, the Quirites, have given their opinion, consented,and voted that war should be made with the ancient Latins, on thisaccount I and the Roman people declare and make war on the states of theancient Latins, and on the ancient Latin people."" After he had saidthat, he threw the spear within their confines. After this mannerrestitution was demanded from the Latins at that time, and warproclaimed: and that usage posterity have adopted."Book 1,Chapter 33,"Ancus, having committed the care of sacred things to the flaminesand other priests, set out with a new army, which he had levied, andtook Politorium, a city of the Latins, by storm; and following theexample of former kings, who had increased the Roman state by takingenemies into the number of the citizens, he transplanted all the peopleto Rome. And since the Sabines occupied the Capitol and citadel, and theAlbans the CÏlian mount around the Palatium, the residence of the oldRomans, the Aventine was assigned to the new people; not long after, onTelleni and Ficana being taken, new citizens were added in the samequarter. After this Politorium was taken a second time by force of arms,because the ancient Latins had taken possession of it when vacated. Thiswas the cause of the Romans demolishing that city, that it might notever after serve as a receptacle to the enemy. At last, the whole warwith the Latins being concentrated in Medullia, they fought there withvarious fortune, sometimes the one and sometimes the other gaining thevictory; for the town was both well fortified by works, and strengthenedby a strong garrison, and the Latins, having pitched their camp in theopen fields, had several times fought the Romans in close engagement. Atlast Ancus, making an effort with all his forces, obtained a completevictory over them in a pitched battle, and having got a considerablebooty, returned thence to Rome; many thousands of the Latins being thenalso admitted into the city, to whom, in order that the Aventine mightbe joined to the Palatium, a settlement was assigned near the temple ofMurcia. The Janiculum was likewise added, not for want of room, but lestat any time it should become a lodgment for the enemy. It was determinedto join it to the city, not only by a wall, but likewise, for the sakeof the convenience of passage, by a wooden bridge, then for the firsttime built across the Tiber. The Fossa Quiritium, no inconsiderabledefence against the easy access to the city from the low grounds, is thework of king Ancus. The state being augmented by such great accessions,seeing that, amid such a multitude of persons, the distinction of rightand wrong being as yet confounded, clandestine crimes were committed, aprison is built in the heart of the city, overlooking the forum, tointimidate the growing licentiousness. And not only was the cityincreased under this king, but the territory also and the boundaries.The M¾sian forest was taken from the Veientes, the Roman dominion wasextended as far as the sea, and the city of Ostia built at the mouth ofthe Tiber; salt-pits were formed around it, and, in consequence of thedistinguished success achieved in war, the temple of Jupiter Feretriuswas enlarged."Book 1,Chapter 34,"In the reign of Ancus, Lucumo, a rich and enterprising man, came tosettle at Rome, prompted chiefly by the desire and hope of obtaininggreat preferment there, which he had no means of attaining at Tarquinii(for there also he was descended from an alien stock). He was the son ofDemaratus, a Corinthian, who, flying his country for sedition, hadhappened to settle at Tarquinii, and having married a wife there, hadtwo sons by her. Their names were [48]Lucumo and Aruns. Lucumo survivedhis father, and became heir to all his property. Aruns died before hisfather, leaving a wife pregnant. The father did not long survive theson, and as he, not knowing that his daughter-in-law was pregnant, diedwithout taking any notice of his grandchild in his will, to the boy thatwas born after the death of his grandfather, without having any share inhis fortune, the name of Egerius was given on account of his poverty.And when his wealth already inspired Lucumo, on the other hand, the heirof all his father's wealth, with elevated notions, Tanaquil, whom hemarried, further increased such feeling, she being descended from a veryhigh family, and one who would not readily brook the condition intowhich she had married to be inferior to that in which she had been born.As the Etrurians despised Lucumo, because sprung from a foreign exile,she could not bear the affront, and regardless of the innate love of hernative country, provided she might see her husband advanced to honours,she formed the determination to leave Tarquinii. Rome seemedparticularly suited for her purpose. In this state, lately founded,where all nobility is recent and the result of merit, there would beroom for her husband, a man of courage and activity. Tatius a Sabine hadbeen king of Rome: Numa had been sent for from Cures to reign there:Ancus was sprung from a Sabine mother, and rested his nobility on thesingle statue of Numa. She easily persuades him, as being ambitious ofhonours, and one to whom Tarquinii was his country only on the mother'sside. Accordingly, removing their effects they set out together forRome. They happened to have reached the Janiculum; there, as he sat inthe chariot with his wife, an eagle, suspended on her wings, gentlystooping, takes off his cap, and flying round the chariot with loudscreams, as if she had been sent from heaven for the very purpose,orderly replaced it on his head, and then flew aloft. Tanaquil is saidto have received this omen with great joy, being a woman well skilled,as the Etrurians generally are, in celestial prodigies, and embracingher husband, bids him hope for high and elevated fortune: that such birdhad come from such a quarter of the heavens, and the messenger of such agod: that it had exhibited the omen around the highest part of man: thatit had lifted the ornament placed on the head of man, to restore it tothe same, by direction of the gods. Carrying with them these hopes andthoughts, they entered the city, and having purchased a house there,they gave out the name of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus. His being astranger and very rich, caused him to be taken notice of by the Romans.He also promoted his own good fortune by his affable address, by thecourteousness of his invitations, and by conciliating those whom hecould by acts of kindness; until a report of him reached even to thepalace; and by paying court to the king with politeness and address, hein a short time so improved the acquaintance to the footing of intimatefriendship, that he was present at all public and private deliberations,foreign and domestic; and being now tried in every trust, he was atlength, by the king's will, appointed guardian to his children."Book 1,Chapter 35,"Ancus reigned twenty-four years, equal to any of the former kingsboth in the arts and renown of war and peace. His sons were now nighthe age of puberty, for this reason Tarquin was more urgent that theassembly for the election of a king should be held as soon as possible.The assembly being proclaimed, he sent away the boys to hunt towards thetime of their meeting. He is said to have been the first who earnestlysued for the crown, and to have made a set speech for the purpose ofgaining the affections of the people: _he said_ ""that he did not aim atany thing unprecedented; for that he was not the first foreigner, (athing at which any one might feel indignation or surprise,) but thethird who aspired to the sovereignty of Rome. That Tatius not only frombeing an alien, but even an enemy, was made king: that Numa,unacquainted with the city, and without soliciting it, had beenvoluntarily invited by them to the throne. That he, as soon as he washis own master, had come to Rome with his wife and whole fortune, andhad there spent a greater part of that age, in which men are employed incivil offices, than he had in his native country: that he had both inpeace and war thoroughly learned the Roman laws and religious customs,under a master not to be objected to, king Ancus himself; that he hadvied with all in duty and loyalty to his prince, and even with the kinghimself in his bounty to others."" While he was recounting theseundoubted facts, the people by a great majority elected him king. Thesame ambition which had prompted Tarquin, in other respects an excellentman, to aspire to the crown, followed him whilst on the throne. Andbeing no less mindful of strengthening his own power, than of increasingthat of the commonwealth, he elected a hundred into the fathers, whofrom that time were called Minorum Gentium, _i. e._ of the youngerfamilies: a party hearty in the king's cause, by whose favour they hadgot into the senate. The first war he waged was with the Latins, fromwhom he took the town of Apiol¾ by storm, and having brought back thencemore booty than the character of the war would lead one to expect, hecelebrated games with more cost and magnificence than former kings. Theplace for the circus, which is now called Maximus, was then first markedout, and spaces were parted off for the senators and knights, where theymight each erect seats for themselves: they were called fori (benches).They viewed the games from scaffolding which supported seats twelvefeet high from the ground. The show took place; horses and boxers weresent for, chiefly from Etruria. These solemn games afterwards continuedannual, being variously called the Roman and Great (games). By the sameking also spaces round the forum were portioned off for privateindividuals to build on; porticoes and shops were erected."Book 1,Chapter 36,"He was also preparing to surround the city with a stone wall, when aSabine war obstructed his designs. The matter was so sudden, that theenemy had passed the Anio before the Roman army could meet and stopthem; great alarm therefore was produced at Rome. And at first theyfought with dubious success, but with great slaughter on both sides.After this, the enemy's forces being led back into their camp, and theRomans getting time to make new levies for the war, Tarquin, thinkingthat the weakness of his army lay in the want of horse, determined toadd other centuries to the Ramnenses, the Titienses, and Luceres whichRomulus had appointed, and to leave them distinguished by his own name.Because Romulus had done this by augury, Attus Navius, at that time acelebrated soothsayer, insisted that no alteration or new appointment ofthat kind could be made, unless the birds approved of it. The king,enraged at this, and, as it is related, ridiculing the art, said, ""Come,thou diviner, tell me, whether what I am thinking on can be done ornot?"" When he had tried the matter by divination, he affirmed itcertainly could. ""But I was thinking,"" says he, ""whether you could cutasunder this whetstone with a razor. Take it, and perform what thy birdsportend may be done."" Upon this, as they say, he immediately cut thewhetstone in two. A statue of Attus, with his head veiled, was erectedin the comitium, upon the very steps on the left of the senate-house, onthe spot where the transaction occurred. They say that the whetstonealso was deposited in the same place, that it might remain a monument ofthat miracle to posterity. There certainly accrued so much honour toaugury and the college of augurs, that nothing was undertaken either inpeace or war without taking the auspices. Assemblies of the people, thesummoning of armies, and affairs of the greatest importance were putoff, when the birds would not allow of them. Nor did Tarquin then makeany other alteration in the centuries of horse, except doubling thenumber of men in each of these corps, so that the three centuriesconsisted of one thousand eight hundred knights. Those that were addedwere called ""the younger,"" but by the same names with the former; which,now that they have been doubled, they call six centuries."Book 1,Chapter 37,"This part of his forces being augmented, a second battle is foughtwith the Sabines. But, besides that the Roman army was thus reinforced,a stratagem also is secretly resorted to, persons having been sent tothrow into the river a great quantity of timber that lay on the banks ofthe Anio, it being first set on fire; and the wood being further kindledby favour of the wind, and the greater[49] part of it (being placed) onrafts, when it stuck firmly impacted against the piers, sets the bridgeon fire. This accident struck terror into the Sabines during the battle,and, after they were routed, impeded their flight; so that many, who hadescaped the enemy, perished in the river. Their arms floating down theTiber, and being recognised at the city, made known the victory, almostbefore any account of it could be carried there. In that action theglory of the cavalry was prominent: they say that, being posted in thetwo wings, when the centre of their own infantry was being beaten, theycharged so briskly in flank, that they not only checked the Sabinelegions who pressed hard on those who retired, but quickly put them toflight. The Sabines made for the mountains with great precipitation, yetfew reached them; for, as we said before, the greatest part were drivenby the cavalry into the river. Tarquin, thinking it advisable to pursuethe enemy closely while in this consternation, after sending the bootyand the prisoners to Rome, piling up and burning the spoils which he hadvowed to Vulcan, proceeds to lead his army onward into the Sabineterritory. And though matters had turned out adversely, nor could theyhope for better success; yet, because the occasion did not allow timefor deliberation, the Sabines came out to meet him with a hastily raisedarmy; and being again defeated there, and matters having now becomedesperate, they sued for peace."Book 1,Chapter 38,"Collatia and all the land about it was taken from the Sabines, andEgerius, son to the king's brother, was left there with a garrison. Iunderstand that the people of Collatia were thus surrendered, and thatthe form of the surrender was as follows: the king asked them, ""Are yeambassadors and deputies sent by the people of Collatia to surrenderyourselves and the people of Collatia?"" ""We are."" ""Are the people ofCollatia their own masters?"" ""They are."" ""Do ye surrender yourselves andthe people of Collatia, their city, lands, water, boundaries, temples,utensils, and every thing sacred or profane belonging to them, into mypower, and that of the Roman people?"" ""We do."" ""Then I receive them.""The Sabine war being ended, Tarquin returned in triumph to Rome. Afterthat he made war upon the ancient Latins, where they came on no occasionto a general engagement; yet by carrying about his arms to the severaltowns, he subdued the whole Latin nation. Corniculum, old Ficulea,Cameria, Crustumerium, Ameriola, Medullia, and Nomentum, towns whicheither belonged to the ancient Latins, or which had revolted to them,were taken. Upon this a peace was concluded. The works of peace werethen set about with greater spirit, even than the efforts with which hehad conducted his wars; so that the people enjoyed no more ease andquiet at home, than they had done abroad: for he both set aboutsurrounding the city with a stone wall, on the side where he had notfortified it, the beginning of which work had been interrupted by theSabine war, and the lower parts of the city round the forum and theother valleys lying between the hills, because they did not easily carryoff the water from the flat grounds, he drains by means of sewers drawnsloping downward into the Tiber. Moreover he levels an area for foundinga temple to Jupiter in the Capitol, which he had vowed to him in theSabine war; his mind even then presaging the future grandeur of theplace."Book 1,Chapter 39,"At that time, a prodigy occurred in the palace, wonderful both inits appearance and in its result. They relate, that the head of a boy,called Servius Tullius, as he lay fast asleep, blazed with fire in thesight of many persons. That by the very great noise made at somiraculous a phenomenon, the royal family were awakened; and when one ofthe servants was bringing water to extinguish the flame, that he waskept back by the queen, and after the confusion was over, that sheforbade the boy to be disturbed till he should awake of his own accord.As soon as he awoke the flame disappeared. Then Tanaquil, taking herhusband into a private place, said, ""Do you observe this boy whom webring up in so mean a style? Be assured that hereafter he will be alight to us in our adversity, and a protector to our palace in distress.From henceforth let us, with all our care, train up this youth, who iscapable of becoming a great ornament publicly and privately."" From thistime the boy began to be treated as their own son, and instructed inthose arts by which men's minds are qualified to maintain high rank. Thematter was easily accomplished, because it was agreeable to the gods.The young man turned out to be of a disposition truly royal. Nor, whenthey looked out for a son-in-law for Tarquin, could any of the Romanyouth be compared to him in any accomplishment; therefore the kingbetrothed his own daughter to him. This high honour conferred upon him,from whatever cause, prevents us from believing that he was the son of aslave, and that he had himself been a slave when young. I am rather ofthe opinion of those who say that, on the taking of Corniculum, the wifeof Servius Tullius, who had been the leading man in that city, beingpregnant when her husband was slain, being known among the other femaleprisoners, and, in consequence of her high rank, exempted from servitudeby the Roman queen, was delivered of a child at Rome, in the house ofTarquinius Priscus. Upon this, that both the intimacy between the ladieswas improved by so great a kindness, and that the boy, having beenbrought up in the house from his infancy, was beloved and respected;that his mother's lot, in having fallen into the hands of the enemy,caused him to be considered the son of a slave."Book 1,Chapter 40,"About the thirty-eighth year of Tarquin's reign, Servius Tullius wasin the highest esteem, not only with the king, but also with the senateand people. At this time the two sons of Ancus, though they had beforethat always considered it the highest indignity that they had beendeprived of their father's crown by the treachery of their guardian,that a stranger should be king of Rome, who was not only not of acivic, but not even of an Italian family, yet now felt their indignationrise to a still higher pitch at the notion that the crown would not onlynot revert to them after Tarquin, but would descend even lower to aslave, so that in the same state about the hundredth year[50] afterRomulus, descended from a deity, and a deity himself, occupied thethrone as long as he lived, a slave, and one born of a slave, should nowpossess it. That it would be a disgrace both common to the Roman name,and more especially to their family, if, whilst there was male issue ofking Ancus still living, the sovereignty of Rome should be accessiblenot only to strangers, but even to slaves. They determine therefore toprevent that disgrace by the sword. But both resentment for the injurydone to them incensed them more against Tarquin himself, than againstServius; and (the consideration) that a king was likely to prove a moresevere avenger of the murder, if he should survive, than a privateperson; and moreover, in case of Servius being put to death, whateverother person he might select as his son-in-law,[51] it seemed likelythat he would adopt as his successor on the throne.[52] For thesereasons the plot is laid against the king himself. Two of the mostferocious of the shepherds being selected for the daring deed, with therustic implements to which each had been accustomed, by conductingthemselves in as violent a manner as possible in the porch of thepalace, under pretence of a quarrel, draw the attention of all theking's attendants to themselves; then, when both appealed to the king,and their clamour reached even the interior of the palace, they arecalled in and proceed before the king. At first both bawled aloud, andvied in interrupting each other by their clamour, until being restrainedby the lictor, and commanded to speak in turns, they at length ceaserailing. According to concert, one begins to state the matter. When theking, attentive to him, had turned himself quite that way, the other,raising up his axe, struck it into his head, and leaving the weapon inthe wound, they both rush out of the house."Book 1,Chapter 41,"When those who were around had raised up the king in a dying state,the lictors seize on the men who were endeavouring to escape. Upon thisfollowed an uproar and concourse of people, wondering what the matterwas. Tanaquil, during the tumult, orders the palace to be shut, thrustsout all who were present: at the same time she sedulously prepares everything necessary for dressing the wound, as if a hope still remained; atthe same time, in case her hopes should disappoint her, she projectsother means of safety. Sending immediately for Servius, after she hadshowed to him her husband almost expiring, holding his right hand, sheentreats him not to suffer the death of his father-in-law to passunavenged, nor his mother-in-law to be an object of insult to theirenemies. ""Servius,"" she said, ""if you are a man, the kingdom is yours,not theirs, who, by the hands of others, have perpetrated the worst ofcrimes. Exert yourself, and follow the guidance of the gods, whoportended that this head would be illustrious by having formerly shed ablaze around it. Now let that celestial flame arouse you. Now awake inearnest. We, too, though foreigners, have reigned. Consider who you are,not whence you are sprung. If your own plans are not matured by reasonof the suddenness of this event, then follow mine."" When the uproar andviolence of the multitude could scarcely be withstood, Tanaquiladdresses the populace from the upper part of the palace through thewindows facing the new street (for the royal family resided near thetemple of Jupiter Stator). She bids them ""be of good courage; that theking was stunned by the suddenness of the blow; that the weapon had notsunk deep into his body; that he was already come to himself again; thatthe wound had been examined, the blood having been wiped off; that allthe symptoms were favourable; that she hoped they would see him verysoon; and that, in the mean time, he commanded the people to obey theorders of Servius Tullius. That he would administer justice, and wouldperform all the functions of the king."" Servius comes forth with thetrabea and lictors, and seating himself on the king's throne, decidessome cases, with respect to others pretends that he will consult theking. Therefore, the death being concealed for several days, thoughTarquin had already expired, he, under pretence of discharging the dutyof another, strengthened his own interest. Then at length the matterbeing made public, and lamentations being raised in the palace, Servius,supported by a strong guard, took possession of the kingdom by theconsent of the senate, being the first who did so without the orders ofthe people. The children of Ancus, the instruments of their villanyhaving been already seized, as soon as it was announced that the kingstill lived, and that the power of Servius was so great, had alreadygone into exile to Suessa Pometia."Book 1,Chapter 42,"And now Servius began to strengthen his power, not more bypublic[53] than by private measures; and lest the feelings of thechildren of Tarquin might be the same towards himself as those of thechildren of Ancus had been towards Tarquin, he unites his two daughtersin marriage to the young princes, the Tarquinii, Lucius and Aruns. Noryet did he break through the inevitable decrees of fate by humanmeasures, so that envy of the sovereign power should not produce generaltreachery and animosity even among the members of his own family. Veryopportunely for maintaining the tranquillity of the present state, a warwas commenced with the Veientes (for the truce had now expired[54]) andwith the other Etrurians. In that war, both the valour and good fortuneof Tullius were conspicuous, and he returned to Rome, after routing agreat army of the enemy, now unquestionably king, whether he tried thedispositions of the fathers or the people. He then sets about a work ofpeace of the utmost importance; that, as Numa had been the author ofreligious institutions, so posterity might celebrate Servius as thefounder of all distinction among the members of the state, and of thoseorders by which a limitation is established between the degrees of rankand fortune. For he instituted the census, a most salutary measure foran empire destined to become so great, according to which the servicesof war and peace were to be performed, not by every person,(indiscriminately,) as formerly, but in proportion to the amount ofproperty. Then he formed, according to the census, the classes andcenturies, and the arrangement as it now exists, eminently suited eitherto peace or war."Book 1,Chapter 43,"Of those who had an estate of a hundred thousand asses or more, hemade eighty centuries, forty of seniors and forty of juniors. All thesewere called the first class, the seniors were to be in readiness toguard the city, the juniors to carry on war abroad. The arms enjoinedthem were a helmet, a round shield, greaves, and a coat of mail, all ofbrass; these were for the defence of their body; their weapons ofoffence were a spear and a sword. To this class were added two centuriesof mechanics, who were to serve without arms; the duty imposed upon themwas to carry the military engines. The second class comprehended allwhose estate was from seventy-five to a hundred thousand asses, and ofthese, seniors and juniors, twenty centuries were enrolled. The armsenjoined them were a buckler instead of a shield, and except a coat ofmail, all the rest were the same. He appointed the property of the thirdclass to amount to fifty thousand asses; the number of centuries was thesame, and formed with the same distinction of age, nor was there anychange in their arms, only greaves were taken from them. In the fourthclass, the property was twenty-five thousand asses, the same number ofcenturies was formed: the arms were changed, nothing was given them buta spear and a long javelin. The fifth class was increased, thirtycenturies were formed; these carried slings and stones for throwing.Among them were reckoned the horn-blowers, and the trumpeters,distributed into three centuries. This whole class was rated at eleventhousand asses. Property lower than this comprehended all the rest ofthe citizens, and of them one century was made up which was exemptedfrom serving in war. Having thus divided and armed the infantry, helevied twelve centuries of knights from among the chief men of thestate. Likewise out of the three centuries, appointed by Romulus, heformed other six under the same names which they had received at theirfirst institution. Ten thousand asses were given them out of the publicrevenue, for the buying of horses, and widows were assigned them, whowere to pay two thousand asses yearly for the support of the horses. Allthese burdens were taken off the poor and laid on the rich. Then anadditional honour was conferred upon them; for the suffrage was not nowgranted promiscuously to all, as it had been established by Romulus, andobserved by his successors, to every man with the same privilege and thesame right, but gradations were established, so that no one might seemexcluded from the right of voting, and yet the whole power might residein the chief men of the state. For the knights were first called, andthen the eighty centuries of the first class; and if they happened todiffer, which was seldom the case, those of the second were called: andthey seldom ever descended so low as to come to the lowest class. Norneed we be surprised, that the present regulation, which now exists,since the tribes were increased to thirty-five, should not agree in thenumber of centuries of juniors and seniors with the amount instituted byServius Tullius, they being now double of what they were at that time.For the city being divided into four parts, according to the regions andhills which were then inhabited, he called these divisions tribes, as Ithink, from the tribute.[55] For the method of levying taxes rateablyaccording to the value of estates was also introduced by him; nor hadthese tribes any relation to the number and distribution of thecenturies."Book 1,Chapter 44,"The census being now completed, which he had expedited by the terrorof a law passed on those not rated, with threats of imprisonment anddeath, he issued a proclamation that all the Roman citizens, horse andfoot, should attend at the dawn of day in the Campus Martius, each inhis century. There he drew up his army and performed a lustration of itby the sacrifices called suovetaurilia, and that was called the closingof the lustrum, because that was the conclusion of the census. Eightythousand citizens are said to have been rated in that survey. FabiusPictor, the oldest of our historians, adds, that such was the number ofthose who were able to bear arms. To accommodate that number the cityseemed to require enlargement. He adds two hills, the Quirinal andViminal; then in continuation he enlarges the Esquili¾, and takes up hisown residence there, in order that respectability might attach to theplace. He surrounds the city with a rampart, a moat, and a wall: thus heenlarges the pomÏrium. They who regard only the etymology of theword, will have the pomÏrium to be a space of ground without thewalls; but it is rather a space on each side the wall, which theEtrurians in building cities consecrated by augury, reaching to acertain extent both within and without in the direction they intended toraise the wall; so that the houses might not be joined to it on theinside, as they commonly are now, and also that there might be somespace without left free from human occupation. This space, which it wasnot lawful to till or inhabit, the Romans called the pomÏrium, notfor its being without the wall, more than for the wall's being withoutit: and in enlarging the city, as far as the walls were intended toproceed outwards, so far these consecrated limits were likewiseextended."Book 1,Chapter 45,"The state being increased by the enlargement of the city, and everything modelled at home and abroad for the exigencies both of peace andwar, that the acquisition of power might not always depend on mere forceof arms, he endeavoured to extend his empire by policy, and at the sametime to add some ornament to the city. [56]The temple of Diana atEphesus was at that time in high renown; fame represented it to havebeen built by all the states of Asia, in common. When Servius, amid somegrandees of the Latins with whom he had taken pains to form connexionsof hospitality and friendship, extolled in high terms such concord andassociation of their gods, by frequently insisting on the same subject,he at length prevailed so far as that the Latin states agreed to build atemple to Diana at Rome, in conjunction with the Roman people. This wasan acknowledgment that Rome was the head of both nations, concerningwhich they had so often disputed in arms. Though that object seemed tohave been left out of consideration by all the Latins, in consequence ofthe matter having been so often attempted unsuccessfully by arms,fortune seemed to present one of the Sabines with an opportunity ofrecovering the superiority to his country by his own address. A cow issaid to have been calved to a certain person, the head of a family amongthe Sabines, of surprising size and beauty. Her horns, which were hungup in the porch of the temple of Diana, remained, for many ages, amonument of this wonder. The thing was looked upon as a prodigy, as itwas, and the soothsayers declared, that sovereignty would reside in thatstate of which a citizen should immolate this heifer to Diana. Thisprediction had also reached the ears of the high priest of Diana. TheSabine, when he thought the proper time for offering the sacrifice wascome, drove the cow to Rome, led her to the temple of that goddess, andset her before the altar. The Roman priest, struck with the uncommonsize of the victim, so much celebrated by fame, thus accosted theSabine: ""What intendest thou to do, stranger?"" says he. ""Is it withimpure hands to offer a sacrifice to Diana? Why dost not thou first washthyself in running water? The Tiber runs along in the bottom of thatvalley."" The stranger, being seized with a scruple of conscience, anddesirous of having every thing done in due form, that the event mightanswer the prediction, from the temple went down to the Tiber. In themean time the priest sacrificed the cow to Diana, which gave greatsatisfaction to the king, and to the whole state."Book 1,Chapter 46,"Servius, though he had now acquired an indisputable right to thekingdom by long possession, yet as he heard that expressions weresometimes thrown out by young Tarquin, importing, ""That he held thecrown without the consent of the people,"" having first secured theirgood will by dividing among them, man by man, the lands taken from theirenemies, he ventured to propose the question to the people, whether they""chose and ordered that he should be king,"" and was declared king withsuch unanimity, as had not been observed in the election of any of hispredecessors. But this circumstance diminished not Tarquin's hope ofobtaining the throne; nay, because he had observed that the question ofthe distribution of land to the people[57] was carried against the willof the fathers, he felt so much the more satisfied that an opportunitywas now presented to him of arraigning Servius before the fathers, andof increasing his own influence in the senate, he being himselfnaturally of a fiery temper, and his wife, Tullia, at home stimulatinghis restless temper. For the Roman palace also afforded an instance oftragic guilt, so that through their disgust of kings, liberty might comemore matured, and the throne, which should be attained through crime,might be the last. This L. Tarquinius (whether he was the son orgrandson of Tarquinius Priscus is not clear; with the greater number ofauthorities, however, I would say, his son[58]) had a brother, ArunsTarquinius, a youth of a mild disposition. To these two, as has beenalready stated, the two Tulli¾, daughters of the king, had been married,they also being of widely different tempers. It had so happened that thetwo violent dispositions were not united in marriage, through the goodfortune, I suspect, of the Roman people, in order that the reign ofServius might be more protracted, and the morals of the state be firmlyestablished. The haughty Tullia was chagrined, that there was nomaterial in her husband, either for ambition or bold daring. Directingall her regard to the other Tarquinius, him she admired, him she calleda man, and one truly descended of royal blood; she expressed hercontempt of her sister, because, having got a man, she was deficient inthe spirit becoming a woman. Similarity of mind soon draws themtogether, as wickedness is in general most congenial to wickedness. Butthe commencement of producing general confusion originated with thewoman. She, accustomed to the secret conversations of the other'shusband, refrained not from using the most contumelious language of herhusband to his brother, of her sister to (her sister's) husband, andcontended, that it were better that she herself were unmarried, and hesingle, than that they should be matched unsuitably, so that they mustlanguish away through life by reason of the dastardly conduct of others.If the gods had granted her the husband of whom she was worthy, that sheshould soon see the crown in her own house, which she now saw at herfather's. She soon inspires the young man with her own daring notions.Aruns Tarquinius and the younger Tullia, when they had, by immediatesuccessive deaths, made their houses vacant for new nuptials, are unitedin marriage, Servius rather not prohibiting than approving the measure."Book 1,Chapter 47,"Then indeed the old age of Servius began to be every day moredisquieted, his reign to be more unhappy. For now the woman looked fromone crime to another, and suffered not her husband to rest by night orby day, lest their past murders might go for nothing. ""That what she hadwanted was not a person whose wife she might be called, or one with whomshe might in silence live a slave; what she had wanted was one who wouldconsider himself worthy of the throne; who would remember that he wasthe son of Tarquinius Priscus; who would rather possess a kingdom thanhope for it. If you, to whom I consider myself married, are such a one,I address you both as husband and king; but if not, our condition hasbeen changed so far for the worse, as in that person crime is associatedwith meanness. Why not prepare yourself? It is not necessary for you, asfor your father, (coming here) from Corinth or Tarquinii, to strive forforeign thrones. Your household and country's gods, the image of yourfather, and the royal palace, and the royal throne in that palace,constitute and call you king. Or if you have too little spirit for this,why do you disappoint the nation? Why do you suffer yourself to belooked up to as a prince? Get hence to Tarquinii or Corinth. Sink backagain to your (original) race, more like your brother than your father.""By chiding him in these and other terms, she spurs on the young man; norcan she herself rest; (indignant) that when Tanaquil, a foreign woman,could achieve so great a project, as to bestow two successive thrones onher husband, and then on her son-in-law, she, sprung from royal blood,should have no weight in bestowing and taking away a kingdom.Tarquinius, driven on by these frenzied instigations of the woman,began to go round and solicit the patricians, especially those of theyounger families;[59] reminded them of his father's kindness, andclaimed a return for it; enticed the young men by presents; increasedhis interest, as well by making magnificent promises on his own part, asby inveighing against the king at every opportunity. At length, as soonas the time seemed convenient for accomplishing his object, he rushedinto the forum, accompanied by a party of armed men; then, whilst allwere struck with dismay, seating himself on the throne before thesenate-house, he ordered the fathers to be summoned to the senate-houseby the crier to attend king Tarquinius. They assembled immediately, somebeing already prepared for the occasion, some through fear, lest theirnot having come might prove detrimental to them, astounded at thenovelty and strangeness of the matter, and considering that it was nowall over with Servius. Then Tarquinius, commencing his invectivesagainst his immediate ancestors: ""that a slave, and born of a slave,after the untimely death of his parent, without an interregnum beingadopted, as on former occasions, without any comitia (being held),without the suffrages of the people, or the sanction of the fathers, hehad taken possession of the kingdom as the gift of a woman. That soborn, so created king, ever a favourer of the most degraded class, towhich he himself belongs, through a hatred of the high station ofothers, he had taken their land from the leading men of the state anddivided it among the very meanest; that he had laid all the burdens,which were formerly common, on the chief members of the community; thathe had instituted the census, in order that the fortune of the wealthiercitizens might be conspicuous to (excite) public envy, and that all wasprepared whence he might bestow largesses on the most needy, whenever hemight please."""Book 1,Chapter 48,"When Servius, aroused by the alarming announcement, came in duringthis harangue, immediately from the porch of the senate-house, he sayswith a loud voice, ""What means this, Tarquin? by what audacity hast thoudared to summon the fathers, while I am still alive? or to sit on mythrone?"" To this, when he fiercely replied ""that he, the son of a king,occupied the throne of his father, a much fitter successor to the thronethan a slave; that he (Servius) had insulted his masters full longenough by his arbitrary shuffling,"" a shout arises from the partisans ofboth, and a rush of the people into the senate-house took place, and itbecame evident that whoever came off victor would have the throne. ThenTarquin, necessity itself now obliging him to have recourse to the lastextremity, having much the advantage both in years and strength, seizesServius by the middle, and having taken him out of the senate-house,throws him down the steps to the bottom. He then returns to thesenate-house to assemble the senate. The king's officers and attendantsfly. He himself, almost lifeless, when he was returning home with hisroyal retinue frightened to death, and had arrived at the top of theCyprian street, is slain by those who had been sent by Tarquin, and hadovertaken him in his flight. As the act is not inconsistent with herother marked conduct, it is believed to have been done by Tullia'sadvice. Certain it is, (for it is readily admitted,) that driving intothe forum in her chariot, and not abashed by the crowd of persons there,she called her husband out of the senate-house, and was the first tostyle him king; and when, on being commanded by him to withdraw fromsuch a tumult, she was returning home, and had arrived at the top of theCyprian street, where Diana's temple lately was, as she was turning tothe right to the Orbian hill, in order to arrive at the Esquiline, theperson who was driving, being terrified, stopped and drew in the reins,and pointed out to his mistress the murdered Servius as he lay. On thisoccasion a revolting and inhuman crime is stated to have been committed,and the place is a monument of it. They call it the Wicked Street, whereTullia, frantic and urged on by the furies of her sister and husband, isreported to have driven her chariot over her father's body, and to havecarried a portion of her father's body and blood to her own and herhusband's household gods, herself also being stained and sprinkled withit; through whose vengeance results corresponding to the wickedcommencement of the reign were soon to follow. Tullius reignedforty-four years in such a manner that a competition with him wouldprove difficult even for a good and moderate successor. But this alsohas been an accession to his glory, that with him perished all just andlegitimate reigns. This authority, so mild and so moderate, yet, becauseit was vested in one, some say that he had it in contemplation toresign,[60] had not the wickedness of his family interfered with himwhilst meditating the liberation of his country."Book 1,Chapter 49,"After this period Tarquin began his reign, whose actions procuredhim the surname of the Proud, for he refused his father-in-law burial,alleging, that even Romulus died without sepulture. He put to death theprincipal senators, whom he suspected of having been in the interest ofServius. Then, conscious that the precedent of obtaining the crown byevil means might be adopted from him against himself, he surrounded hisperson with armed men, for he had no claim to the kingdom except force,inasmuch as he reigned without either the order of the people or thesanction of the senate. To this was added (the fact) that, as he reposedno hope in the affection of his subjects, he found it necessary tosecure his kingdom by terror; and in order to strike this into thegreater number, he took cognizance of capital cases solely by himselfwithout assessors; and under that pretext he had it in his power to putto death, banish, or fine, not only those who were suspected or hated,but those also from whom he could obtain nothing else but plunder. Thenumber of the fathers more especially being thus diminished, hedetermined to elect none into the senate, in order that the order mightbecome contemptible by their very paucity, and that they might feel theless resentment at no business being transacted by them. For he was thefirst king who violated the custom derived from his predecessors ofconsulting the senate on all subjects; he administered the publicbusiness by domestic counsels. War, peace, treaties, alliances, hecontracted and dissolved with whomsoever he pleased, without thesanction of the people and senate. The nation of the Latins inparticular he wished to attach to him, so that by foreign influence alsohe might be more secure among his own subjects; and he contracted notonly ties of hospitality but affinities also with their leading men. ToOctavius Mamilius of Tusculum he gives his daughter in marriage; (he wasby far the most eminent of the Latin name, being descended, if webelieve tradition, from Ulysses and the goddess Circe, and by this matchhe attaches to himself his numerous kinsmen and friends)."Book 1,Chapter 50,"The influence of Tarquin among the chief men of the Latins was nowconsiderable, when he issues an order that they should assemble on acertain day at the grove of Ferentina; that there was business aboutwhich he wished to confer with them touching their common interest. Theyassemble in great numbers at the break of day. Tarquinius himselfobserved the day indeed, but he came a little before sun-set. Manymatters were there canvassed in the meeting in various conversations.Turnus Herdonius, from Aricia, inveighed violently against Tarquin forhis absence. ""That it was no wonder the cognomen of Proud was given himat Rome;"" for they now called him so secretly and in whispers, but stillgenerally. ""Could anything be more proud than thus to trifle with theentire nation of the Latins? After their chiefs had been called at sogreat a distance from home, that he who summoned the meeting did notattend; that no doubt their patience was tried, in order that if theysubmitted to the yoke, he may crush them when at his mercy. For to whomdid it not plainly appear that he was aiming at sovereignty over theLatins? But if his own countrymen did well in intrusting it to him, orif it was intrusted, and not seized on by means of murder, that theLatins also ought to intrust him (though not even so, inasmuch as he wasa foreigner). But if his own subjects are dissatisfied with him, (seeingthat they are butchered one upon another, driven into exile, anddeprived of their property,) what better prospects are held out to theLatins? If they follow his advice, that they would depart thence, eachto his own home, and take no more notice of the day of meeting than theperson who appointed it."" When this man, turbulent and daring, and onewho had attained influence at home by these means, was pressing theseand other observations having the same tendency, Tarquin came in. Thisput a conclusion to his harangue. All turned away from him to saluteTarquin, who, on silence being enjoined, being advised by those next himto apologize for having come at that time, says, that he had been chosenarbiter between a father and a son; that, from his anxiety to reconcilethem, he had delayed; and because that circumstance had consumed thatday, that on the morrow he would transact the business which he haddetermined on. They say that he did not make even that observationwithout a remark from Turnus; ""that no controversy was shorter than onebetween a father and son, and that it might be decided in a fewwords,--unless he submitted to his father, that he must proveunfortunate."""Book 1,Chapter 51,"The Arician withdrew from the meeting, uttering these reflectionsagainst the Roman king. Tarquin, feeling the matter much more acutelythan he appeared to do, immediately sets about planning the death ofTurnus, in order that he might inspire into the Latins the same terrorwith which he had crushed the spirits of his own subjects at home; andbecause he could not be put to death openly, by virtue of his authority,he accomplished the ruin of this innocent man by bringing a falseaccusation against him. By means of some Aricians of the oppositefaction, he bribed a servant of Turnus with gold, to suffer a greatnumber of swords to be introduced privately into his lodging. When thishad been completed in the course of one night, Tarquin, having summonedthe chiefs of the Latins to him a little before day, as if alarmed bysome strange occurrence, says, ""that his delay of yesterday, having beenoccasioned as it were by some providential care of the gods, had beenthe means of preservation to him and them; that it was told to him thatdestruction was prepared by Turnus for him and the chiefs of the Latins,that he alone might obtain the government of the Latins. That he was tohave made the attempt yesterday at the meeting; that the matter wasdeferred, because the person who summoned the meeting was absent, whomhe chiefly aimed at. That thence arose that abuse of him for beingabsent, because he disappointed his hopes by delaying. That he had nodoubt, but that if the truth were told him, he would come at the breakof day, when the assembly met, attended with a band of conspirators, andwith arms in his hands. That it was said that a great number of swordshad been conveyed to his house. Whether that be true or not, might beknown immediately. He requested that they would accompany him thence toTurnus."" Both the daring temper of Turnus, and his harangue ofyesterday, and the delay of Tarquin, rendered the matter suspicious,because it seemed possible that the murder might have been put off inconsequence of it. They proceed then with minds inclined indeed tobelieve, yet determined to consider every thing false, unless the swordswere detected. When they arrived there, Turnus is aroused from sleep,and guards are placed around him; and the servants, who, from affectionto their master, were preparing to use force, being secured, when theswords, which had been concealed, were drawn out from all parts of thelodging, then indeed the whole matter appeared manifest, and chains wereplaced on Turnus; and forthwith a meeting of the Latins was summonedamid great confusion. There, on the swords being brought forward in themidst, such violent hatred arose against him, that without being alloweda defence, by a novel mode of death, being thrown into the reservoir ofthe water of Ferentina, a hurdle[61] being placed over him, and stonesbeing thrown into that, he was drowned."Book 1,Chapter 52,"Tarquin, having recalled the Latins to the meeting, and applaudedthose who had inflicted well-merited punishment on Turnus, as oneconvicted of parricide, by his attempting a change of government, spokeas follows: ""That he could indeed proceed by a long-established right;because, since all the Latins were sprung from Alba, they were includedin that treaty by which the entire Alban nation, with their colonies,fell under the dominion of Rome, under Tullus. However, for the sake ofthe interest of all parties, he thought rather, that that treaty shouldbe renewed; and that the Latins should, as participators, enjoy theprosperity of the Roman people, rather than that they should beconstantly either apprehending or suffering the demolition of their townand the devastations of their lands, which they suffered formerly in thereign of Ancus, afterwards in the reign of his own father."" The Latinswere persuaded without any difficulty, though in that treaty theadvantage lay on the side of Rome; but they both saw that the chiefs ofthe Latin nation sided and concurred with the king, and Turnus was arecent instance of his danger to each, if he should make any opposition.Thus the treaty was renewed, and notice was given to the young men ofthe Latins, that, according to the treaty, they should attend inconsiderable numbers in arms, on a certain day, at the grove ofFerentina. And when they assembled from all the states according to theedict of the Roman king, in order that they should neither have ageneral of their own, nor a separate command, or their own standards, hecompounded companies of Latins and Romans, so as to make one out of two,and two out of one; the companies being thus doubled, he appointedcenturions over them."Book 1,Chapter 53,"Nor was Tarquin, though a tyrannical prince in peace, a despicablegeneral in war; nay, he would have equalled his predecessors in thatart, had not his [62]degeneracy in other respects likewise detractedfrom his merit here. He began the war against the Volsci, which lastedtwo hundred years after his time, and took from them Suessa Pometia bystorm; and when by the sale of the spoils he had amassed forty talentsof silver and of gold, he designed such magnificence for a temple toJupiter, as should be worthy of the king of gods and men, of the Romanempire, and of the majesty of the place itself: for the building of thistemple he set apart the money arising from the spoils. Soon after a warcame upon him, more tedious than he expected, in which, having in vainattempted to storm Gabii, a city in his neighbourhood, when beingrepulsed from the walls all hopes of taking it by siege also was takenfrom him, he assailed it by fraud and stratagem, arts by no means Roman.For when, as if the war was laid aside, he pretended to be busily takenup with laying the foundation of the temple, and with his other works inthe city, Sextus, the youngest of his three sons, according to concert,fled to Gabii, complaining of the inhuman cruelty of his father, ""thathe had turned his tyranny from others against his own family, and wasuneasy at the number of his own children, intending to make the samedesolations in his own house which he had made in the senate, in orderthat he might leave behind him no issue, nor heir to his kingdom. Thatfor his own part, as he had escaped from amidst the swords and otherweapons of his father, he was persuaded he could find no safety anywhere but among the enemies of L. Tarquin. And, that they might not beled astray, that the war, which it is now pretended has been given up,still lies in reserve, and that he would attack them when off theirguard on the occurrence of an opportunity. But if there be no refugefor suppliants among them, that he would traverse all Latium, and wouldapply to the Volscians, and ®quians, and Hernicians, until he shouldcome to those who knew how to protect children from the impious andcruel persecution of parents. That perhaps he would find some ardouralso to take up arms and wage war against this proud king and hishaughty subjects."" As he seemed a person likely to go further onward,incensed with anger, if they paid him no regard, he is received by theGabians very kindly. They bid him not to be surprised, if he were atlast the same to his children as he had been to his subjects andallies;--that he would ultimately vent his rage on himself if otherobjects failed him;--that his coming was very acceptable to them, andthey thought that it would come to pass that by his aid the war would betransferred from the gates of Gabii to the walls of Rome."Book 1,Chapter 54,"Upon this he was admitted into their public councils, where though,with regard to other matters, he professed to submit to the judgment ofthe old inhabitants of Gabii, to whom they were better known, yet heevery now and then advised them to renew the war; to that he pretendedto a superior knowledge, because he was well acquainted with thestrength of both nations, and knew that the king's pride was decidedlybecome hateful to his subjects, which not even his own children couldnow endure. As he thus by degrees stirred up the nobles of the Gabiansto renew the war, went himself with the most active of their youth onplundering parties and expeditions, and ill-grounded credit was attachedto all his words and actions, framed as they were for deception, he isat length chosen general-in-chief in the war. There when, the peoplebeing still ignorant of what was really going on, several skirmisheswith the Romans took place, wherein the Gabians generally had theadvantage, then all the Gabians, from the highest to the lowest, werefirmly persuaded, that Sextus Tarquinius had been sent to them as theirgeneral, by the special favour of the gods. By his exposing himself tofatigues and dangers, and by his generosity in dividing the plunder, hewas so beloved by the soldiers, that Tarquin the father had not greaterpower at Rome than the son at Gabii. When he saw he had got sufficientstrength collected to support him in any undertaking, he sent one ofhis confidants to Rome to ask his father what he wished him to do,seeing the gods had granted him the sole management of all affairs atGabii. To this courier no answer by word of mouth was given, because, Isuppose, he appeared of questionable fidelity. The king going into agarden of the palace, as it were to consider of the matter, followed byhis son's messenger; walking there for some time in silence, he is saidto have struck off the heads of the tallest poppies with his staff. Themessenger, wearied with demanding and waiting for an answer, returned toGabii as if without having accomplished his object, and told what he hadsaid himself, and what he had observed, adding, ""that Tarquin, eitherthrough passion, aversion to him, or his innate pride, had not spoke aword."" As soon as it became evident to Sextus what his father wished,and what conduct he recommended by those silent intimations, he put todeath the most eminent men of the city, accusing some of them to thepeople, and others who were exposed by their own unpopularity. Many wereexecuted publicly, and some, against whom an impeachment was likely toprove less specious, were secretly assassinated. Means of escape were tosome allowed, and others were banished, and their estates, as well asthe estates of those who were put to death, publicly distributed. By thesweets of corruption, plunder, and private advantage resulting fromthese distributions, the sense of the public calamities becameextinguished in them, till the state of Gabii, destitute of counsel andassistance, was delivered without a struggle into the hands of the Romanking."Book 1,Chapter 55,"Tarquin, thus put in possession of Gabii, made peace with the®quians, and renewed the treaty with the Etrurians. Then he turned histhoughts to the business of the city. The chief whereof was that ofleaving behind him the temple of Jupiter on the Tarpeian mount, as amonument of his name and reign; [since posterity would remember] that oftwo Tarquinii, both kings, the father had vowed, the son completed it.And that the area, excluding all other forms of worship, might beentirely appropriated to Jupiter, and his temple, which was to beerected upon it, he resolved to unhallow several small temples andchapels, which had been vowed first by king Tatius, in the heat of thebattle against Romulus, and which he afterwards consecrated anddedicated. In the very beginning of founding this work it is said thatthe gods exerted their divinity to presage the future greatness of thisempire; for though the birds declared for the unhallowing of all theother temples, they did not admit of it with respect to that ofTerminus. This omen and augury were taken to import that Terminus's notchanging his residence, and being the only one of the gods who was notcalled out of the places devoted to their worship, presaged the durationand stability of their empire. This being deemed an omen of theperpetuity, there followed another portending the greatness of theempire. It is reported that the head of a man, with the face entire,appeared to the workmen when digging the foundation of the temple. Thesight of this phenomenon unequivocally presaged that this temple shouldbe the metropolis of the empire, and the head of the world; and sodeclared the soothsayers, both those who were in the city, and thosewhom they had sent for from Etruria, to consult on this subject. Theking was encouraged to enlarge the expense; so that the spoils ofPometia, which had been destined to complete the work, scarcely sufficedfor laying the foundation. On this account I am more inclined to believeFabius Pictor, besides his being the more ancient historian, that therewere only forty talents, than Piso, who says that forty thousand poundsweight of silver were set apart for that purpose; a sum of money neitherto be expected from the spoils of any one city in those times, and onethat would more than suffice for the foundation of any structure, eventhough exhibiting the magnificence of modern structures."Book 1,Chapter 56,"Tarquin, intent upon finishing this temple, having sent for workmenfrom all parts of Etruria, employed on it not only the public money, butthe manual labour of the people; and when this labour, by no meansinconsiderable in itself, was added to their military service, still thepeople murmured less at their building the temples of the gods withtheir own hands; they were afterwards transferred to other works, which,whilst less in show, (required) still greater toil: such as the erectingbenches in the circus, and conducting under ground the principalsewer,[63] the receptacle of all the filth of the city; to which twoworks even modern splendour can scarcely produce any thing equal. Thepeople having been employed in these works, because he both consideredthat such a multitude was a burden to the city when there was noemployment for them, and further, he was anxious that the frontiers ofthe empire should be more extensively occupied by sending colonists, hesent colonists to Signia and Circeii, to serve as defensive barriershereafter to the city by land and sea. While he was thus employed afrightful prodigy appeared to him. A serpent sliding out of a woodenpillar, after causing dismay and a run into the palace, not so muchstruck the king's heart with sudden terror, as filled him with anxioussolicitude. Accordingly when Etrurian soothsayers only were employed forpublic prodigies, terrified at this as it were domestic apparition, hedetermined on sending persons to Delphos to the most celebrated oraclein the world; and not venturing to intrust the responses of the oracleto any other person, he despatched his two sons to Greece through landsunknown at that time, and seas still more so. Titus and Aruns were thetwo who went. To them were added, as a companion, L. Junius Brutus, theson of Tarquinia, sister to the king, a youth of an entirely differentquality of mind from that the disguise of which he had assumed. Brutus,on hearing that the chief men of the city, and among others his ownbrother, had been put to death by his uncle, resolved to leave nothingin his intellects that might be dreaded by the king, nor any thing inhis fortune to be coveted, and thus to be secure in contempt, wherethere was but little protection in justice. Therefore designedlyfashioning himself to the semblance of foolishness, after he sufferedhimself and his whole estate to become a prey to the king, he did notrefuse to take even the surname of Brutus, that, concealed under thecover of such a cognomen, that genius that was to liberate the Romanpeople might await its proper time. He, being brought to Delphos by theTarquinii rather as a subject of sport than as a companion, is said tohave brought with him as an offering to Apollo a golden rod, enclosed ina staff of cornel-wood hollowed out for the purpose, a mystical emblemof his own mind. When they arrived there, their father's commissionbeing executed, a desire seized the young men of inquiring on which ofthem the sovereignty of Rome should devolve. They say that a voice wasreturned from the bottom of the cave, ""Young men, whichever of you shallfirst kiss his mother shall enjoy the sovereign power at Rome."" TheTarquinii order the matter to be kept secret with the utmost care, thatSextus, who had been left behind at Rome, might be ignorant of theresponse, and have no share in the kingdom; they cast lots amongthemselves, as to which of them should first kiss his mother, after theyhad returned to Rome. Brutus, thinking that the Pythian response hadanother meaning, as if he had stumbled and fallen, touched the groundwith his lips; she being, forsooth, the common mother of all mankind.After this they all returned to Rome, where preparations were being madewith the greatest vigour for a war against the Rutulians."Book 1,Chapter 57,"The Rutulians, a nation very wealthy, considering the country andage they lived in, were at that time in possession of Ardea. Theirriches gave occasion to the war; for the king of the Romans, beingexhausted of money by the magnificence of his public works, was desirousboth to enrich himself, and by a large booty to soothe the minds of hissubjects, who, besides other instances of his tyranny, were incensedagainst his government, because they were indignant that they had beenkept so long a time by the king in the employments of mechanics, and inlabour fit for slaves. An attempt was made to take Ardea by storm; whenthat did not succeed, the enemy began to be distressed by a blockade,and by works raised around them. As it commonly happens in standingcamps, the war being rather tedious than violent, furloughs were easilyobtained, more so by the officers, however, than the common soldiers.The young princes sometimes spent their leisure hours in feasting andentertainments. One day as they were drinking in the tent of SextusTarquin, where Collatinus Tarquinius, the son of Egerius, was also atsupper, mention was made of wives. Every one commended his own in anextravagant manner, till a dispute arising about it, Collatinus said,""There was no occasion for words, that it might be known in a few hourshow far his Lucretia excelled all the rest. If then, added he, we haveany share of the vigour of youth, let us mount our horses and examinethe behaviour of our wives; that must be most satisfactory to every one,which shall meet his eyes on the unexpected arrival of the husband.""They were heated with wine; ""Come on, then,"" say all. They immediatelygalloped to Rome, where they arrived in the dusk of the evening. Fromthence they went to Collatia, where they find Lucretia, not like theking's daughters-in-law, whom they had seen spending their time inluxurious entertainments with their equals, but though at an advancedtime of night, employed at her wool, sitting in the middle of the houseamid her maids working around her. The merit of the contest regardingthe ladies was assigned to Lucretia. Her husband on his arrival, and theTarquinii, were kindly received; the husband, proud of his victory,gives the young princes a polite invitation. There the villanous passionfor violating Lucretia by force seizes Sextus Tarquin; both her beauty,and her approved purity, act as incentives. And then, after thisyouthful frolic of the night, they return to the camp."Book 1,Chapter 58,"A few days after, without the knowledge of Collatinus, Sextus cameto Collatia with one attendant only; where, being kindly received bythem, as not being aware of his intention, after he had been conductedafter supper into the guests' chamber, burning with passion, when everything around seemed sufficiently secure, and all fast asleep, he comesto Lucretia, as she lay asleep, with a naked sword, and with his lefthand pressing down the woman's breast, he says, ""Be silent, Lucretia; Iam Sextus Tarquin; I have a sword in my hand; you shall die, if youutter a word."" When awaking terrified from sleep, the woman beheld noaid, impending death nigh at hand; then Tarquin acknowledged hispassion, entreated, mixed threats with entreaties, tried the female'smind in every possible way. When he saw her inflexible, and that she wasnot moved even by the terror of death, he added to terror the threat ofdishonour; he says that he will lay a murdered slave naked by her sidewhen dead, so that she may be said to have been slain in infamousadultery. When by the terror of this disgrace his lust, as it werevictorious, had overcome her inflexible chastity, and Tarquin haddeparted, exulting in having triumphed over a lady's honour, Lucretia,in melancholy distress at so dreadful a misfortune, despatches the samemessenger to Rome to her father, and to Ardea to her husband, that theywould come each with one trusty friend; that it was necessary to do so,and that quickly.[64] Sp. Lucretius comes with P. Valerius, the son ofVolesus, Collatinus with L. Junius Brutus, with whom, as he wasreturning to Rome, he happened to be met by his wife's messenger. Theyfind Lucretia sitting in her chamber in sorrowful dejection. On thearrival of her friends the tears burst from her eyes; and to herhusband, on his inquiry ""whether all was right,"" she says, ""By no means,for what can be right with a woman who has lost her honour? The tracesof another man are on your bed, Collatinus. But the body only has beenviolated, the mind is guiltless; death shall be my witness. But give meyour right hands, and your honour, that the adulterer shall not come offunpunished. It is Sextus Tarquin, who, an enemy in the guise of a guest,has borne away hence a triumph fatal to me, and to himself, if you aremen."" They all pledge their honour; they attempt to console her,distracted as she was in mind, by turning away the guilt from her,constrained by force, on the perpetrator of the crime; that it is themind sins, not the body; and that where intention was wanting guiltcould not be. ""It is for you to see,"" says she, ""what is due to him. Asfor me, though I acquit myself of guilt, from punishment I do notdischarge myself; nor shall any woman survive her dishonour pleading theexample of Lucretia."" The knife, which she kept concealed beneath hergarment, she plunges into her heart, and falling forward on the wound,she dropped down expiring. The husband and father shriek aloud."Book 1,Chapter 59,"Brutus, while they were overpowered with grief, having drawn theknife out of the wound, and holding it up before him reeking with blood,said, ""By this blood, most pure before the pollution of royal villany, Iswear, and I call you, O gods, to witness my oath, that I shall pursueLucius Tarquin the Proud, his wicked wife, and all their race, withfire, sword, and all other means in my power; nor shall I ever sufferthem or any other to reign at Rome."" Then he gave the knife toCollatinus, and after him to Lucretius and Valerius, who were surprisedat such extraordinary mind in the breast of Brutus. However, they alltake the oath as they were directed, and converting their sorrow intorage, follow Brutus as their leader, who from that time ceased not tosolicit them to abolish the regal power. They carry Lucretia's bodyfrom her own house, and convey it into the forum; and assemble a numberof persons by the strangeness and atrocity of the extraordinaryoccurrence, as usually happens. They complain, each for himself, of theroyal villany and violence. Both the grief of the father moves them, asalso Brutus, the reprover of their tears and unavailing complaints, andtheir adviser to take up arms against those who dared to treat them asenemies, as would become men and Romans. Each most spirited of the youthvoluntarily presents himself in arms; the rest of the youth follow also.From thence, after leaving an adequate garrison at the gates atCollatia, and having appointed sentinels, so that no one might giveintelligence of the disturbance to the king's party, the rest set outfor Rome in arms under the conduct of Brutus. When they arrived there,the armed multitude cause panic and confusion wherever they go. Again,when they see the principal men of the state placing themselves at theirhead, they think that, whatever it may be, it was not without goodreason. Nor does the heinousness of the circumstance excite less violentemotions at Rome than it had done at Collatia; accordingly they run fromall parts of the city into the forum, whither, when they came, thepublic crier summoned them to attend the tribune of the celeres, withwhich office Brutus happened to be at that time vested. There anharangue was delivered by him, by no means of that feeling and capacitywhich had been counterfeited up to that day, concerning the violence andlust of Sextus Tarquin, the horrid violation of Lucretia and herlamentable death, the bereavement of Tricipitinus, to whom the cause ofhis daughter's death was more exasperating and deplorable than the deathitself. To this was added the haughty insolence of the king himself, andthe sufferings and toils of the people, buried in the earth in cleansingsinks and sewers; that the Romans, the conquerors of all the surroundingstates, instead of warriors had become labourers and stone-cutters. Theunnatural murder of king Servius Tullius was dwelt on, and hisdaughter's driving over the body of her father in her impious chariot,and the gods who avenge parents were invoked by him. By stating theseand other, I suppose, more exasperating circumstances, which though byno means easily detailed by writers, the heinousness of the casesuggested at the time, he persuaded the multitude, already incensed, todeprive the king of his authority, and to order the banishment of L.Tarquin with his wife and children. He himself, having selected andarmed some of the young men, who readily gave in their names, set outfor Ardea to the camp to excite the army against the king: the commandin the city he leaves to Lucretius, who had been already appointedprefect of the city by the king. During this tumult Tullia fled from herhouse, both men and women cursing her wherever she went, and invoking onher the furies the avengers of parents."Book 1,Chapter 60,"News of these transactions having reached the camp, when the king,alarmed at this sudden revolution, was going to Rome to quell thecommotions, Brutus, for he had notice of his approach, turned out of theway, that he might not meet him; and much about the same time Brutus andTarquin arrived by different routes, the one at Ardea, the other atRome. The gates were shut against Tarquin, and an act of banishmentpassed against him; the deliverer of the state the camp received withgreat joy, and the king's sons were expelled. Two of them followed theirfather, and went into banishment to C¾re, a city of Etruria. SextusTarquin, having gone to Gabii, as to his own kingdom, was slain by theavengers of the old feuds, which he had raised against himself by hisrapines and murders. Lucius Tarquin the Proud reigned twenty-five years:the regal form of government continued from the building of the city tothis period of its deliverance, two hundred and forty-four years. Twoconsuls, viz. Lucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus,were elected by the prefect of the city at the comitia by centuries,according to the commentaries of Servius Tullius."Book 2,Chapter 1,"The affairs, civil and military, of the Roman people, henceforwardfree, their annual magistrates, and the sovereignty of the laws, morepowerful than that of men, I shall now detail.--The haughty insolence ofthe late king had caused this liberty to be the more welcome: for theformer kings reigned in such a manner that they all in succession mightbe not undeservedly set down as founders of the parts, at least of thecity, which they added as new residences for the population augmented bythemselves. Nor is there a doubt but that the very same Brutus whoearned so much glory for expelling this haughty monarch, would have doneso to the greatest injury of the public weal, if, through an over-hastydesire of liberty, he had wrested the kingdom from any of the precedingkings. For what would have been the consequence if that rabble ofshepherds and strangers, fugitives from their own countries, having,under the protection of an inviolable asylum, found liberty, or at leastimpunity, uncontrolled by the dread of regal authority, had begun to bedistracted by tribunician storms, and to engage in contests with thefathers in a strange city, before the pledges of wives and children, andlove of the very soil, to which it requires a length of time to becomehabituated, had united their affections. Their affairs not yet maturedwould have been destroyed by discord, which the tranquil moderation ofthe government so cherished, and by proper nourishment brought to suchperfection, that, their strength being now developed, they were able toproduce the wholesome fruits of liberty. But the origin of liberty youmay date from this period, rather because the consular authority wasmade annual, than that any diminution was made from the kinglyprerogative. The first consuls had all their privileges and ensigns ofauthority, only care was taken that the terror might not appear doubled,by both having the fasces at the same time. Brutus was, with the consentof his colleague, first attended by the fasces, who had not been a morezealous assertor of liberty than he was afterwards its guardian. Firstof all he bound over the people, whilst still enraptured with theirnewly-acquired liberty, by an oath that they would suffer no one to beking in Rome, lest afterwards they might be perverted by theimportunities or bribes of the royal family. Next in order, that thefulness of the house might produce more of strength in the senate, hefilled up the number of the senators, diminished by the king's murders,to the amount of three hundred, having elected the principal men of theequestrian rank; and from thence it is said the custom was derived ofsummoning into the senate both those who were patres and those who wereconscripti.[65] Forsooth they styled those who were elected into the newsenate Conscripti. It is wonderful how much that contributed to theconcord of the state, and to attach the affection of the commons to thepatricians."Book 2,Chapter 2,"Then attention was paid to religious matters, and as some part of thepublic worship had been performed by the kings in person, that theymight not be missed in any respect, they elect a king of the sacrifices.This office they made subject to the pontiff, that honour being added tothe name might be no infringement on their liberty, which was now theirprincipal care. And I know not whether by fencing it on every side toexcess, even in the most trivial matters, they may not have exceededbounds. For when there was nothing else to offend, the name of one ofthe consuls became an object of dislike to the state. ""That theTarquinii had been too much habituated to sovereignty; Priscus firstcommenced; that Servius Tullus reigned next; that though an intervalthus intervened, that Tarquinius Superbus, not losing sight of thekingdom as the property of another, had reclaimed it by crime andviolence, as the hereditary right of his family. That Superbus beingexpelled, the government was in the hands of Collatinus: that theTarquinii knew not how to live in a private station; the name pleasedthem not; that it was dangerous to liberty.""--Such discourses were atfirst gradually circulated through the entire state by persons soundingtheir dispositions; and the people, now excited by jealousy, Brutusconvenes to a meeting. There first of all he recites the people's oath:""that they would suffer no one to be king, nor any thing to be in Romewhence danger might result to liberty. That it ought to be maintainedwith all their might, and nothing that could tend that way ought to beoverlooked; he said it with reluctance, for the sake of the individual;and would not say it, did not his affection for the commonwealthpredominate; that the people of Rome do not believe that entire libertyhas been recovered; that the regal family, the regal name, was not onlyin the state but even in the government; that was unfavourable, that wasinjurious to liberty. Do you, L. Tarquinius,"" says he, ""do you, of yourown accord, remove this apprehension. We remember, we own it, youexpelled the royal family; complete your kindness; take hence the royalname--your property your fellow citizens shall not only restore you, bymy advice, but if any thing is wanting they will generously supply.Depart in amity. Relieve the state from a dread which is perhapsgroundless. So firmly are they persuaded in mind that only with theTarquinian race will kingly power depart hence."" Amazement at soextraordinary and sudden an occurrence at first impeded the consul'sutterance; then, when he was commencing to speak, the chief men of thestate stand around him, and by many importunities urge the same request.Others indeed had less weight with him. After Sp. Lucretius, superior inage and rank, his father-in-law besides, began to try various methods,by entreating and advising alternately, that he would suffer himself tobe prevailed on by the general feeling of the state, the consul,apprehending lest hereafter these same things might befall him, whenagain in a private station, together with loss of property and otheradditional disgrace, he resigned his consulship; and removing all hiseffects to Lavinium, he withdrew from the state.[66] Brutus, accordingto a decree of the senate, proposed to the people, that all the familyof the Tarquins should be banished from Rome; and in an assembly bycenturies he elected P. Valerius, with whose assistance he had expelledthe kings for his colleague."Book 2,Chapter 3,"Though nobody doubted that a war was impending from the Tarquins, yetit broke out later than was universally expected; but liberty was wellnigh lost by treachery and fraud, a thing they had never apprehended.There were, among the Roman youth, several young men of no meanfamilies, who, during the regal government, had pursued their pleasureswithout any restraint; being of the same age with, and companions of,the young Tarquins, and accustomed to live in princely style. Longingfor that licentiousness, now that the privileges of all were equalized,they complained that the liberty of others has been converted to theirslavery: ""that a king was a human being, from whom you can obtain, whereright, or where wrong may be necessary; that there was room for favourand for kindness; that he could be angry, and could forgive; that heknew the difference between a friend and an enemy; that laws were adeaf, inexorable thing, more beneficial and advantageous for the poorthan the rich; that they allowed of no relaxation or indulgence, if youtransgress bounds; that it was a perilous state, amid so so many humanerrors, to live solely by one's integrity."" Whilst their minds werealready thus discontented of their own accord, ambassadors from theroyal family come unexpectedly, demanding restitution of their effectsmerely, without any mention of return. After their application was heardin the senate, the deliberation on it lasted for several days, (fearing)lest the non-restitution might be a pretext for war, and the restitutiona fund and assistance for war. In the mean time the ambassadors wereplanning different schemes; openly demanding the property, they secretlyconcerted measures for recovering the throne, and soliciting them as iffor the object which appeared to be under consideration, they soundtheir feelings; to those by whom their proposals were favourablyreceived they give letters from the Tarquins, and confer with them aboutadmitting the royal family into the city secretly by night."Book 2,Chapter 4,"The matter was first intrusted to brothers of the name of Vitelliiand those of the name of Aquilii. A sister of the Vitellii had beenmarried to Brutus the consul, and the issue of that marriage were youngmen, Titus and Tiberius; these also their uncles admit into aparticipation of the plot: several young noblemen also were taken in asassociates, the memory of whose names has been lost from distance oftime. In the mean time, when that opinion had prevailed in the senate,which recommended the giving back of the property, and the ambassadorsmade use of this as a pretext for delay in the city, because they hadobtained from the consuls time to procure modes of conveyance, by whichthey might convey away the effects of the royal family; all this timethey spend in consulting with the conspirators, and by pressing theysucceed in having letters given to them for the Tarquins. For otherwisehow were they to believe that the accounts brought by the ambassadors onmatters of such importance were not idle? The letters, given to be apledge of their sincerity, discovered the plot; for when, the day beforethe ambassadors set out to the Tarquins, they had supped by chance atthe house of the Vitellii, and the conspirators there in privatediscoursed much together concerning their new design, as is natural, oneof the slaves, who had already perceived what was going on, overheardtheir conversation; but waited for the occasion when the letters shouldbe given to the ambassadors, the detection of which would prove thetransaction; when he perceived that they were given, he laid the wholeaffair before the consuls. The consuls, having left their home to seizethe ambassadors and conspirators, crushed the whole affair without anytumult; particular care being taken of the letters, lest they shouldescape them. The traitors being immediately thrown into chains, a littledoubt was entertained respecting the ambassadors, and though theydeserved to be considered as enemies, the law of nations howeverprevailed."Book 2,Chapter 5,"The question concerning the restitution of the tyrants' effects,which the senate had formerly voted, came again under consideration. Thefathers, fired with indignation, expressly forbad them either to berestored or confiscated. They were given to be rifled by the people,that after being made participators in the royal plunder, they mightlose for ever all hopes of a reconciliation with the Tarquins. A fieldbelonging to them, which lay between the city and the Tiber, having beenconsecrated to Mars, has been called the Campus Martius. It happenedthat there was a crop of corn upon it ready to be cut down, whichproduce of the field, as they thought it unlawful to use, after it wasreaped, a great number of men carried the corn and straw in baskets, andthrew them into the Tiber, which then flowed with shallow water, as isusual in the heat of summer; that thus the heaps of corn as it stuck inthe shallows became settled when covered over with mud: by these and theafflux of other things, which the river happened to bring thither, anisland was formed by degrees. Afterwards I believe that mounds wereadded, and that aid was afforded by art, that a surface so well raisedmight be firm enough for sustaining temples and porticoes. Afterplundering the tyrants' effects, the traitors were condemned and capitalpunishment inflicted. Their punishment was the more remarkable, becausethe consulship imposed on the father the office of punishing his ownchildren, and him who should have been removed as a spectator, fortuneassigned as the person to exact the punishment. Young men of the highestquality stood tied to a stake; but the consul's sons attracted the eyesof all the spectators from the rest of the criminals, as from personsunknown; nor did the people pity them more on account of the severity ofthe punishment, than the horrid crime by which they had deserved it.""That they, in that year particularly, should have brought themselves tobetray into the hands of Tarquin, formerly a proud tyrant, and now anexasperated exile, their country just delivered, their father itsdeliverer, the consulate which took its rise from the family of theJunii, the fathers, the people, and whatever belonged either to the godsor the citizens of Rome.""[67] The consuls seated themselves in theirtribunal, and the lictors, being despatched to inflict punishment, stripthem naked, beat them with rods, and strike off their heads. Whilstduring all this time, the father, his looks and his countenance,presented a touching spectacle,[68] the feelings of the father burstingforth occasionally during the office of superintending the publicexecution. Next after the punishment of the guilty, that there might bea striking example in either way for the prevention of crime, a sum ofmoney was granted out of the treasury as a reward to the discoverer;liberty also and the rights of citizenship were granted him. He is saidto have been the first person made free by the Vindicta; some think eventhat the term vindicta is derived from him. After him it was observed asa rule, that those who were set free in this manner were supposed to beadmitted to the rights of Roman citizens."Book 2,Chapter 6,"On these things being announced to him, as they had occurred,Tarquin, inflamed not only with grief for the frustration of such greathopes, but with hatred and resentment also, when he saw that the way wasblocked up against stratagem, considering that he should have recourseto war openly, went round as a suppliant to the cities of Etruria,""that they should not suffer him, sprung from themselves, of the sameblood, exiled and in want, lately in possession of so great a kingdom,to perish before their eyes, with the young men his sons. That othershad been invited to Rome from foreign lands to the throne; that he, aking, extending the Roman empire by his arms, was driven out by thosenearest to him by a villanous conspiracy; that they had by violencedivided the parts among themselves, because no one individual among themwas deemed sufficiently deserving of the kingdom; that they had given uphis effects to the people to be pillaged by them, that no one might befree from that guilt. That he was desirous to recover his country andhis kingdom, and to punish his ungrateful subjects. That they shouldbring succour and aid him; that they might also revenge the injuriesdone to them of old, their legions so often slaughtered, their landtaken from them."" These arguments prevailed on the people of Veii, andwith menaces they declare that now at least, under the conduct of aRoman general, their former disgrace should be wiped off, and what theyhad lost in war should be recovered. His name and relation to theminduced the people of Tarquinii to take part with him; it seemed anhonour that their countrymen should reign at Rome. Therefore the twoarmies of these two states followed Tarquin in order to recover hiskingdom, and to take vengeance upon the Romans. When they entered theRoman territories, the consuls marched to meet them. Valerius led up thefoot in a square battalion, and Brutus marched before with his horse toreconnoitre (the enemy). Their cavalry likewise came up first; Aruns,Tarquin's son, commanded it; the king himself followed with the legions.Aruns, when he knew at a distance by the lictors that it was a consul,and on coming nigher discovered for certain that it was Brutus by hisface, all inflamed with rage, he cried out, ""There is the villain whohas banished us from our native country! see how he rides in stateadorned with the ensigns of our dignity! now assist me, gods, theavengers of kings."" He put spurs to his horse and drove furiouslyagainst the consul. Brutus perceived the attack made on him; as it washonourable in these days for the generals to engage in combat, heeagerly offered himself to the combat. They encountered one another withsuch furious animosity, neither mindful of protecting his own person,provided he could wound his adversary; so that both, transfixed throughthe buckler by the blow from the opposite direction, fell lifeless fromtheir horses, entangled together by the two spears. The engagementbetween the rest of the horse commenced at the same time, and soon afterthe foot came up. There they fought with doubtful success, and as itwere with equal advantage, and the victory doubtful. The right wings ofboth armies were victorious and the left worsted. The Veientians,accustomed to be discomfited by the Roman soldiers, were routed and putto flight. The Tarquinienses, who were a new enemy, not only stood theirground, but even on their side obliged the Romans to give way."Book 2,Chapter 7,"After the issue of this battle, so great a terror seized Tarquin andthe Etrurians, that both the armies, the Veientian and Tarquinian,giving up the matter as impracticable, departed to their respectivehomes. They annex strange incidents to this battle,--that in the silenceof the next night a loud voice was emitted from the Arsian wood; that itwas believed to be the voice of Silvanus: these words were spoken, ""thatmore of the Etrurians by one[70] had fallen in the battle; that theRoman was victorious in the war."" Certainly the Romans departed thenceas victors, the Etrurians as vanquished. For as soon as it was light,and not one of the enemy was now to be seen, P. Valerius the consulcollected the spoils, and returned thence in triumph to Rome. Hiscolleague's funeral he celebrated with all the magnificence thenpossible. But a far greater honour to his death was the public sorrow,singularly remarkable in this particular, that the matrons mourned him ayear,[71] as a parent, because he had been so vigorous an avenger ofviolated chastity. Afterwards the consul who survived, so changeable arethe minds of the people, from great popularity, encountered not onlyjealousy, but suspicion, originating in an atrocious charge. Reportrepresented that he aspired to the crown, because he had not substituteda colleague in the room of Brutus, and was building a house on thesummit of Mount Velia, that there would be there an impregnable fortresson an elevated and well-fortified place. When these things, thuscirculated and believed, affected the consul's mind with indignation,having summoned the people to an assembly, he mounts the rostrum, afterlowering the fasces. It was a grateful sight to the multitude that theinsignia of authority were lowered to them, and that an acknowledgmentwas made, that the majesty and power of the people were greater thanthat of the consul. When they were called to silence, Valerius highlyextolled the good fortune of his colleague, ""who after delivering hiscountry had died vested with the supreme power, fighting bravely indefence of the commonwealth, when his glory was in its maturity, and notyet converted into jealousy. That he himself, having survived his glory,now remained as an object of accusation and calumny; that from theliberator of his country he had fallen to the level of the Aquilii andVitellii. Will no merit then, says he, ever be so tried and approved byyou, as to be exempted from the attacks of suspicion. Could I apprehendthat myself, the bitterest enemy of kings, should fall under the chargeof a desire of royalty? Could I believe that, even though I dwelt in thevery citadel and the Capitol, that I could be dreaded by my fellowcitizens? Does my character among you depend on so mere a trifle? Is myintegrity so slightly founded, that it makes more matter where I may be,than what I may be. The house of Publius Valerius shall not stand in theway of your liberty, Romans; the Velian mount shall be secure to you. Iwill not only bring down my house into the plain, but I will build itbeneath the hill, that you may dwell above me a suspected citizen. Letthose build on the Velian mount to whom liberty is more securelyintrusted than to P. Valerius."" Immediately all the materials werebrought down to the foot of the Velian mount, and the house was built atthe foot of the hill where the temple of Victory now stands."Book 2,Chapter 8,"After this laws were passed, which not only cleared him of allsuspicions of aiming at the regal power, but had so contrary a tendency,that they made him popular. From thence he was surnamed Poplicola. Aboveall, the laws regarding an appeal to the people against the magistrates,and that devoting the life and property of any one who should form adesign of assuming regal authority, were grateful to the people. Andafter he had passed these while sole consul, so that the merit in themwas exclusively his own, he then held an assembly for the election of anew colleague. Sp. Lucretius was elected consul, who being very old, andhis strength being inadequate to discharge the consular duties, dies ina few days. M. Horatius Pulvillus was substituted in the room ofLucretius. In some old writers I find no mention of Lucretius as consul;they place Horatius immediately after Brutus. I believe that, because noimportant event signalized his consulate, it has been unnoticed.Jupiter's temple in the Capitol had not yet been dedicated; the consulsValerius and Horatius cast lots which should dedicate it. It fell by lotto Horatius. Publicola departed to the war of the Veientians. Thefriends of Valerius were more annoyed than they should have been, thatthe dedication of so celebrated a temple should be given toHoratius.[72] Having endeavoured by every means to prevent that, whenall other attempts had been tried in vain, when the consul was nowholding the door-post during his offering of prayer to the gods, theysuddenly announce to him the shocking intelligence that his son wasdead, and that his family being defiled[73] he could not dedicate thetemple. Whether he did not believe the fact, or possessed such greatfirmness of mind, is neither handed down for certain, nor is aconjecture easy. Diverted from his purpose at this intelligence in noother way than to order that the body should be buried,[74] he goesthrough the prayer, and dedicates the temple. These were thetransactions at home and abroad the first year after the expulsion ofthe kings. After this P. Valerius, a second time, and Titus Lucretius,were elected consuls."Book 2,Chapter 9,"By this time the Tarquins had fled to Lars[75] Porsena, king ofClusium. There, mixing advice with their entreaties, ""They sometimesbesought him not to suffer them, who were descended from the Etrurians,and of the same blood and name, to live in exile and poverty; at othertimes they advised him not to let this commencing practice of expellingkings pass unpunished. That liberty has charms enough in itself; andunless kings defend their crowns with as much vigour as the peoplepursue their liberty, that the highest must be reduced to a level withthe lowest; there will be nothing exalted, nothing distinguished abovethe rest; and hence there must be an end of regal government, the mostbeautiful institution both among gods and men."" Porsena, thinking thatit would be an honour to the Tuscans both that there should be a king atRome, and especially one of the Etrurian nation, marched towards Romewith a hostile army. Never before on any other occasion did so greatterror seize the senate; so powerful was the state of Clusium at thetime, and so great the renown of Porsena. Nor did they only dread theirenemies, but even their own citizens, lest the common people, throughexcess of fear, should, by receiving the Tarquins into the city, acceptpeace even if purchased with slavery. Many conciliatory concessions weretherefore granted to the people by the senate during that period. Theirattention, in the first place, was directed to the markets, and personswere sent, some to the Volscians, others to Cum¾, to buy up corn. Theprivilege[76] of selling salt, also, because it was farmed at a highrent, was all taken into the hands of government,[77] and withdrawn fromprivate individuals; and the people were freed from port-duties andtaxes; that the rich, who were adequate to bearing the burden, shouldcontribute; that the poor paid tax enough if they educated theirchildren. This indulgent care of the fathers accordingly kept the wholestate in such concord amid the subsequent severities in the siege andfamine, that the highest abhorred the name of king not more than thelowest; nor was any single individual afterwards so popular byintriguing practices, as the whole senate then was by their excellentgovernment."Book 2,Chapter 10,"Some parts seemed secured by the walls, others by the interpositionof the Tiber. The Sublician bridge well nigh afforded a passage to theenemy, had there not been one man, Horatius Cocles, (that defence thefortune of Rome had on that day,) who, happening to be posted on guardat the bridge, when he saw the Janiculum taken by a sudden assault, andthat the enemy were pouring down from thence in full speed, and that hisown party, in terror and confusion, were abandoning their arms andranks, laying hold of them one by one, standing in their way, andappealing to the faith of gods and men, he declared, ""That their flightwould avail them nothing if they deserted their post; if they passed thebridge and left it behind them, there would soon be more of the enemy inthe Palatium and Capitol than in the Janiculum; for that reason headvised and charged them to demolish the bridge, by their sword, byfire, or by any means whatever; that he would stand the shock of theenemy as far as could be done by one man."" He then advances to the firstentrance of the bridge, and being easily distinguished among those whoshowed their backs in retreating from the fight, facing about to engagethe foe hand to hand, by his surprising bravery he terrified the enemy.Two indeed a sense of shame kept with him, Sp. Lartius and T. Herminius,men eminent for their birth, and renowned for their gallant exploits.With them he for a short time stood the first storm of the danger, andthe severest brunt of the battle. But as they who demolished the bridgecalled upon them to retire, he obliged them also to withdraw to a placeof safety on a small portion of the bridge still left. Then casting hisstern eyes round all the officers of the Etrurians in a threateningmanner, he sometimes challenged them singly, sometimes reproached themall; ""the slaves of haughty tyrants, who, regardless of their ownfreedom, came to oppress the liberty of others."" They hesitated for aconsiderable time, looking round one at the other, to commence thefight; shame then put the army in motion, and a shout being raised, theyhurl their weapons from all sides on their single adversary; and whenthey all stuck in the shield held before him, and he with no lessobstinacy kept possession of the bridge with firm step, they nowendeavoured to thrust him down from it by one push, when at once thecrash of the falling bridge, at the same time a shout of the Romansraised for joy at having completed their purpose, checked their ardourwith sudden panic. Then Cocles says, ""Holy father Tiberinus, I pray thatthou wouldst receive these arms, and this thy soldier, in thy propitiousstream."" Armed as he was, he leaped into the Tiber, and amid showers ofdarts hurled on him, swam across safe to his party, having dared an actwhich is likely to obtain more fame than credit with posterity. Thestate was grateful towards such valour; a statue was erected to him inthe comitium, and as much land was given to him as he ploughed around inone day. The zeal of private individuals also was conspicuous among thepublic honours. For, amid the great scarcity, each person contributedsomething to him according to his supply at home, depriving himself ofhis own support."Book 2,Chapter 11,"Porsena being repulsed in his first attempt, having changed hisplans from a siege to a blockade, after he had placed a garrison inJaniculum, pitched his camp in the plain and on the banks of the Tiber.Then sending for boats from all parts, both to guard the river, so asnot to suffer any provision to be conveyed to Rome, and also totransport his soldiers across the river, to plunder different places asoccasion required; in a short time he so harassed the entire countryround Rome, that not only every thing else from the country, but eventheir cattle, was driven into the city, and nobody durst venture thencewithout the gates. This liberty of action was granted to the Etrurians,not more through fear than from policy; for Valerius, intent on anopportunity of falling unawares upon a number of them, and whenstraggling, a remiss avenger in trifling matters, reserved the weight ofhis vengeance for more important occasions. Wherefore, to decoy thepillagers, he ordered his men to drive their cattle the next day out atthe Esquiline gate, which was farthest from the enemy, presuming thatthey would get intelligence of it, because during the blockade andfamine some slaves would turn traitors and desert. Accordingly they wereinformed of it by a deserter, and parties more numerous than usual, inhopes of seizing the entire body, crossed the river. Then P. Valeriuscommanded T. Herminius, with a small body of men, to lie concealed twomiles from the city, on the Gabian road, and Sp. Lartius, with a partyof light-armed troops, to post himself at the Colline gate till theenemy should pass by, and then to throw himself in their way so thatthere may be no return to the river. The other consul, T. Lucretius,marched out of the N¾vian gate with some companies of soldiers; Valeriushimself led some chosen cohorts down from the CÏlian mount, and theywere first descried by the enemy. Herminius, when he perceived thealarm, rose out of the ambush and fell upon the rear of the Tuscans, whohad charged Valerius. The shout was returned on the right and left, fromthe Colline gate on the one hand, and the N¾vian on the other. By thisstratagem the plunderers were put to the sword between both, they notbeing a match in strength for fighting, and all the ways being blockedup to prevent escape: this put an end to the Etrurians strolling aboutin so disorderly a manner."Book 2,Chapter 12,"Nevertheless the blockade continued, and there was a scarcity ofcorn, with a very high price. Porsena entertained a hope that bycontinuing the siege he should take the city, when C. Mucius, a youngnobleman, to whom it seemed a disgrace that the Roman people, whenenslaved under kings, had never been confined within their walls in anywar, nor by any enemy, should now when a free people be blocked up bythese very Etrurians whose armies they had often routed, thinking thatsuch indignity should be avenged by some great and daring effort, atfirst designed of his own accord to penetrate into the enemy's camp.Then, being afraid if he went without the permission of the consuls, orthe knowledge of any one, he might be seized by the Roman guards andbrought back as a deserter, the circumstances of the city at the timejustifying the charge, he went to the senate: ""Fathers,"" says he, ""Iintend to cross the Tiber, and enter the enemy's camp, if I can; not asa plunderer, or as an avenger in our turn of their devastations. Agreater deed is in in my mind, if the gods assist."" The senate approvedhis design. He set out with a sword concealed under his garment. When hecame thither, he stationed himself among the thickest of the crowd, nearthe king's tribunal. There, when the soldiers were receiving their pay,and the king's secretary sitting by him, dressed nearly in the samestyle, was busily engaged, and to him they commonly addressedthemselves, being afraid to ask which of them was Porsena, lest by notknowing the king he should discover on himself, as fortune blindlydirected the blow, he killed the secretary instead of the king. When, ashe was going off thence where with his bloody dagger he had made his waythrough the dismayed multitude, a concourse being attracted at thenoise, the king's guards immediately seized and brought him backstanding alone before the king's tribunal; even then, amid such menacesof fortune, more capable of inspiring dread than of feeling it, ""I am,""says he, ""a Roman citizen, my name is Caius Mucius; an enemy, I wishedto slay an enemy, nor have I less of resolution to suffer death than Ihad to inflict it. Both to act and to suffer with fortitude is a Roman'spart. Nor have I alone harboured such feelings towards you; there isafter me a long train of persons aspiring to the same honour. Therefore,if you choose it, prepare yourself for this peril, to contend for yourlife every hour; to have the sword and the enemy in the very entrance ofyour pavilion; this is the war which we the Roman youth declare againstyou; dread not an army in array, nor a battle; the affair will be toyourself alone and with each of us singly."" When the king, highlyincensed, and at the same time terrified at the danger, in a menacingmanner, commanded fires to be kindled about him, if he did not speedilyexplain the plots, which, by his threats, he had darkly insinuatedagainst him; Mucius said, ""Behold me, that you may be sensible of howlittle account the body is to those who have great glory in view;"" andimmediately he thrusts his right hand into the fire that was lighted forthe sacrifice. When he continued to broil it as if he had been quiteinsensible, the king, astonished at this surprising sight, after he hadleaped from his throne and commanded the young man to be removed fromthe altar, says, ""Be gone, having acted more like an enemy towardsthyself than me. I would encourage thee to persevere in thy valour, ifthat valour stood on the side of my country. I now dismiss you untouchedand unhurt, exempted from the right of war."" Then Mucius, as if making areturn for the kindness, says, ""Since bravery is honoured by you, sothat you have obtained by kindness that which you could not by threats,three hundred of us, the chief of the Roman youth, have conspired toattack you in this manner. It was my lot first. The rest will follow,each in his turn, according as the lot shall set him forward, unlessfortune shall afford an opportunity of you."""Book 2,Chapter 13,"Mucius being dismissed, to whom the cognomen of Sc¾vola wasafterwards given, from the loss of his right hand, ambassadors fromPorsena followed him to Rome. The risk of the first attempt, from whichnothing had saved him but the mistake of the assailant, and the risk tobe encountered so often in proportion to the number of conspirators,made so strong an impression upon him, that of his own accord he madepropositions of peace to the Romans. Mention was made to no purposeregarding the restoration of the Tarquinii to the throne, rather becausehe had been unable to refuse that to the Tarquinii, than from notknowing that it would be refused to him by the Romans. The condition ofrestoring their territory to the Veientians was obtained by him, and thenecessity of giving hostages in case they wished the garrison to bewithdrawn from the Janiculum was extorted from the Romans. Peace beingconcluded on these terms, Porsena drew his troops out of the Janiculum,and marched out of the Roman territories. The fathers gave Mucius, as areward of his valour, lands on the other side of the Tiber, which wereafterwards called the Mucian meadows. By this honour paid to valour thewomen were excited to merit public distinctions. As the camp of theEtrurians had been pitched not far from the banks of the Tiber, a younglady named Cl¾lia, one of the hostages, deceiving her keepers, swam overthe river, amidst the darts of the enemy, at the head of a troop ofvirgins, and brought them all safe to their relations. When the king wasinformed of this, at first highly incensed, he sent deputies to Rome todemand the hostage Cl¾lia; that he did not regard the others; andafterwards, being changed into admiration of her courage, he said, ""thatthis action surpassed those of Cocles and Mucius,"" and declared, ""as hewould consider the treaty as broken if the hostage were not deliveredup, so, if given up, he would send her back safe to her friends."" Bothsides kept their faith: the Romans restored their pledge of peaceaccording to treaty; and with the king of Etruria merit found not onlysecurity, but honour; and, after making encomiums on the young lady,promised to give her, as a present, half of the hostages, and that sheshould choose whom she pleased. When they were all brought out, she issaid to have pitched upon the young boys below puberty, which was bothconsonant to maiden delicacy, and by consent of the hostages themselvesit was deemed reasonable, that that age which was most exposed to injuryshould be freed from the enemy's hand. The peace being re-established,the Romans marked the uncommon instance of bravery in the woman, by anuncommon kind of honour, an equestrian statue; (the statue representing)a lady sitting on horseback was placed at the top of the Via Sacra."Book 2,Chapter 14,"Inconsistent with this so peaceful a departure of the Etrurian kingfrom the city, is the custom handed down from the ancients, and whichcontinues down to our times among other usages at public sales, (I mean)that of selling the goods of king Porsena; the origin[78] of whichcustom must either have occurred during the war, and was notrelinquished in peace, or it must have increased from a milder sourcethan the form of expression imports, of selling the goods in a hostilemanner. Of the accounts handed down, the most probable is, that Porsena,on retiring from the Janiculum, made a present to the Romans of his campwell stored with provisions conveyed from the neighbouring and fertilefields of Etruria, the city being then exhausted by the long siege; thatthis, lest it should be carried away in a hostile manner, by the peoplebeing admitted in, was then sold, and called the goods of Porsena, theexpression rather importing gratitude for the gift, than an auction ofthe king's property, which never even was in the power of the Romanpeople. Porsena, after ending the Roman war, that his army might notseem to have been led into these parts without effecting any thing, senthis son Aruns with a part of his forces to besiege Aricia. The matternot being expected, the Aricians were at first terrified; afterwardsassistance, which was sent for from the people of Latium and Cum¾,inspired so much hope, that they ventured to meet them in the field. Atthe commencement of the battle the Etrurians attacked the Aricians sofuriously, that they routed them at the first onset. But the Cumancohorts, opposing stratagem to force, moved off a little to one side,and when the enemy were carried beyond them in great disorder, theyfaced about and charged them in the rear. By this means the Etrurians,when they had almost got the victory, were enclosed and cut topieces.[79] A very small part of them, having lost their general,because they had no nearer refuge, came to Rome without their arms, inthe condition and with the air of suppliants. There they were kindlyreceived and provided with lodgings. When their wounds were cured, manyof them went home and told the kind hospitality they had met with.Affection for their hosts and for the city detained many at Rome; aplace was assigned them to dwell in, which they have ever since calledthe Tuscan Street."Book 2,Chapter 15,"Then P. Lucretius and P. Valerius Publicola were elected consuls.This year ambassadors came from Porsena for the last time, regarding therestoration of Tarquin to the throne. And when they were answered, thatthe senate would send deputies to the king; some of the principalpersons of that order were forthwith despatched to represent to him""that it was not because the answer could not have been given in a fewwords, that the royal family would not be received, that select membersof the senate had been deputed to him, rather than an answer given tohis ambassadors at Rome; but (it was done) that all mention of thematter might be put an end to for evermore, and that their minds mightnot be disturbed amid so many mutual acts of kindness, by his requiringwhat was adverse to the liberty of the Roman people, and by theirdenying to him to whom they would willingly deny nothing, unless theywould submit to their own ruin. That the Roman people were not now undera kingly government, but in a state of freedom, and were firmlydetermined rather to open their gates to enemies than to kings. That itwas the wish of all, that their city might have the same period ofexistence as their freedom in that city. Wherefore, if he wished Rome tobe safe, they entreated that he would suffer it to be free."" The king,overcome by modesty, says, ""Since it is your firm and fixed resolve, Iwill neither tease you by repeatedly urging these same subjects morefrequently, nor will I disappoint the Tarquinii by holding out hopes ofaid which it is not in my power to give them; whether they have need ofpeace, or of war, let them seek another place from here for their exile,that nothing may disturb the peace between you and me."" To these kindpromises he added actions still more friendly, for he delivered up theremainder of the hostages, and restored to them the land of theVeientians, which had been taken from them by the treaty concluded atJaniculum. Tarquin, all hopes of return being now cut off, went toTusculum to live in exile with his son-in-law Mamilius Octavius. Thusthe peace between Porsena and the Romans was inviolably preserved."Book 2,Chapter 16,"M. Valerius and P. Posthumius were chosen consuls. This year war wascarried on successfully against the Sabines; the consuls received thehonour of a triumph. Upon this the Sabines made preparations for war ona larger scale. To make head against them, and lest any sudden dangermight arise from Tusculum, (whence they suspected a war, though it wasnot yet declared,) P. Valerius was created consul a fourth time, and T.Lucretius a second time. A disturbance arising among the Sabines,between the advisers of war and of peace, transferred from thence someadditional strength to the Romans. For Attus Clausus, afterwards calledat Rome Appius Claudius, when he himself, being an adviser of peace, washard put to it by those who abetted the war, and was not a match for thefaction, fled from Regillum to Rome, accompanied by a great number ofclients. The rights of citizenship and land on the other side of theAnio were conferred on them. It was called the old Claudian tribe, andwas increased by the addition of some tribesmen who had come from thatcountry. Appius, being chosen into the senate, was soon after advanced,to the highest dignity of that order. The consuls having entered theterritories of the Sabines with a hostile army, after they had, both bylaying waste their country, and afterwards by defeating them in battle,so weakened the power of the enemy, that they had no reason to dreadtheir taking up arms again for a long time, returned to Rome in triumph.The following year, Agrippa Menenius and P. Posthumius being consuls, P.Valerius, allowed by universal consent to be the ablest man in Rome, inthe arts both of peace and war, died in the height of glory, but sopoor, that means to defray the expenses of his funeral were wanting: hewas buried at the public charge. The matrons mourned for him as they haddone for Brutus. The same year two Latin colonies, Pometia and Cora,revolted to the Auruncians. War was commenced against the Auruncians,and after defeating a numerous army of them who boldly met the consulsentering their frontiers, the whole Auruncian war was confined toPometia. Nor, after the battle was over, did they refrain from slaughtermore than in the heat of the action; for a greater number were slainthan taken, and the prisoners they put to death indiscriminately. Nordid the enemy, in their resentment, spare even the three hundredhostages which they had received. This year also the consuls triumphedat Rome."Book 2,Chapter 17,"The following consuls, Opiter Virginius and Sp. Cassius, firstendeavoured to take Pometia by storm, and afterwards by raising vine¾and other works. But the Auruncians, prompted more by an irreconcilablehatred against them, than induced by hopes of success, or by afavourable opportunity, sallied out of the town, and though more of themwere armed with lighted torches than swords, filled all places with fireand slaughter. After they had burnt down the vine¾, slain and woundedmany of the enemy, they were near killing one of the consuls, who hadbeen thrown from his horse and severely wounded (which of them authorsdo not mention). Upon this they returned to Rome, foiled in theirobject; the consul was left among many more who were wounded with veryuncertain hopes of his recovery. After a short time, sufficient forcuring their wounds and recruiting their army, they marched againstPometia with redoubled fury and augmented strength. When, the vine¾having been repaired and the other apparatus of war, the soldiers wereon the point of scaling the walls, the town surrendered. Yet though thetown had surrendered, the leading men of the Auruncians, with no lesscruelty than if it had been taken by assault, were beheadedindiscriminately; the others who were colonists were sold by auction,the town was razed, and the land sold. The consuls obtained a triumphmore from having severely gratified their revenge, than in consequenceof the importance of the war thus brought to a close."Book 2,Chapter 18,"The following year had Postumus Cominius and T. Lartius for consuls.On this year, during the celebration of the games at Rome, as some ofthe courtesans were being carried off by some of the Sabine youth in afrolic, a mob having assembled, a scuffle ensued, and almost a battle;and from this inconsiderable affair the whole nation seemed inclined toa renewal of hostilities. Besides the dread of the Latin war, thisaccession was further made to their fears; certain intelligence wasreceived that thirty different states had entered into a confederacyagainst them, at the instigation of Octavius Mamilius. While the citywas perplexed amid this expectation of such important events, mentionwas made for the first time of nominating a dictator. But in what yearor who the consuls[80] were in whom confidence was not reposed, becausethey were of the Tarquinian faction, (for that also is recorded,) or whowas elected dictator for the first time, is not satisfactorilyestablished. Among the oldest writers however I find that Titus Lartiuswas appointed the first dictator, and Spurius Cassius master of thehorse. They chose men of consular dignity, for so the law, made for theelection of a dictator, ordained. For this reason, I am more inclined tobelieve that Lartius, who was of consular rank, was annexed to theconsuls as their director and master, rather than Manius Valerius, theson of Marcus and grandson of Volesus, who had not yet been consul. For,had they intended to choose a dictator from that family in particular,they would much rather have chosen his father, Marcus Valerius, aconsular person, and a man of distinguished merit. On the creation ofthe dictator first at Rome, when they saw the axes carried before him,great awe struck the common people, so that they became more submissiveto obey orders. For neither was there now, as under the consuls whopossessed equal power, the assistance of one of the two, nor was thereappeal, nor was there any resource any where but in attentivesubmission. The creation of a dictator at Rome terrified the Sabines,and the more effectually, because they thought he was created on theiraccount.[81] Wherefore they sent ambassadors to sue for peace, to whom,when earnestly entreating the dictator and senate to pardon the youngmen's offence, an answer was given that the young men could easily beforgiven, but not the old men, who continually raised one war afteranother. Nevertheless they continued to treat about a peace, and itwould have been granted, if the Sabines would bring themselves to makegood the expenses incurred on the war (for that was demanded). War wasproclaimed; a tacit truce kept the year quiet."Book 2,Chapter 19,"Servius Sulpicius and M. Tullius were consuls the next year: nothingworth mentioning happened. Then T. ®butius and C. Vetusius. In theirconsulship, Fiden¾ was besieged, Crustumeria taken, and Pr¾nesterevolted from the Latins to the Romans. Nor was the Latin war, which hadbeen fomenting for several years, any longer deferred. A. Postumiusdictator, and T. ®butius his master of the horse, marching with anumerous army of horse and foot, met the enemy's forces at the lakeRegillus, in the territory of Tusculum, and, because it was heard thatthe Tarquins were in the army of the Latins, their rage could not berestrained, but they must immediately come to an engagement. Accordinglythe battle was more obstinate and fierce than usual. For the generalswere present not only to direct matters by their orders, but evencharged one another, exposing their own persons. And there was hardlyany of the principal officers of either side who came off unwoundedexcept the Roman dictator. As Postumius was drawing up his men andencouraging them in the first line, Tarquinius Superbus, though nowenfeebled by age, spurred on his horse with great fury to attack him;but being wounded in the side, he was carried off by a party of his ownmen to a place of safety. In the other wing also, ®butius, master of thehorse, had charged Octavius Mamilius; nor was his approach unobserved bythe Tusculan general, who also briskly spurred on his horse to encounterhim. And such was their impetuosity as they advanced with hostilespears, that ®butius was run through the arm and Mamilius struck on thebreast. The Latins received the latter into their second line; but as®butius was not able to wield his lance with his wounded arm, he retiredfrom the battle. The Latin general, not in the least discouraged by hiswound, stirs up the fight; and because he saw his own men begin to giveground, sent for a company of Roman exiles to support them, commanded byTarquin's son. This body, inasmuch as they fought with greater fury fromhaving been banished from their country, and lost their estates,restored the battle for a short time."Book 2,Chapter 20,"When the Romans were beginning to give ground on that side, M.Valerius, brother to Poplicola, having observed young Tarquin boldlyfiguring away at the head of his exiles, fired with the renown of hisfamily, that the slaying of the princes might belong to the same familywhose glory their expulsion had been, clapped spurs to his horse, andwith his javelin presented made towards Tarquin. Tarquin retired fromhis violent enemy into a battalion of his own men. As Valerius rushedrashly into the line of the exiles, one of them ran him sideways throughthe body, and as the horse was in no way retarded by the wound of hisrider, the expiring Roman fell to the ground, his arms falling over him.Postumius the dictator, on seeing so distinguished a man slain, theexiles advancing boldly in a body, and his own men disheartened andgiving ground, gives the signal to his own cohort, a chosen body of menwhich he kept for the defence of his person, to treat every Romansoldier whom they should see fly from the battle as an enemy. Upon thisthe Romans, by reason of the danger on both sides, turned from theirflight against the enemy, and, the battle being restored, the dictator'scohort now for the first time engaged in the fight, and with freshvigour and undaunted resolution falling on the wearied exiles, cut themto pieces. Here another engagement took place between the leadingofficers. The Latin general, on seeing the cohort of the exiles almostsurrounded by the Roman dictator, advanced in haste to the front withsome companies of the body of reserve. T. Herminius, alieutenant-general, having seen them moving in a body, and well knowingMamilius, distinguished from the rest by his armour and dress,encountered the leader of the enemy with a force so much superior tothat wherewith the general of the horse had lately done, that at onethrust he ran him through the side and slew him; and while strippingthe body of his enemy, he himself received a wound with a javelin; andthough brought back to the camp victorious, yet he died during the firstdressing of it. Then the dictator flies to the cavalry, entreating themin the most pressing terms, as the foot were tired out with fighting, todismount from their horses and join the fight. They obeyed his orders,dismounted, flew to the front, and taking their post at the first line,cover themselves with their targets. The infantry immediately recoveredcourage, when they saw the young noblemen sustaining a share of thedanger with them, the mode of fighting being now assimilated. Thus atlength were the Latins beaten back, and their line giving way,[82] theyretreated. The horses were then brought up to the cavalry that theymight pursue the enemy, and the infantry likewise followed. On this, thedictator, omitting nothing (that could conciliate) divine or human aid,is said to have vowed a temple to Castor, and likewise to have promisedrewards to the first and second of the soldiers who should enter theenemy's camp. And such was their ardour, that the Romans took the campwith the same impetuosity wherewith they had routed the enemy in thefield. Such was the engagement at the lake Regillus. The dictator andmaster of the horse returned to the city in triumph."Book 2,Chapter 21,"For the next three years there was neither settled peace nor openwar. The consuls were Q. Cl¾lius and T. Lartius. After them A.Sempronius and M. Minucius. In their consulship, a temple was dedicatedto Saturn, and the Saturnalia appointed to be kept as a festival. ThenA. Postumius and T. Virginius were chosen consuls. In some authors Ifind that the battle at the lake Regillus was not fought till this year,and that A. Postumius, because the fidelity of his colleague wassuspected, laid down his office, and thereupon was created dictator.Such great mistakes of dates perplex one with the history of thesetimes, the magistrates being arranged differently in different writers,that you cannot determine what consuls succeeded certain consuls,[83]nor in what particular year every remarkable action happened, by reasonof the antiquity, not only of the facts, but also of the historians.Then Ap. Claudius and P. Servilius were elected consuls. This year wasremarkable for the news of Tarquin's death. He died at Cum¾, whither hehad fled to the tyrant Aristodemus, after the reduction of the power ofthe Latins. The senate and people were elated by this news. But with thesenators their satisfaction was too extravagant, for by the chief menamong them oppression began to be practised on the people to whom theyhad to that day been attentive to the utmost of their power. The sameyear the colony which king Tarquin had sent to Signia was recruited byfilling up the number of the colonists. The tribes at Rome wereincreased to twenty-one. And the temple of Mercury was dedicated thefifteenth of May."Book 2,Chapter 22,"During the Latin war, there had been neither peace nor war with thenation of the Volscians; for both the Volscians had raised auxiliarytroops to send to the Latins had not so much expedition been used by theRoman dictator, and the Roman employed this expedition that he might nothave to contend in one and the same battle with the Latin and theVolscian. In resentment of this, the consuls marched their army into theVolscian territory; the unexpected proceeding alarmed the Volscians, whodreaded no chastisement of mere intention; unmindful of arms, they gavethree hundred children of the principal men of Cora and Pometia ashostages. Upon this the legions were withdrawn without coming to anyaction. Not long after their natural disposition returned to theVolscians, now delivered of their fears; they again make secretpreparation for war, having taken the Hernicians into an alliance withthem. They send ambassadors in every direction to stir up Latium. Butthe recent defeat received at the lake Regillus, could scarcely restrainthe Latins from offering violence to the ambassadors through resentmentand hatred of any one who would advise them to take up arms. Havingseized the Volscians, they brought them to Rome. They were theredelivered up to the consuls, and information was given that theVolscians and Hernicians were making preparations for war against theRomans. The matter being referred to the senate, it was so gratifying tothe senators that they both sent back six thousand prisoners to theLatins, and referred to the new magistrates the business regarding thetreaty, which had been almost absolutely refused them. Upon this indeedthe Latins were heartily glad at what they had done, the advisers ofpeace were in high esteem. They send a crown of gold to the Capitol asan offering to Jupiter. Along with the ambassadors and the offeringthere came a great crowd, consisting of the prisoners who had been sentback to their friends. They proceed to the houses of those persons withwhom each had been in servitude, and return thanks for their having beengenerously kept and treated during their calamity. They then formconnexions of hospitality. And never at any former time was the Latinname more closely united to the Roman state, either by public or privateties."Book 2,Chapter 23,"But both the Volscian war was threatening, and the state, beingdisturbed within itself, glowed with intestine animosity between thesenate and people, chiefly on account of those confined for debt. Theycomplained loudly, that whilst fighting abroad for liberty and dominion,they were captured and oppressed at home by their fellow citizens; andthat the liberty of the people was more secure in war than in peace,among enemies than among their fellow citizens; and this feeling ofdiscontent, increasing of itself, the striking sufferings of anindividual still further aggravated. A certain person advanced in yearsthrew himself into the forum with all the badges of his miseries on him.His clothes were all over squalid, the figure of his body still moreshocking, being pale and emaciated. In addition, a long beard and hairhad impressed a savage wildness on his countenance; in such wretchednesshe was known notwithstanding, and they said that he had been acenturion, and compassionating him they mentioned openly otherdistinctions (obtained) in the service: he himself exhibited scars onhis breast, testimonies of honourable battles in several places. Topersons repeatedly inquiring, whence that garb, whence that ghastlyappearance of body, (the multitude having now assembled around himalmost like a popular assembly,) he says, ""that whilst serving in theSabine war, because he had not only been deprived of the produce of hisland in consequence of the depredations of the enemy, but also hisresidence had been burned down, all his effects pillaged, his cattledriven off, a tax imposed on him at a time very distressing to him, hehad incurred debt; that this debt, aggravated by usury, had strippedhim first of his father's and grandfather's farm, then of his otherproperty; lastly that a pestilence, as it were, had reached his person.That he was taken by his creditor, not into servitude, but into a houseof correction and a place of execution."" He then showed his backdisfigured with the marks of stripes still recent. At the hearing andseeing of this a great uproar takes place. The tumult is now no longerconfined to the forum, but spreads through the entire city. Those whowere confined for debt, and those who were now at their liberty, hurryinto the streets from all quarters and implore the protection of thepeople. In no place is there wanting a voluntary associate of sedition.They run through all the streets in crowds to the forum with loudshouts. Such of the senators as happened to be in the forum, fell inwith this mob with great peril to themselves; nor would they haverefrained from violence, had not the consuls, P. Servilius and Ap.Claudius, hastily interfered to quell the disturbance. The multitudeturning towards them, and showing their chains and other marks ofwretchedness, said that they deserved all this, taunting them (theconsuls) each with the military services performed by himself, one inone place, and another in another. They require them with menaces,rather than as suppliants, to assemble the senate, and stand round thesenate-house in a body, determined themselves to be witnesses anddirectors of the public counsels. Very few of the senators, whom chancehad thrown in the way, were forced to attend the consuls; fear preventedthe rest from coming not only to the house, but even to the forum. Norcould any thing be done by reason of the thinness of the senate. Thenindeed the people began to think their demand was eluded, and theredress of their grievances delayed; that such of the senators as hadabsented themselves did so not through chance or fear, but on purpose toobstruct the business. That the consuls themselves trifled with them,that their miseries were now a mere subject of mockery. By this time thesedition was come to such a height, that the majesty of the consulscould hardly restrain the violence of the people. Wherefore, uncertainwhether they incurred greater danger by staying at home, or venturingabroad, they came at length to the senate; but though the house was atlength full, a want of agreement manifested itself, not only among thefathers, but even between the consuls themselves. Appius, a man ofviolent temper, thought the matter was to be done by the authority ofthe consuls, and that if one or two were seized, the rest would bequiet. Servilius, more inclined to moderate measures, thought that whiletheir minds were in this ferment, it would be both more safe and moreeasy to bend than to break them. Amidst these debates, another terror ofa more serious nature presented itself."Book 2,Chapter 24,"Some Latin horse came full speed to Rome, with the alarming newsthat the Volscians were marching with a hostile army, to besiege thecity, the announcement of which (so completely had discord made thestate two from one) affected the senators and people in a far differentmanner. The people exulted with joy, and said, that the gods were comeas avengers of the tyranny of the fathers. They encouraged one anothernot to enrol their names, that it was better that all should perishtogether, than that they should perish alone. That the patricians shouldserve as soldiers, that the patricians should take up arms, so that theperils of war should remain with those with whom the advantages were.But the senate, dejected and confounded by the two-fold terror, thatfrom their own countrymen, and that from the enemy, entreated the consulServilius, whose temper was more conciliating, that he would extricatethe commonwealth beset with such great terrors. Then the consul,dismissing the senate, proceeds into the assembly. There he shows themthat the senate were solicitous that care should be taken for thepeople's interest: but their alarm for the whole commonwealth hadinterrupted their deliberation regarding that which was no doubt thegreatest part, but yet only a part; nor could they, when the enemy werealmost at the gates, allow any thing to take precedence of war: nor, ifthere should be some respite, was it either to the credit of the peoplenot to have taken up arms in defence of their country unless they firstreceive a recompence, nor consistent with the dignity of the senatorsthat they adopted measures of relief for the distresses of theircountrymen through fear rather than afterwards from inclination. He gaveadditional confidence to the assembly by an edict, by which he ordainedthat no one ""should detain a Roman citizen either in chains or inprison, so as to hinder his enrolling his name under the consuls. Andthat nobody should either seize or sell the goods of any soldier, whilehe was in the camp, or arrest his children or grandchildren."" Thisordinance being published, the debtors under arrest who were presentimmediately entered their names, and crowds of persons hastening fromall quarters of the city from their confinement, as their creditors hadno right to detain their persons, ran together into the forum to takethe military oath. These made up a considerable body of men, nor was thebravery or activity of the others more conspicuous in the Volscian war.The consul led out his army against the enemy, and pitched his camp at alittle distance from them."Book 2,Chapter 25,"The next night the Volscians, relying on the dissension among theRomans, made an attempt on their camp, to see if any desertion ortreachery might be resorted to during the night. The sentinels on guardperceived them; the army was called up, and the signal being given theyran to arms. Thus that attempt of the Volscians was frustrated; theremainder of the night was dedicated to repose on both sides. The nextmorning at daybreak the Volscians, having filled the trenches, attackedthe rampart. And already the fortifications were being demolished onevery side, when the consul, although all on every side, and moreespecially the debtors, cried out that he should give the signal, havingdelayed a little while for the purpose of trying the feelings of thesoldiers, when their great ardour became sufficiently apparent, havingat length given the signal for sallying forth, he lets out the soldiersnow impatient for the fight. At the very first onset the enemy wererouted; the rear of them who fled was harassed, as long as the infantrywas able to overtake them; the cavalry drove them in consternation totheir very camp. In a little time the camp itself was taken andplundered, the legions having surrounded it, as the panic had driven theVolscians even from thence also. On the next day the legions being ledto Suessa Pometia, whither the enemy had retreated, in a few days thetown is taken; when taken, it was given up for plunder: by these meansthe needy soldiers were somewhat relieved. The consul leads back hisvictorious army to Rome with the greatest glory to himself: as he issetting out for Rome, the deputies of the Ecetrans, (a part) of theVolscians, alarmed for their state after the taking of Pometia, come tohim. By a decree of the senate peace is granted them, but their land istaken from them."Book 2,Chapter 26,"Immediately after the Sabines also caused an alarm to the Romans;but it was rather a tumult than a war. It was announced in the cityduring the night that a Sabine army had advanced as far as the riverAnio, plundering the country: that the country houses there werepillaged and burnt down indiscriminately. A. Postumius, who had beendictator in the Latin war, was immediately sent against them with allthe horse. The consul Servilius followed him with a chosen body of foot.The cavalry cut off most of the stragglers; nor did the Sabine legionmake any resistance against the foot when they came up with them. Beingtired both by their march and their plundering the country in the night,and a great number of them being surfeited with eating and drinking inthe cottages, they had scarcely sufficient strength for flight. TheSabine war being thus heard of and finished in one night, on thefollowing day, amid sanguine hope of peace being secured in everyquarter, ambassadors from the Auruncians come to the senate, proclaimingwar unless the troops are withdrawn from the Volscian territory. Thearmy of the Auruncians had set out from home simultaneously with theambassadors; the report of which having been seen not far from Aricia,excited such a tumult among the Romans, that neither the senate could beconsulted in regular form, nor could they, while themselves taking uparms, give a pacific answer to those advancing against them in arms.They march to Aricia with a determined army, come to an engagement notfar from thence, and in one battle put an end to the war."Book 2,Chapter 27,"After the defeat of the Auruncians, the people of Rome, victoriousin so many wars within a few days, were expecting the promises of theconsul and the engagement of the senate (to be made good). But Appius,both through his natural pride, and in order to undermine the credit ofhis colleague, issued his decrees regarding borrowed money, with allpossible severity. And from this time, both those who had been formerlyin confinement were delivered up to their creditors, and others alsowere taken into custody. When this happened to a soldier, he appealed tothe colleague, and a crowd gathered about Servilius: they represented tohim his promises, severally upbraided him with their services in war,and with the scars they had received. They loudly called upon him to laythe matter before the senate, and that, as consul, he would relieve hisfellow citizens, as a general, his soldiers. These remonstrancesaffected the consul, but the situation of affairs obliged him to backout; so completely had not only his colleague, but the whole body of thepatricians, adopted an entirely opposite course. And thus, by acting amiddle part, he neither escaped the odium of the people, nor gained thefavour of the senators. The fathers looked upon him as a weak,popularity-hunting consul, and the people considered him as a deceiver.And it soon appeared that he was as odious to them as Appius himself. Adispute had happened between the consuls, as to which should dedicatethe temple of Mercury. The senate referred the affair from themselves tothe people, and ordained that to whichsoever of them the dedicationshould be granted by order of the people, he should preside over themarkets, establish a company of merchants, and perform the functions ofa pontifex maximus. The people gave the dedication of the temple to M.L¾torius, the centurion of the first legion, that it might plainlyappear to have been done not so much out of respect to a person on whoman honour above his rank had been conferred, as to affront the consuls.Upon this one of the consuls particularly, and the senators, were highlyincensed. But the people had acquired courage, and proceeded in a mannerquite different from what they had at first intended. For when theydespaired of redress from the consuls and senate, upon seeing a debtorled to the court, they flew together from all quarters. And neither thedecree of the consul could be heard in consequence of the noise andclamour, nor, when he had pronounced the decree, did any one obey it.All was managed by violence, and the entire dread and danger withrespect to personal liberty, was transferred from the debtors to thecreditors, who were severally abused by the crowd in the very sight ofthe consul. In addition to all this, the dread of the Sabine war spread,and when a levy was decreed, nobody gave in his name; Appius beingenraged, and bitterly inveighing against the ambitious arts of hiscolleague, who by his popular silence was betraying the republic, andbesides his not passing sentence against the debtors, likewise neglectedto raise the levies, after they had been voted by the senate. Yet hedeclared, that ""the commonwealth was not entirely deserted, nor theconsular authority altogether debased. That he alone would vindicateboth his own dignity and that of the senators."" When a daily mob,emboldened by licentiousness, stood round him, he commanded a notedringleader of the sedition to be apprehended. He, as the lictors werecarrying him off, appealed to the people; nor would the consul haveallowed the appeal, because there was no doubt regarding the judgment ofthe people, had not his obstinacy been with difficulty overcome, ratherby the advice and influence of the leading men, than by the clamours ofthe people; so much resolution he had to bear the weight of their odium.The evil gained ground daily, not only by open clamours, but, which wasfar more dangerous, by a secession and by secret meetings. At length theconsuls, so odious to the commons, went out of office: Servilius likedby neither party, Appius highly esteemed by the senators."Book 2,Chapter 28,"Then A. Virginius and T. Vetusius enter on the consulship. Upon thisthe commons, uncertain what sort of consuls they were to have, heldnightly meetings, some of them upon the Esquiline, and others upon theAventine hill, that they might not be confused by hasty resolutions inthe forum, or take their measures inconsiderately and without concert.The consuls, judging this proceeding to be of dangerous tendency, as itreally was, laid the matter before the senate. But they were not allowedafter proposing it to take the votes regularly; so tumultuously was itreceived on all sides by the clamours and indignation of the fathers, atthe consuls throwing on the senate the odium of that which should havebeen put down by consular authority. ""That if there really weremagistrates in the republic, there would have been no council in Romebut the public one. That the republic was now divided and split into athousand senate-houses and assemblies, some of which were held on theEsquiline, others on the Aventine hill. That one man, in truth such asAppius Claudius, for that that was more than a consul, would in a momentdisperse these private meetings."" When the consuls, thus rebuked, askedthem, ""What they desired them to do, for that they would act with asmuch energy and vigour as the senators wished,"" they resolve that theyshould push on the levies as briskly as possible, that the people werebecome insolent from want of employment. When the house broke up, theconsuls ascend the tribunal and summon the young men by name. But noneof them made any answer, and the people crowding round them, as if in ageneral assembly, said, ""That the people would no longer be imposed on.They should never list one soldier till the public faith was made good.That liberty should be restored to each before arms were given, thatthey might fight for their country and fellow citizens, and not forarbitrary lords."" The consuls fully understood the orders they hadreceived from the senate, but they saw none of those who had talked sobig within the walls of the senate-house present themselves to take anyshare with them in the public odium. A desperate contest with thecommons seemed at hand. Therefore, before they would have recourse toextremities, they thought it advisable to consult the senate a secondtime. Then indeed the younger senators flocked in a hurry round thechairs of the consuls, commanding them to abdicate the consulate, andresign an office which they had not courage to support."Book 2,Chapter 29,"Having sufficiently tried both[84] ways, the consuls at length said,""Conscript fathers, lest you may say that you were not forewarned, agreat disturbance is at hand. We require that they who accuse us mostseverely of cowardice, would assist us in raising the levies; we shallproceed according to the resolution of the most intrepid amongst you,since it so pleases you."" They return to their tribunal, and on purposecommanded one of the most factious of the people, who stood in theirview, to be called upon by name. When he stood mute, and a number of menstood round him in a ring, to prevent his being seized, the consuls senta lictor to him. He being repulsed, such of the fathers as attended theconsuls, exclaiming against it as an intolerable insult, ran in a hurryfrom the tribunal to assist the lictor. But when the violence was turnedfrom the lictor, who suffered nothing else but being prevented fromseizing him, against the fathers, the riot was quelled by theinterposition of the consuls, in which however, without stones orweapons, there was more noise and angry words than mischief done. Thesenate, called in a tumultuous manner, is consulted in a manner stillmore tumultuous; such as had been beaten, calling out for an inquiry,and the most violent members declaring their sentiments no less byclamours and noise than by their votes. At length, when their passionhad subsided, the consuls reproaching them with there being as muchdisorderly conduct in the senate as in the forum, the house began tovote in regular order. There were three different opinions: P. Virginiusdid not make the [85]matter general. He voted that they should consideronly those who, relying on the promise of P. Servilius the consul, hadserved in a war against the Auruncans and Sabines. Titius Largius was ofopinion, ""That it was not now a proper time to reward services only.That all the people were immersed in debt, and that a stop could not beput to the evil, unless measures were adopted for all. And that if thecondition of different parties be different, the divisions would ratherbe thereby inflamed than composed."" Appius Claudius, who was naturallysevere, and, by the hatred of the commons on the one hand, and praisesof the senators on the other, was become quite infuriated, said, ""Thatthese riots proceeded not from distress, but from licentiousness. Thatthe people were rather wanton than violent. That this terrible mischieftook its rise from the right of appeal; since threats, not authority,was all that belonged to the consuls, while permission was given toappeal to those who were accomplices in the crime. Come,"" added he, ""letus create a dictator from whom there lies no appeal; this madness, whichhath set every thing in a flame, will immediately subside. Let any onedare then to strike a lictor, when he shall know that his back, and evenhis life, are in the power of that person whose authority he hasinsulted."""Book 2,Chapter 30,"To many the opinion of Appius appeared, as it really was, severe andviolent. On the other hand, those of Virginius and Largius were not safefor the precedent they established; especially they thought that ofLargius so, as it would destroy all credit. The opinion of Virginius wasreckoned to be most moderate, and a happy medium between the other two.But through the spirit of faction and a regard of private interest,which always have and always will obstruct the public councils, Appiusprevailed, and was himself near being created dictator; which step wouldcertainly have alienated the commons at this most dangerous juncture,when the Volsci, the ®qui, and the Sabines happened to be all in arms atthe same time. But the consuls and elder senators took care that thisoffice, in its own nature uncontrollable, should be committed to a manof moderate temper. They choose Manius Valerius, son of Volesus,dictator. The people, though they saw that this magistrate was createdagainst themselves, yet as they had got the right of appeal by hisbrother's law, dreaded nothing oppressive or tyrannical from thatfamily. An edict of the dictator's, which was almost the same with thatpublished by the consul Servilius, afterwards confirmed their minds. Butjudging it safer to confide in both the man and in the absolute powerwith which he was vested, they gave in their names, desisting from allcontest. Ten legions were levied, a greater army than had ever beenraised before. Each of the consuls had three legions assigned him, andthe dictator commanded four. Nor could the war be deferred any longer.The ®qui had made incursions upon the Latin territory; the deputies ofthe Latins begged the senate either to send them assistance, or to allowthem to arm themselves for the purpose of defending their own frontiers.It seemed safer that the Latins should be defended without arming, thanto allow them to take up arms again. Wherefore Vetusius the consul wassent to their assistance; this immediately put a stop to thedevastations. The ®qui retired from the plains, and depending more onthe advantage of the ground than on their arms, secured themselves onthe summits of the mountains. The other consul, having marched againstthe Volsci, in order that he too might not waste time, challenged theenemy to pitch their camp nigh to his, and to risk an engagement byravaging their lands. Both armies stood in order of battle before theirlines in a plain between the two camps. The Volsci had considerably theadvantage in number. Accordingly they rushed on to the fight, in acareless manner, and as if contemptuously. The Roman consul neitheradvanced his forces, and not suffering the enemy's shouts to bereturned, he ordered them to stand still with their spears fixed in theground, and when the enemy came up, to draw their swords and fall uponthem with all their force. The Volsci, wearied with running andshouting, set upon the Romans as if they had been quite benumbedthrough fear; but when they found the vigorous resistance that was made,and saw their swords glittering before their face, they turned theirbacks in great disorder, just as if they had fallen into an ambuscade.Nor had they strength sufficient even for flight, as they had advancedto the battle in full speed. The Romans, on the other hand, as they hadnot stirred from their ground in the beginning of the action, beingfresh and vigorous, easily overtook the enemy, who were weary, tooktheir camp by assault, and after driving them thence, pursued them toVelitr¾, into which the conquered and conquerors entered in a body. Bythe promiscuous slaughter which was here made of all ranks, there wasmore blood spilt than in the battle itself. Quarter was given to a smallnumber of them, who threw down their arms and surrendered."Book 2,Chapter 31,"Whilst these things are going on among the Volsci, the dictatorrouts, puts to flight, and strips of their camp, the Sabines, where byfar the most serious part of the war lay. By a charge of his cavalry hehad thrown into confusion the centre of the enemy's line, where, by thewings extending themselves too far, they had not strengthened their lineby a suitable depth of files.[86] The infantry fell upon them in thisconfusion, by one and the same charge their camp was taken and the warconcluded. There was no other battle in those times more memorable thanthis since the action at the lake Regillus. The dictator is borne intothe city in triumph. Besides the usual honours, a place in the circuswas assigned to him and his descendants, to see the public games; acurule chair was fixed in that place. The lands of Velitr¾ were takenfrom the conquered Volsci: colonists were sent from the city to Velitr¾,and a colony planted there. Soon after there was an engagement with the®qui, but contrary to the wish of the consul, because they had toapproach the enemy by disadvantageous ground. But the soldierscomplaining that the war was on purpose spun out, that the dictatormight resign his office before they returned home to the city, and sohis promises might fall to the ground without effect, as those of theconsul had done before, forced him at all hazards to march his army upthe hill. This imprudent step, by the cowardice of the enemy, turned outsuccessfully; for before the Romans came within reach of a dart, the®qui, quite amazed at their boldness, abandoned their camp, which wassituated in a very strong position, and ran down into the valleys on theopposite side.[87] In it abundance of booty was found, and the victorywas a bloodless one. Matters being thus successfully managed in war inthree different directions, anxiety respecting the event of theirdomestic differences had left neither the senators nor the people. Withsuch powerful influence, and with such art also, had the money-lendersmade their arrangements, so as to disappoint not only the people, buteven the dictator himself. For Valerius, after the return of the consulVetusius, first of all matters brought before the senate that relatingto the victorious people, and proposed the question, what it was theirdetermination should be done with respect to those confined for debt.And when this motion was rejected, ""I am not acceptable,"" says he, ""asan adviser of concord. You will ere long wish, depend on it, that thecommons of Rome had patrons similar to me. For my part, I will neitherfurther disappoint my fellow citizens, nor will I be dictator to nopurpose. Intestine dissensions, foreign wars, caused the republic torequire such a magistrate. Peace has been secured abroad, it is impededat home. I will be a witness to disturbance as a private citizen ratherthan as dictator."" Then quitting the senate-house, he abdicated hisdictatorship. The case appeared to the commons, that he had resigned hisoffice indignant at the treatment shown to them. Accordingly, as if hisengagements to them had been fully discharged, since it had not been hisfault that they were not made good, they attended him when returning tohis home with approbation and applause."Book 2,Chapter 32,"Fear then seized the senators lest, if the army should be dismissed,secret meetings and conspiracies would be renewed; wherefore though thelevy had been held by the dictator, yet supposing that, as they hadsworn obedience to the consuls, the soldiers were bound by their oath,under the pretext of hostilities being renewed by the ®qui, they orderedthe legions to be led out of the city; by which proceeding the seditionwas hastened. And it is said that at first it was in contemplation toput the consuls to death, that they might be discharged from their oath:but that being afterwards informed that no religious obligation could bedissolved by a criminal act, they, by the advice of one Sicinius,retired, without the orders of the consuls, to the sacred mount, beyondthe river Anio, three miles from the city: this account is more generalthan that which Piso has given, that the secession was made to theAventine. There without any leader, their camp being fortified with arampart and trench, remaining quiet, taking nothing but what wasnecessary for sustenance, they kept themselves for several days, neitherbeing attacked, nor attacking others. Great was the panic in the city,and through mutual fear all was suspense. The people left in the citydreaded the violence of the senators; the senators dreaded the peopleremaining in the city, uncertain whether they should prefer them to stayor to depart; but how long would the multitude which had seceded, remainquiet? what were to be the consequences then, if, in the mean time, anyforeign war should break out? they certainly considered no hope left,save in the concord of the citizens; this should be restored to thestate by fair or by unfair means. It was resolved therefore that thereshould be sent as ambassador to the people, Menenius Agrippa, aneloquent man, and one who was a favourite with the people, because hederived his origin from them. He being admitted into the camp, is saidto have related to them merely the following story in that antiquatedand uncouth style; ""At a time when all the parts in the human body didnot, as now, agree together, but the several members had each its ownscheme, its own language, the other parts, indignant that every thingwas procured for the belly by their care, labour, and service; that thebelly, remaining quiet in the centre, did nothing but enjoy thepleasures afforded it. They conspired accordingly, that the hands shouldnot convey food to the mouth, nor the mouth receive it when presented,nor the teeth chew it: whilst they wished under the influence of thisfeeling to subdue the belly by famine, the members themselves and theentire body were reduced to the last degree of emaciation. Thence itbecame apparent that the service of the belly was by no means a slothfulone; that it did not so much receive nourishment as supply it, sendingto all parts of the body this blood by which we live and possessvigour, distributed equally to the veins when perfected by the digestionof the food."" By comparing in this way how similar the intestinesedition of the body was to the resentment of the people against thesenators, he made an impression on the minds of the multitude."Book 2,Chapter 33,"Then a commencement was made to treat of a reconciliation, and amongthe conditions it was allowed, ""that the commons should have their ownmagistrates, with inviolable privileges, who should have the power ofbringing assistance against the consuls, and that it should not belawful for any of the patricians to hold that office."" Thus two tribunesof the commons were created, Caius Licinius and L. Albinus. Thesecreated three colleagues for themselves. It is clear that among thesewas Sicinius, the adviser of the sedition; with respect to two, who theywere is not so clear. There are some who say, that only two tribuneswere elected on the sacred mount, and that there the devoting law waspassed. During the secession of the commons, Sp. Cassius and PostumusCominius entered on the consulship. During their consulate, the treatywith the Latin states was concluded. To ratify this, one of the consulsremained at Rome; the other being sent to the Volscian war, routs andputs to flight the Volscians of Antium, and continuing his pursuit ofthem, now that they were driven into the town of Longula, he takespossession of the town. Next he took Polusca, also belonging to theVolscians; then he attacked Corioli with all his force. There was thenin the camp, among the young noblemen, C. Marcius, a youth distinguishedboth for intelligence and courage, who afterwards attained the cognomenof Coriolanus. When, as the Roman army was besieging Corioli, and waswholly intent on the townspeople, whom they kept shut up, without anyapprehension of war threatening from without, the Volscian legion,setting out from Antium, suddenly attacked them, and, at the same timethe enemy sallied forth from the town, Marcius happened to be on guard.He with a chosen body of men not only repelled the attack of those whohad sallied out, but boldly rushed in through the open gate, and havingcut down all in the part of the city nearest him, and having hastilyseized some fire, threw it in the houses adjoining to the wall. Uponthis the shouts of the townsmen mingling with the wailings of the womenand children, occasioned by the first fright,[88] as is usual, bothincreased the courage of the Romans, and dispirited the Volscians,seeing the city captured to the relief of which they had come. Thus theVolsci of Antium were defeated, the town of Corioli was taken. And somuch did Marcius by his valour eclipse the reputation of the consul,that had not the treaty concluded with the Latins by Sp. Cassius alone,because his colleague was absent, served as a memorial of it, it wouldhave been forgotten that Postumus Cominius had conducted the war withthe Volscians. The same year dies Agrippa Menenius, a man during all hislife equally a favourite with the senators and commons, still moreendeared to the commons after the secession. To this man, the mediatorand umpire in restoring concord among his countrymen, the ambassador ofthe senators to the commons, the person who brought back the commons tothe city, were wanting the expenses of his funeral. The people buriedhim by the contribution of a sextans from each person."Book 2,Chapter 34,"T. Geganius and P. Minutius were next elected consuls. In this year,when every thing was quiet from war abroad, and the dissensions werehealed at home, another much more serious evil fell upon the state;first a scarcity of provisions, in consequence of the lands lyinguntilled during the secession of the commons; then a famine such asbefals those who are besieged. And it would have ended in thedestruction of the slaves at least, and indeed some of the commons also,had not the consuls adopted precautionary measures, by sending personsin every direction to buy up corn, not only into Etruria on the coast tothe right of Ostia, and through the Volscians along the coast on theleft as far as Cumas, but into Sicily also, in quest of it. So far hadthe hatred of their neighbours obliged them to stand in need of aid fromdistant countries. When corn had been bought up at Cum¾, the ships weredetained in lieu of the property of the Tarquinii by the tyrantAristodemus, who was their heir. Among the Volsci and in the Pomptineterritory it could not even be purchased. The corn dealers themselvesincurred danger from the violence of the inhabitants. Corn came fromEtruria by the Tiber: by means of this the people were supported. Amidthis distressing scarcity they would have been harassed by a veryinconvenient war, had not a dreadful pestilence attacked the Volsci whenabout to commence hostilities. The minds of the enemy being alarmed bythis calamity, so that they were influenced by some terror, even afterit had abated, the Romans both augmented the number of their colonistsat Velitr¾, and despatched a new colony to the mountains of Norba, toserve as a barrier in the Pomptine district. Then in the consulship ofM. Minucius, and A. Sempronius, a great quantity of corn was importedfrom Sicily, and it was debated in the senate at what rate it should begiven to the commons. Many were of opinion, that the time was come forputting down the commons, and for recovering those rights which had beenwrested from the senators by secession and violence. In particular,Marcius Coriolanus, an enemy to tribunitian power, says, ""If they desirethe former rate of provisions, let them restore to the senators theirformer rights. Why do I, after being sent under the yoke, after being,as it were, ransomed from robbers, behold plebeian magistrates, andSicinius invested with power? Shall I submit to these indignities longerthan is necessary? Shall I, who would not have endured King Tarquin,tolerate Sicinius. Let him now secede, let him call away the commons.The road lies open to the sacred mount and to other hills. Let themcarry off the corn from our lands, as they did three years since. Letthem have the benefit of that scarcity which in their frenzy they haveoccasioned. I will venture to say, that, brought to their senses bythese sufferings, they will themselves become tillers of the lands,rather than, taking up arms and seceding, they would prevent them frombeing tilled."" It is not so easy to say whether it should have beendone, as I think that it might have been practicable for the senators,on the condition of lowering the price of provisions, to have ridthemselves of both the tribunitian power, and all the restraints imposedon them against their will.[89]"Book 2,Chapter 35,"This proposal both appeared to the senate too harsh, and fromexasperation well nigh drove the people to arms: ""that they were nowassailed with famine, as if enemies, that they were defrauded of foodand sustenance, that the foreign corn, the only support which fortuneunexpectedly furnished to them, was being snatched from their mouth,unless the tribunes were given up in chains to C. Marcius, unless heglut his rage on the backs of the commons of Rome. That in him a newexecutioner had started up, who ordered them to die or be slaves."" Anassault would have been made on him as he left the senate-house, had notthe tribunes very opportunely appointed him a day for trial; by thistheir rage was suppressed, every one saw himself become the judge, thearbiter of the life and death of his foe. At first Marcius heard thethreats of the tribunes with contempt.--""That the right to afford aid,not to inflict punishment, had been granted to that office; that theywere tribunes of the commons and not of the senators."" But the commonshad risen with such violent determination, that the senators wereobliged to extricate themselves from danger by the punishment ofone.[90] They resisted however, in spite of popular odium, and employed,each individual his own powers, and all those of the entire order. Andfirst, the trial was made whether they could upset the affair, byposting their clients (in several places), by deterring individuals fromattending meetings and cabals. Then they all proceeded in a body (youwould suppose that all the senators were on their trial) earnestlyentreating the commons, that if they would not acquit as innocent, theywould at least pardon as guilty, one citizen, one senator. As he did notattend on the day appointed, they persevered in their resentment. Beingcondemned in his absence, he went into exile to the Volsci, threateninghis country, and even then breathing all the resentment of an enemy. TheVolsci received him kindly on his arrival, and treated him still morekindly every day in proportion as his resentful feelings towards hiscountrymen became more striking, and one time frequent complaints,another time threats were heard. He lodged with Attius Tullus. He wasthen the chief man of the Volscian people, and always a determinedenemy of the Romans. Thus, when old animosity stimulated the one, recentresentment the other, they concert schemes for (bringing about) a warwith Rome. They did not at once believe that their people could bepersuaded to take up arms, so often unsuccessfully tried. That by themany frequent wars, and lastly, by the loss of their youth in thepestilence, their spirits were now broken; that they must have recourseto art, in a case where animosity had become blunted from length oftime, that their feelings might become exasperated by some fresh causeof resentment."Book 2,Chapter 36,"It happened that preparations were being made at Rome for arepetition of the [91]great games; the cause of repeating them was this:on the morning of the games, the show not yet being commenced, a masterof a family, after flogging his slave loaded with a neck-yoke, haddriven him through the middle of the circus; after this the games werecommenced, as if that circumstance bore no relation to religion. Notlong after Tit. Atinius, a plebeian, had a dream. Jupiter seemed to himto say; ""that the person who danced previous to the games had displeasedhim; unless these games were renewed on a splendid scale, that the citywould be in danger; that he should go and announce these things to theconsuls."" Though his mind was not altogether free from superstitiousfeelings, his respectful awe of the dignity of the magistrates overcamehis religious fear, lest he might pass into the mouths of people as alaughing-stock. This delay cost him dear; for he lost his son within afew days; and lest the cause of this sudden calamity should be doubtful,that same phantom, presenting itself to him sorrowful in mind, seemed toask him, whether he had received a sufficient requital for his contemptof the deity; that a still heavier one awaited him, unless he wentimmediately and delivered the message to the consuls. The matter was nowstill more pressing. Hesitating, however, and delaying he was at lengthovertaken by a severe stroke of disease, a sudden paralysis. Then indeedthe anger of the gods aroused him. Wearied out therefore by his pastsufferings and by those threatening him, having convened a meeting ofhis friends, after he had detailed to them all he had seen and heard,and Jupiter's having so often presented himself to him in his sleep,the threats and anger of heaven realized[92] in his own calamities, bythe unhesitating assent of all who were present he is conveyed in alitter into the forum to the consuls; from thence being conveyed intothe senate-house, after he had stated those same particulars to thesenators, to the great surprise of all, behold another miracle: he whohad been conveyed into the senate-house deprived of the use of all hislimbs, is recorded to have returned home on his own feet after hedischarged his duty."Book 2,Chapter 37,"The senate decreed that the games should be celebrated on as grand ascale as possible. To these games a great number of Volscians came bythe advice of Attius Tullus. Before the games were commenced, Tullus, ashad been concerted at home with Marcius, comes to the consuls. He tellsthem that there were matters on which he wished to treat with them inprivate concerning the commonwealth. All witnesses being removed, hesays, ""With reluctance I say that of my countrymen which is ratherdisparaging.[93] I do not however come to allege against them any thingas having been committed by them, but to guard against their committingany thing. The minds of our people are far more fickle than I couldwish. We have felt that by many disasters; seeing that we are stillpreserved, not through our own deserts, but through your forbearance.There is now here a great multitude of Volscians. The games are goingon; the city will be intent on the exhibition. I remember what has beencommitted in this city on a similar occasion by the youth of theSabines. My mind shudders lest any thing should be committedinconsiderately and rashly. I considered, that these matters should bementioned before-hand to you, consuls. With regard to myself, it is mydetermination to depart hence home immediately, lest, if present, I maybe affected by the contagion of any word or deed."" Having said this, hedeparted. When the consuls laid before the senate the matter, doubtfulwith respect to proof, though from credible authority, the authoritymore than the thing itself, as usually happens, urged them to adopt evenneedless precautions; and a decree of the senate being passed, that theVolscians should quit the city, criers are sent in different directionsto order them all to depart before night. A great panic struck them atfirst as they ran about to their lodgings to carry away their effects.Afterwards, when setting out, indignation arose in their breasts: ""thatthey, as if polluted with crime and contaminated, were driven away fromthe games, on festival days, from the converse in a manner of men andgods."""Book 2,Chapter 38,"As they went along in an almost continuous body, Tullus havingpreceded them to the fountain of Ferentina, accosting the chiefs amongthem according as each arrived, by asking questions and expressingindignation, he led both themselves, who greedily listened to languagecongenial[94] to their angry feelings, and through them the rest of themultitude, into a plain adjoining to the road. There having commenced anaddress after the manner of a public harangue, he says, ""Though you wereto forget the former ill treatment of the Roman people and thecalamities of the nation of the Volsci, and all other such matters, withwhat feelings do you bear this outrage offered you to-day, whereon theyhave commenced their games by insulting us? Have you not felt that atriumph has been had over you this day? that you, when departing, were aspectacle to all, citizens, foreigners, so many neighbouring states?that your wives, your children were exhibited before the eyes of men?What do you suppose to have been the sentiments of those who heard thevoice of the crier? what of those who saw you departing? what of thosewho met this ignominious cavalcade? what, except that we are identifiedwith some enormous guilt by which we should profane the games, andrender an expiation necessary; that for this reason we are driven awayfrom the residences of these pious people, from their converse andmeeting? what, does it not strike you that we still live because wehastened our departure? if this is a departure and not a flight. And doyou not consider this to be the city of enemies, where if you haddelayed a single day, you must have all died? War has been declaredagainst you; to the heavy injury of those who declared it, if you aremen."" Thus, being both already charged with resentment, and incited (bythis harangue) they went severally to their homes, and by instigatingeach his own state, they succeeded in making the entire Volscian nationrevolt."Book 2,Chapter 39,"The generals selected for that war by the unanimous choice of allthe states were Attius Tullus and Caius Marcius; in the latter of whomtheir chief hope was reposed. And this hope he by no means disappointed:so that it clearly appeared that the Roman commonwealth was morepowerful by reason of its generals than its army. Having marched toCirceii, he expelled from thence the Roman colonists, and delivered thatcity in a state of freedom to the Volscians. From thence passing acrossthe country through by-roads into the Latin way, he deprived the Romansof their recently acquired towns, Satricum, Longula, Polusca, Corioli.He next retook Lavinium: he then took in succession Corbio, Vitellia,Trebia, Lavici, and Pedum: Lastly he marches from Pedum to the city,[95]and having pitched his camp at the Cluilian trenches five miles from thecity, he from thence ravages the Roman territory, guards being sentamong the devastators to preserve the lands of the patricians intact;whether as being incensed chiefly against the plebeians, or in orderthat dissension might arise between the senators and the people. Andthis certainly would have arisen, so powerfully did the tribunes, byinveighing against the leading men of the state, incite the plebeians,already sufficiently violent of themselves; but their apprehensions ofthe foe, the strongest bond of concord, united their minds, distrustfuland rancorous though they were. The only matter not agreed on was this,that the senate and consuls rested their hopes on nothing else than onarms; the plebeians preferred any thing to war. Sp. Nautius and Sex.Furius were now consuls. Whilst they were reviewing the legions, postingguards along the walls and other places where they had determined thatthere should be posts and watches, a vast multitude of personsdemanding peace terrified them first by their seditious clamour; thencompelled them to convene the senate, to consider the question ofsending ambassadors to C. Marcius. The senate entertained the question,when it became evident that the spirits of the plebeians were givingway, and ambassadors being sent to Marcius concerning peace, broughtback a harsh answer: ""If their lands were restored to the Volscians,that they might then consider the question of peace; if they weredisposed to enjoy the plunder of war at their ease, that he, mindfulboth of the injurious treatment of his countrymen, as well as of thekindness of strangers, would do his utmost to make it appear that hisspirit was irritated by exile, not crushed."" When the same persons aresent back a second time, they are not admitted into the camp. It isrecorded that the priests also, arrayed in their insignia, went assuppliants to the enemy's camp; and that they did not influence his mindmore than the ambassadors."Book 2,Chapter 40,"Then the matrons assemble in a body around Veturia, the mother ofCoriolanus, and his wife, Volumnia: whether that was the result ofpublic counsel, or of the women's fear, I cannot ascertain. Theycertainly carried their point that Veturia, a lady advanced in years,and Volumnia, leading her two sons by Marcius, should go into the campof the enemy, and that women should defend by entreaties and tears acity which men were unable to defend by arms. When they reached thecamp, and it was announced to Coriolanus, that a great body of womenwere approaching, he, who had been moved neither by the majesty of thestate in its ambassadors, nor by the sanctity of religion so strikinglyaddressed to his eyes and understanding in its priests, was much moreobdurate against the women's tears. Then one of his acquaintances, whorecognised Veturia, distinguished from all the others by her sadness,standing between her daughter-in-law and grand-children, says, ""Unlessmy eyes deceive me, your mother, children, and wife, are approaching.""When Coriolanus, almost like one bewildered, rushing in consternationfrom his seat, offered to embrace his mother as she met him, the lady,turning from entreaties to angry rebuke, says, ""Before I receive yourembrace, let me know whether I have come to an enemy or to a son;whether I am in your camp a captive or a mother? Has length of life anda hapless old age reserved me for this--to behold you an exile, then anenemy? Could you lay waste this land, which gave you birth and nurturedyou? Though you had come with an incensed and vengeful mind, did notyour resentment subside when you entered its frontiers? When Rome camewithin view, did it not occur to you, within these walls my house andguardian gods are, my mother, wife, and children? So then, had I notbeen a mother, Rome would not be besieged: had I not a son, I might havedied free in a free country. But I can now suffer nothing that is notmore discreditable to you than distressing to me; nor however wretched Imay be, shall I be so long. Look to these, whom, if you persist, eitheran untimely death or lengthened slavery awaits."" Then his wife andchildren embraced him: and the lamentation proceeding from the entirecrowd of women, and their bemoaning themselves and their country, atlength overcame the man; then, after embracing his family, he sends themaway; he moved his camp farther back from the city. Then, after he haddrawn off his troops from the Roman territory, they say that he lost hislife, overwhelmed by the odium of the proceeding: different writers sayby different modes of death: I find in Fabius, far the most ancientwriter, that he lived even to old age; he states positively, thatadvanced in years he made use of this phrase, ""That exile bore muchheavier on the old man."" The men of Rome were not remiss in awardingtheir praises to the women, so truly did they live without detractingfrom the merit of others; a temple was built also and dedicated tofemale Fortune, to serve as a monument. The Volscians afterwardsreturned in conjunction with the ®qui into the Roman territory: but the®qui would no longer have Attius Tullus as their leader; hence fromdispute, whether the Volscians or the ®qui should give a general to theallied army, a sedition, and afterwards a furious battle arose. Therethe good fortune of the Roman people destroyed the two armies of theenemy, by a contest no less bloody than obstinate. T. Sicinius and C.Aquillius were made consuls. The Volsci fell as a province to Sicinius;the Hernici (for they too were in arms) to Aquillius. That year theHernici were defeated; they came off with respect to the Volscians onequal terms."Book 2,Chapter 41,"Sp. Cassius and Proculus Virginius were next made consuls; a treatywas struck with the Hernici; two-thirds of their land were taken fromthem: of this the consul Cassius was about to distribute one half amongthe Latins, the other half among the commons. To this donation he wasadding a considerable portion of land, which, though public property, healleged was possessed by private individuals. This proceeding alarmedseveral of the senators, the actual possessors, at the danger of theirproperty; the senators felt, moreover, a solicitude on public grounds,that the consul by his donation was establishing an influence dangerousto liberty. Then, for the first time, the Agrarian law was proposed,which even down to our own recollection was never agitated without thegreatest commotions in the state. The other consul resisted thedonation, the senators seconding him, nor were all the commons opposedto him; they had at first begun to despise a gift which was extendedfrom citizens to allies: in the next place they frequently heard theconsul Virginius in the assemblies as it were prophesying--""that thegift of his colleague was pestilential--that those lands were sure tobring slavery to those who should receive them; that the way was pavingto a throne."" For why was it that the allies were included, and theLatin nation? What was the object of a third of the land that had beentaken being given back to the Hernici so lately our enemies, except thatinstead of Coriolanus being their leader they may have Cassius? Thedissuader and opposer of the agrarian law now began to be popular. Bothconsuls then vied with each other in humouring the commons. Virginiussaid that he would suffer the lands to be assigned, provided they wereassigned to no one but to a Roman citizen. Cassius, because in theagrarian donation he sought popularity among the allies, and wastherefore lowered in the estimation of his countrymen, in order that byanother donation he might conciliate their affections, ordered that themoney received for the Sicilian corn should be refunded to the people.That indeed the people rejected as nothing else than a present bribe forregal authority: so strongly were his gifts spurned in the minds of men,as if they possessed every thing in abundance, in consequence of theirinveterate suspicions of his aiming at sovereign power. As soon as hewent out of office, it is certain that he was condemned and put todeath. There are some who represent his father as the person whoinflicted the punishment: that he, having tried him at home, scourgedhim and put him to death, and consecrated his son's private property toCeres; that out of this a statue was set up and inscribed, ""given fromthe Cassian family."" In some authors I find it stated, and that is moreprobable, that a day of trial was assigned him for high treason, by thequestors, K¾so Fabius and Lucius Valerius; and that he was condemned bythe decision of the people; that his house was demolished by a publicdecree: this is the area before the temple of Tellus. But whether thattrial was private or public, he was condemned in the consulship of Ser.Cornelius and Q. Fabius."Book 2,Chapter 42,"The resentment of the people against Cassius was not of longduration. The allurements of the agrarian law, now that its proposer wasgone, were of themselves gaining ground in their minds; and this feelingwas further heightened by the parsimonious conduct of the senators, who,the Volsci and ®qui having been defeated that year, defrauded thesoldiers of the booty; whatever was taken from the enemy, the consulFabius sold, and lodged the proceeds in the treasury. The Fabian namewas odious to the commons on account of the last consul: the senatehowever succeeded in having K¾so Fabius elected consul with L. ®milius.The commons, still further incensed at this, stirred up foreign war byexciting disturbance at home; civil dissensions were then interrupted bywar. The senators and commons uniting, under the conduct of ®milius,conquered in battle the Volsci and ®qui who renewed hostilities. Theretreat, however, destroyed more of the enemy than the battle; soperseveringly did the horse pursue them when routed. During the sameyear, on the ides of July, the temple of Castor was dedicated: it hadbeen vowed during the Latin war in the dictatorship of Posthumius: hisson, who was elected duumvir for that special purpose, dedicated it. Inthat year also the minds of the people were excited by the charms of theagrarian law. The tribunes of the people were for enhancing the popularpower (vested in them) by promoting the popular law. The senators,considering that there was enough and more than enough of frenzy in themultitude without any additional incitement, viewed with horrorlargesses and all inducements to temerity: the senators found in theconsuls most energetic abettors in making resistance. That portion ofthe commonwealth therefore prevailed; and not for the present only, butfor the forthcoming year they succeeded in bringing in M. Fabius, K¾so'sbrother, as consul, and one still more detested by the commons for hispersecution of Sp. Cassius, L. Valerius. In that year also there was acontest with the tribunes. The law proved to be a vain project, and theabettors of the law mere boasters, by their holding out a gift that wasnot realized. The Fabian name was from thence held in high repute, afterthree successive consulates, and all as it were uniformly exercised incontending with the tribunes; accordingly, the honour remained for aconsiderable time in that family, as being right well placed. AVeientian war was then commenced; the Volscians, too, renewedhostilities; but for foreign wars their strength was almost more thansufficient, and they abused it by contending among themselves. To thedistracted state of the public mind were added prodigies from heaven,exhibiting almost daily threats in the city and in the country, and thesoothsayers, consulted by the state and by private individuals, onewhile by means of entrails, another by birds, declared that there was noother cause for the divine anger, but that the ceremonies of religionwere not duly attended to. These terrors, however, terminated in this,that Oppia, a vestal virgin, being found guilty of a breach of chastity,was made to suffer punishment."Book 2,Chapter 43,"Quintus Fabius and C. Julius were then made consuls. During thisyear the dissension at home was not abated, and the war abroad was moredesperate. Arms were taken up by the ®quans; the Veientes also enteredthe territory of the Romans committing devastations; the solicitudeabout which wars increasing, K¾so Fabius and Sp. Fusius are createdconsuls. The ®qui were laying siege to Ortona, a Latin city. TheVeientes, now satiated with plunder, threatened that they would besiegeRome itself. Which terrors, when they ought to assuage, increased stillfurther the bad feelings of the commons: and the custom of declining themilitary service was now returning, not of their own accord; but Sp.Licinius, a tribune of the people, thinking that the time was come forforcing the agrarian law on the patricians by extreme necessity, hadtaken on him the task of obstructing the military preparations. But allthe odium of the tribunitian power was turned on the author; nor did theconsuls rise up against him more zealously than his own colleagues; andby their assistance the consuls hold the levy. An army is raised for thetwo wars at the same time; one is given to Fabius to be led against the®qui, the other to Furius against the Veientians. And with respect tothe Veientians, nothing was done worthy of mention. Fabius had much moretrouble with his countrymen than with the enemy: that one man himself,as consul, sustained the commonwealth, which the army was betraying, faras in them lay, through their hatred of the consul. For when the consul,in addition to his other military talents, which he exhibited amply inhis preparations for and conduct of war, had so drawn up his line thathe routed the enemy's army solely by a charge of his cavalry, theinfantry refused to pursue them when routed: and though the exhortationof their general, whom they hated, could not move them, neither couldeven their own infamy, and the present public disgrace and subsequentdanger, if the enemy should recover courage, oblige them to quickentheir pace, or even to stand in order of battle, if nothing else.Without orders they face about, and with a sorrowful air (you wouldsuppose them beaten) they return to the camp, execrating at one timetheir general, at another time the services rendered by the cavalry. Norwere any remedies sought by the general for this so pestilent anexample; so true is it that the most distinguished talents are morelikely to be deficient in the tact of managing their countrymen than inthat of conquering an enemy. The consul returned to Rome, not having somuch increased his military glory as irritated and exasperated thehatred of his soldiers towards him. The patricians, however, succeededin having the consulship remain in the Fabian family. They elect M.Fabius consul: Cn. Manlius is assigned as a colleague to Fabius."Book 2,Chapter 44,"This year also had a tribune as a proposer of the agrarian law. Itwas Titus Pontificius: he pursuing the same course, as if it hadsucceeded with Sp. Licinius, obstructed the levy for a little time. Thepatricians being once more perplexed, Appius Claudius asserts ""that thetribunitian power was put down last year: for the present by the veryact, for the future by the precedent established, and since it was foundthat it could be rendered ineffective by its own strength; for thatthere never would be wanting a tribune who would both be willing toobtain a victory for himself over his colleague, and the favour of thebetter party by advancing the public weal. That both a plurality oftribunes, if there were need of such plurality, would be ready to assistthe consuls; and that even one would be sufficient against all. Only letthe consuls and leading members of the senate take care to gain over, ifnot all, at least some of the tribunes, to the commonwealth and thesenate."" The senators, convinced by the counsels of Appius, bothcollectively addressed the tribunes with kindness and civility, and themen of consular rank, according as each possessed personal influenceover them individually, partly by conciliation, partly by authority,prevailed so far as to make them consent that the powers of thetribunitian office should be beneficial to the state; and by the aid offour tribunes against one obstructor of the public good, the consulscomplete the levy. They then set out to the Veientian war, to whichauxiliaries had flocked from all parts of Etruria, collected not so muchfor the sake of the Veientians, as because they had formed a hope thatthe Roman state might be destroyed by internal discord. And in thecouncils of all the states of Etruria the leading men openly stated,""that the Roman power was eternal, unless they were distracted bydisturbances among themselves. That this was the only poison, this thebane discovered for powerful states, to render great empires mortal.That this evil, a long time retarded, partly by the wise measures of thepatricians, partly by the forbearance of the commons, had now proceededto extremities. That two states were now formed out of one: that eachparty had its own magistrates, its own laws. That though at first theywere accustomed to be turbulent during the levies, still that these sameindividuals had ever been obedient to their commanders during war; thatmilitary discipline being still retained, no matter what might be thestate of the city, it had been possible to withstand the evil; that nowthe custom of not obeying their superior followed the Roman soldier evento the camp. That in the last war in the very field, in the very heat ofbattle, by consent of the army the victory was voluntarily surrenderedto the vanquished ®qui: that the standards were deserted, the generalabandoned on the field, and that the army had returned to the campwithout orders. That without doubt, if perseverance were used, Romemight be conquered by her own soldiery. That nothing else was necessarythan to declare and make a show of war: that the fates and the godswould of themselves manage the rest."" These hopes had armed theEtrurians, who in many vicissitudes had been vanquished and victors."Book 2,Chapter 45,"The Roman consuls also dreaded nothing else, than their ownstrength, and their own arms. The recollection of the destructiveprecedent set in the last war, deterred them from bringing matters tosuch a pass as that they should have to fear two armies at the sametime. Accordingly they kept within their camp, avoiding this doubledanger: ""that delay and time itself would soften down resentment, andbring a right way of thinking to their minds."" The Veientian enemy andthe Etrurians proceeded with so much the greater precipitation; theyprovoked them to battle, first riding up to the camp and challengingthem; at length, when they produced no effect by reviling as well theconsuls themselves as the army, they stated, ""that the pretence ofinternal dissension was assumed as a cloak for this cowardice; and thatthe consuls distrusted as much the courage as the obedience of theirsoldiers. That silence and inaction among men in arms were a novel formof sedition."" Besides this they threw out reproaches, both true as wellas false, on the upstart quality of their race and origin. Whilst theyvociferated these reproaches beneath the very rampart and gates, theconsuls bore them without impatience: but at one time indignation, atanother time shame, distracted the breasts of the ignorant multitude,and diverted their attention from intestine evils; they were unwillingthat the enemy should come off unpunished; they were unwilling thatsuccess should accrue to the patricians or the consuls; foreign anddomestic hatred struggled for mastery in their breasts; at length theformer prevail, so haughtily and insolently did the enemy revile them;they crowd in a body to the general's tent; they demand battle, theyrequire that the signal be given. The consuls confer together as if todeliberate; they continue the conference for a long time; they weredesirous of fighting, but that desire must be checked and concealed,that by opposition and delay they might increase the ardour of thesoldiery once roused. An answer is returned, ""that the matter inquestion was premature, that it was not yet time for fighting: that theyshould keep within their camp."" They then issue a proclamation, ""thatthey should abstain from fighting; that if any one fought withoutorders, they should punish him as an enemy."" When they were thusdismissed, their eagerness for fighting increases in proportion as theythink that the consuls were less disposed for it; the enemies moreovercome up much more insolently, as soon as it was known that the consulshad determined not to fight. For they supposed ""that they might insultthem with impunity; that their arms were not intrusted to the soldiery.That the matter would explode in a violent mutiny; that a terminationhad come to the Roman empire."" Relying on these hopes, they run up tothe gates, heap reproaches on them, with difficulty refrain fromassaulting the camp. Now indeed the Romans could no longer endure theseinsults; they crowd from every quarter of the camp to the consuls: theyno longer, as formerly, make their demand with reserve, through themediation of the centurions of the first rank; but all proceedindiscriminately with loud clamours. The affair was now ripe; still theyput it off. Fabius then, his colleague giving way in consequence of hisdread of mutiny being now augmented by the uproar, after he hadcommanded silence by sound of trumpet, says, ""that these men are able toconquer, Cneius Manlius, I know; that they are willing they themselveshave prevented me from knowing. It is therefore resolved and determinednot to give the signal, unless they swear that they will returnvictorious from this battle. The soldier has once deceived the Romanconsul in the field, the gods he never will deceive."" There was acenturion, Marcus Flavoleius, one of the foremost in demanding battle;he says, ""M. Fabius, I will return victorious from the field."" If hedeceived, he invokes the anger of father Jove, Mars Gradivus, and of theother gods. After him the entire army severally take the same oath. Thesignal is given to them when sworn; they take up arms, go into battle,full of rage and of hope. They bid the Etrurians now to cast theirreproaches; they severally require that the enemy, once so ready withthe tongue, should now stand before them armed as they were. On that daythe bravery of all, both commons and patricians, was extraordinary: theFabian name, the Fabian race shone forth most conspicuous: they aredetermined to recover in that battle the affections of the commons,which during many civil contests had been alienated from them. The lineof battle is formed; nor do the Veientian foe and the Etrurian legionsdecline the contest."Book 2,Chapter 46,"An almost certain hope was entertained that they would no more fightwith them than they had done with the ®qui; that even some more seriousattempt was not to be despaired of, considering the irritated state oftheir feelings, and the very critical occasion. The affair turned outaltogether differently; for never before in any other war did the Romansoldiers enter the field with more determined minds (so much had theenemy exasperated them by taunts on the one hand, and the consuls bydelay on the other). The Etrurians had scarcely time to form theirranks, when the javelins having been thrown away at random, in the firsthurry, rather than discharged with aim, the battle had now come to closefighting, even to swords, where the fury of war is most desperate. Amongthe foremost the Fabian family was distinguished for the sight itafforded and the example it presented to their fellow citizens; one ofthese, Q. Fabius, (he had been consul two years before,) as he wasadvancing at the head of his men against a dense body of Veientians, andwhilst engaged amid numerous parties of the enemy, and therefore notprepared for it, was transfixed with a sword through the breast by aTuscan who presumed on his bodily strength and skill in arms: on theweapon being extracted, Fabius fell forward on the wound. Both armiesfelt the fall of this one man, and the Roman began in consequence togive way, when the consul Marcus Fabius leaped over the body as it lay,and holding up his buckler, said, ""Is this what you swore, soldiers,that you would return to the camp in flight? are you thus more afraid ofyour most dastardly enemies, than of Jupiter and Mars, by whom you havesworn? But I who have not sworn will either return victorious, or willfall fighting here beside thee, Q. Fabius."" Then K¾so Fabius, the consulof the preceding year, says to the consul, ""Brother, is it by thesewords you think you will prevail on them to fight? the gods by whom theyhave sworn will prevail on them. Let us also, as men of noble birth, asis worthy of the Fabian name, enkindle the courage of the soldiers byfighting rather than by exhorting."" Thus the two Fabii rush forward tothe front with presented spears, and brought on with them the wholeline."Book 2,Chapter 47,"The battle being restored on one side, Cn. Manlius, the consul, withno less ardour, encouraged the fight on the other wing. Where an almostsimilar result took place; for as the soldiers undauntedly followed Q.Fabius on the one wing, so did they follow Manlius on this, as he wasdriving the enemy now nearly routed, and when he, having received asevere wound, retired from the battle, they fell back, supposing that hewas slain, and would have given way, had not the other consul, gallopingat full speed to that quarter with some troops of horse, supported theirdrooping energies, crying out that his colleague was still alive, thathe himself was now come victorious, having routed the other wing.Manlius also shows himself to restore the battle. The well-known voicesof the two consuls rekindle the courage of the soldiers; at the sametime too the enemy's line was now weakened, whilst, relying on theirsuperior numbers, they draw off their reserve and send them to storm thecamp. This being assaulted without much resistance, whilst they losetime in attending to plunder rather than to fighting, the Romantriarii,[96] who had not been able to sustain the first shock, havingsent an account to the consuls of the present position of affairs,return in a compact body to the Pr¾torium, and of themselves renew thebattle. The consul Manlius also having returned to the camp, and postedsoldiers at all the gates, had blocked up every passage against theenemy. This desperate situation aroused the fury rather than the braveryof the Etrurians; for when rushing on wherever hope held out theprospect of escape, they had frequently advanced with fruitless efforts;one body of young men makes an attack on the consul himself, conspicuousfrom his arms. The first weapons were intercepted by those who stoodaround him; afterwards their force could not be sustained. The consulfalls, having received a mortal wound, and all around him are dispersed.The courage of the Etrurians rises. Terror drives the Romans in dismaythrough the entire camp; and matters would have come to extremities, hadnot the lieutenant-generals, hastily seizing the body of the consul,opened a passage for the enemy at one gate. Through this they rush out;and going away in the utmost disorder, they fall in with the otherconsul who had been victorious; there again they are slain and routed inevery direction. A glorious victory was obtained, saddened however bytwo so illustrious deaths. The consul, therefore, on the senate votinghim a triumph, replied, that ""if the army could triumph without theirgeneral, he would readily accede to it in consideration of theirdistinguished behaviour in that war: that for his own part, his familybeing plunged in grief in consequence of the death of his brother Q.Fabius, and the commonwealth being in some degree bereaved by the lossof one of her consuls, he would not accept the laurel blasted by publicand private grief."" The triumph thus resigned was more distinguishedthan any triumph actually enjoyed; so true it is, that glory refused indue season sometimes returns with accumulated lustre. He next celebratesthe two funerals of his colleague and brother, one after the other, hehimself acting as panegyrist in the case of both, when by ascribing tothem his own deserts, he himself obtained the greatest share of them.And not unmindful of that which he had conceived at the commencement ofhis consulate, namely, the regaining the affection of the people, hedistributes the wounded soldiers among the patricians to be cured. Mostof them were given to the Fabii: nor were they treated with greaterattention in any other place. From this time the Fabii began to bepopular, and that not by any practices except such as were beneficial tothe state."Book 2,Chapter 48,"Accordingly K¾so Fabius, having been elected consul with T.Virginius not more with the zealous wishes of the senators than of thecommons, attended neither to wars, nor levies, nor any other object,until the hope of concord being now in some measure commenced, thefeelings of the commons might be consolidated with those of the senatorsas soon as possible. Wherefore at the commencement of the year heproposed: ""that before any tribune should stand forth as an abettor ofthe agrarian law, the patricians themselves should be beforehand withthem in performing their duty; that they should distribute among thecommons the land taken from the enemy in as equal a proportion aspossible; that it was but just that those should obtain it, by whoseblood and sweat it was obtained."" The patricians rejected the proposalwith scorn; some even complained that the once brilliant talents of K¾sowere now becoming wanton, and were waning through excess of glory. Therewere afterwards no factions in the city. The Latins were harassed by theincursions of the ®qui. K¾so being sent thither with an army, passesinto the very territory of the ®qui to depopulate it. The ®qui retiredinto the towns, and kept themselves within the walls: on that account nobattle worth mentioning was fought. But a blow was received from theVeientian foe through the temerity of the other consul; and the armywould have been all cut off, had not K¾so Fabius come to theirassistance in time. From that time there was neither peace nor war withthe Veientians; their proceedings had now come very near to the form ofthat of brigands. They retired from the Roman troops into the city; whenthey perceived that the troops were drawn off, they made incursions intothe country, alternately evading war by quiet, quiet by war. Thus thematter could neither be dropped altogether, nor brought to a conclusion;and other wars were impending either at the moment, as from the ®qui andVolsci, who remained inactive no longer than until the recent smart oftheir late disaster should pass away; or it was evident that theSabines, ever hostile, and all Etruria would put themselves in motion:but the Veientians, a constant rather than a formidable enemy, kepttheir minds in constant uneasiness by their insults more frequently thanby any danger apprehended from them; a matter which could at no time beneglected, and which suffered them not to direct their attention to anyother object. Then the Fabian family addressed the senate; the consulspeaks in the name of the family: ""Conscript fathers, the Veientian warrequires, as you know, a constant rather than a strong force. Do youattend to other wars: assign the Fabii as enemies to the Veientians. Wepledge ourselves that the majesty of the Roman name shall be safe inthat quarter. That war, as the property of our family, it is ourdetermination to conduct at our own private expense. Let the republic bespared the expense of soldiers and money there."" The warmest thanks werereturned to them. The consul, leaving the senate-house, accompanied bythe Fabii in a body, who had been standing in the porch of thesenate-house, returned home. Being ordered to attend on the followingday in arms at the consul's gate, they retire to their homes."Book 2,Chapter 49,"The rumour spreads through the entire city; they extol the Fabii tothe skies by their encomiums. ""That a single family had taken on themthe burden of the state: that the Veientian war had now become a privateconcern, a private quarrel. If there were two families of the samestrength in the city, let them demand, the one the Volsci for itself,the other the ®qui; that all the neighbouring states might be subdued,the Roman people all the time enjoying profound peace."" The dayfollowing, the Fabii take up arms; they assemble where they had beenordered. The consul coming forth in his paludamentum,[97] beholds hisentire family in the porch drawn up in order of march; being receivedinto the centre, he orders the standards to be carried forward. Neverdid an army march through the city, either smaller in number, or moredistinguished in fame and in the admiration of all men. Three hundredand six soldiers, all patricians, all of the one stock, not one of whomthe senate would reject as a leader in its palmiest days, proceeded ontheir march, menacing destruction to the Veientian state by the prowessof a single family. A crowd followed, partly belonging to their kinsmenand friends, who contemplated in mind no moderation either as to theirhopes or anxiety, but every thing on the highest scale; partlyconsisting of individuals not connected with their family, aroused bysolicitude for the public weal, all enraptured with esteem andadmiration. They bid them ""proceed in the brave resolve, proceed withhappy omens, bring back results proportioned to their undertaking:thence to expect consulships and triumphs, all rewards, all honours fromthem."" As they passed the Capitol and the citadel, and the other sacrededifices, they offer up prayers to all the gods that presentedthemselves to their sight, or to their mind: that ""they would sendforward that band with prosperity and success, and soon send them backsafe into their country to their parents."" In vain were these prayerssent up. Having set out on their luckless road by the right-hand posternof the Carmental gate, they arrive at the river Cremera: this appeareda favourable situation for fortifying a post. L. ®milius and C.Servilius were then created consuls. And as long as there was nothingelse to occupy them but mutual devastations, the Fabii were not onlysufficiently able to protect their garrison, but through the entiretract, as far as the Etrurian joins the Roman territory, they protectedall their own districts and ravaged those of the enemy, spreading theirforces along both frontiers. There was afterwards an intermission,though not of long duration, to these depredations: whilst both theVeientians, having sent for an army from Etruria, assault the post atthe Cremera, and the Roman troops, led thither by L. ®milius the consul,come to a close engagement in the field with the Etrurians; although theVeientians had scarcely time to draw up their line: for during the firstalarm, whilst the ranks are posting themselves behind their respectivebanners and they are stationing their reserves, a brigade of Romancavalry charging them suddenly in flank, took away all opportunity notonly of commencing the fight, but even of standing their ground. Thusbeing driven back to the Red Rocks, (there they pitched their camp,)they suppliantly sue for peace; for the obtaining of which they weresorry, from the natural inconsistency of their minds, before the Romangarrison was drawn off from the Cremera."Book 2,Chapter 50,"Again the Veientian state had to contend with the Fabii without anyadditional military armament [on either side]; and there were not merelyincursions into each other's territories, or sudden attacks on thosemaking the incursions, but they fought repeatedly in the open field, andin pitched battles: and one family of the Roman people oftentimes gainedthe victory over an entire Etrurian state, one of the most powerful atthat time. This at first appeared mortifying and humiliating to theVeientians: then (they formed) a design, suggested by the circumstance,of surprising their daring enemy by an ambuscade; they were even gladthat the confidence of the Fabii was increasing by their great success.Wherefore cattle were frequently driven in the way of the plunderingparties, as if they had come there by mere accident, and tracts of landwere abandoned by the flight of the peasants; and troops of armed mensent to prevent the devastations retreated more frequently frompretended than from real fear. And now the Fabii had such a contempt forthe enemy, as to believe that their invincible arms could not bewithstood either in any place or on any occasion: this presumptioncarried them so far, that at the sight of some cattle at a distance fromCremera, with an extensive plain lying between, they ran down to it(although few troops of the enemy were observed); and when incautiousand in disorderly haste they had passed the ambuscade placed on eitherside of the very road; and when dispersed in different directions theybegan to carry off the cattle straying about, as is usual when they arefrightened, the Veientians rise up suddenly from their ambuscade, andthe enemy were in front and on every side. At first the shout that wasraised terrified them; then weapons assailed them from every side; and,the Etrurians closing, they also were compelled, hemmed in as they nowwere by a compact body of soldiers, to contract their own circle withina narrower compass; which circumstance rendered striking both their ownpaucity of numbers, and the superior numbers of the enemy, the ranksbeing crowded in a narrow space. Then the plan of fighting, which theyhad directed equally against every part, being now relinquished, theyall incline their forces towards one point; in that direction strainingevery effort both with their bodies and arms, they forced a passage byforming a wedge. The way led to a hill of moderate acclivity; here theyfirst halted: presently, as soon as the higher ground afforded them timeto gain breath, and to recover from so great a panic, they repulsed themas they advanced up; and the small band by the advantage of the groundwas gaining the victory, had not a party of the Veientians, sent roundthe ridge of the hill, made their way to the summit; thus again theenemy obtained the higher ground; all the Fabii were killed to a man,and the fort was taken: it is agreed on all hands that the three hundredand six were cut off; that one[98] only, who nearly attained the age ofpuberty, was left as a stock for the Fabian race; and that he wasdestined to prove the greatest support in the dangerous emergencies ofthe Roman people both at home and in war."Book 2,Chapter 51,"At the time when this disaster was received, C. Horatius and T.Menenius were consuls. Menenius was immediately sent against theEtrurians, elated with victory. Then too an unsuccessful battle wasfought, and the enemy took possession of the Janiculum: and the citywould have been besieged, scarcity of provisions bearing hard upon themin addition to the war, (for the Etrurians had passed the Tiber,) hadnot the consul Horatius been recalled from the Volsci; and so closelydid that war approach the very walls, that the first battle was foughtnear the temple of Hope with doubtful success, and a second time at theColline gate. There, although the Romans had the advantage in a slightdegree only, yet that contest rendered the soldiers better for futurebattles by restoring to them their former courage. Aulus Virginius andSp. Servilius are created consuls. After the defeat sustained in thelast battle, the Veientians declined an engagement. Ravages werecommitted, and they made incursions in every direction on the Romanterritory from the Janiculum as if from a fortress; no where were thecattle or the husbandmen safe. They were afterwards entrapped by thesame stratagem as that by which they had entrapped the Fabii: havingpursued some cattle that had been driven on designedly for the purposeof decoying them, they fell into an ambuscade; in proportion as theywere more numerous, the slaughter was greater. The violent resentmentresulting from this disaster was the cause and commencement of one stillgreater: for having crossed the Tiber by night, they attempted toassault the camp of the consul Servilius; being repulsed from thencewith great slaughter, they with difficulty made good their retreat intothe Janiculum. The consul himself also crosses the Tiber, fortifies hiscamp at the foot of the Janiculum: at break of day on the followingmorning, both from being somewhat elated by the success of the battle ofthe day before, more however because the scarcity of corn forced himinto measures which, though dangerous, (he adopted) because they weremore expeditious, he rashly marched his army up the steep of theJaniculum to the camp of the enemy, and being repulsed from thence withmore disgrace than he had repulsed them on the preceding day, he wassaved, both himself and his army, by the intervention of his colleague.The Etrurians (hemmed in) between the two armies, when they presentedtheir rear to the one and the other by turns, were entirely cut off.Thus the Veientian war was crushed by a fortunate act of temerity."Book 2,Chapter 52,"Together with the peace, provisions returned to the city in greaterabundance, both by reason of corn having been brought in from Campania,and, as soon as the fear felt by each of future famine left them, thatcorn being brought forward which had been hoarded up. Then their mindsonce more became licentious from their present abundance and ease, andtheir former subjects of complaint, now that there were none abroad,they sought for at home; the tribunes began to excite the commons bytheir poison, the agrarian law: they roused them against the senatorswho opposed it, and not only against them as a body, but also againstparticular individuals. Q. Considius and T. Genucius, the proposers ofthe agrarian law, appoint a day of trial for T. Menenius: the loss ofthe fort of Cremera, whilst the consul had his standing camp at no greatdistance from thence, was the charge against him. They crushed him,though both the senators had exerted themselves in his behalf with noless earnestness than in behalf of Coriolanus, and the popularity of hisfather Agrippa was not yet forgotten. The tribunes, however, went nofurther than a fine: though they had arraigned him for a capitaloffence, they imposed on him, when found guilty, a fine of two thousand_asses_. This proved fatal. They say that he could not submit to thedisgrace, and to the anguish of mind (occasioned by it): that, inconsequence, he was taken off by disease. Another senator, Sp.Servilius, being soon after arraigned, as soon as he went out of office,a day of trial having been appointed for him by the tribunes, L.C¾dicius and T. Statius, at the very commencement of the year, in theconsulship of C. Nautius and P. Valerius, did not, like Menenius, meetthe attacks of the tribunes with supplications from himself and thepatricians, but with firm reliance on his own integrity, and hispersonal influence. The battle with the Etrurians at the Janiculum wasthe charge against him also: but being a man of an intrepid spirit, ashe had formerly acted in the case of public peril, so now in that whichwas personal to himself, he dispelled the danger by boldly facing it, byconfuting not only the tribunes but the commons also, by a bold speech,and upbraiding them with the condemnation and death of T. Menenius, bythe good offices of whose father the commons were formerlyre-established, and were now in possession of those laws and thosemagistrates, by means of which they then exercised their insolence; hiscolleague Virginius also, who was brought forward as a witness, aidedhim by assigning to him a share of his own deserts; the condemnation ofMenenius however was of greater service to him (so much had they changedtheir minds)."Book 2,Chapter 53,"The contests at home were now concluded. A Veientian war broke out,with whom the Sabines had united their forces. The consul P. Valerius,after auxiliaries were sent for from the Latins and Hernicians, beingdespatched to Veii with an army, immediately attacks the Sabine camp,which had been pitched before the walls of their allies: and occasionedsuch great consternation, that while, dispersed in different directions,they sally forth to repel the assault of the enemy, the gate which theRomans first attacked was taken; then within the rampart there wasrather a carnage than a battle. From the camp the alarm spreads into thecity; the Veientians run to arms in as great a panic as if Veii had beentaken: some come up to the support of the Sabines, others fall upon theRomans, who had directed all their force against the camp. For a littlewhile they were disconcerted and thrown into confusion; then they tooforming two fronts make a stand: and the cavalry, being commanded by theconsul to charge, routs the Etrurians and puts them to flight; and inthe same hour two armies and two of the most influential and powerful ofthe neighbouring states were vanquished. Whilst these transactions aregoing on at Veii, the Volsci and ®qui had pitched their camp in theLatin territory, and laid waste their frontiers. The Latins, by theirown exertions, being joined by the Hernicians, without either a Romangeneral or Roman auxiliaries, stripped them of their camp. Besidesrecovering their own effects, they obtained immense booty. The consul C.Nautius, however, was sent against the Volsci from Rome. The custom, Isuppose, was not pleasing for allies to carry on wars with their ownforces and under their own direction without a Roman general and troops.There was no kind of injury or indignity that was not practised againstthe Volsci; nor could they be prevailed on however to come to anengagement in the field."Book 2,Chapter 54,"Lucius Furius and Caius Manlius were the next consuls. TheVeientians fell to Manlius as his province. War however did not takeplace: a truce for forty years was granted them at their request, cornand pay for the soldiers being demanded of them. Disturbance at homeimmediately succeeds to peace abroad: the commons were goaded by thetribunes with the excitement of the agrarian law. The consuls, nothingintimidated by the condemnation of Menenius, nor by the danger ofServilius, resist with their utmost might; Cn. Genucius, a tribune ofthe people, arraigned the consuls on their going out of office. Lucius®milius and Opiter Virginius enter on the consulate. Instead ofVirginius I find Vopiscus Julius consul in some annals. In this year(whatever consuls it had) Furius and Manlius, being summoned to trialbefore the people, go about in suppliant garb not more to the commonsthan to the younger patricians; they advise, they caution them ""to keepthemselves from honours and the administration of public affairs, andthat they would consider the consular fasces, the pr¾texta and curulechair, as nothing else than the decorations of a funeral; that whencovered with these fine insignia, as with fillets, they were doomed todeath. But if the charms of the consulate were so great, they shouldrest satisfied that the consulate was held in captivity and crushed bythe tribunitian power; that every thing was to be done at the nod andcommand of the tribune by the consul, as if he were a tribune's beadle.If he stir, if he have reference to the patricians, if he should thinkfor a moment that there existed any other party in the state but thecommons, let him place before his eyes the banishment of Caius Marcius,the condemnation and death of Menenius."" Fired by these discourses, thepatricians from that time held their consultations not in public, but inprivate, and withdrawn from the knowledge of the many; where when thisone point was agreed on, that the accused must be rescued whether byjust or unjust means, every proposition that was most desperate was mostapproved; nor was an actor wanted for any deed however daring.Accordingly on the day of trial, when the people stood in the forum inanxious expectation, they at first began to feel surprised that thetribune did not come down; then when the delay was now becoming moresuspicious, they considered that he was deterred by the nobles, and theycomplained that the public cause was abandoned and betrayed. At lengththose who had been waiting before the gate of the tribune's residence,bring word that he was found dead in his house. As soon as rumour spreadthis through the whole assembly, just as an army disperses on the fallof its general, so did they separate in different directions. Theprincipal panic seized the tribunes, now warned by their colleague'sdeath what little aid the devoting laws afforded them. Nor did thepatricians bear their joy with sufficient moderation; and so far was anyof them from feeling compunction at the guilty act, that even those whowere innocent wished to be considered to have perpetrated it, and it wasopenly declared that the tribunitian power should be subdued bychastisement."Book 2,Chapter 55,"Immediately after this victory of a most ruinous precedent a levy isproclaimed; and the tribunes being now overawed, the consuls accomplishthe matter without any opposition. Then indeed the commons becameenraged more on account of the silence of the tribunes than the commandof the consuls: and they said ""there was an end of their liberty; thatthey were come back again to the old condition of things; that thetribunitian power had died along with Genucius and was buried with him;that other means must be devised and practised, by which to resist thepatricians; and that the only method for that was that the people shoulddefend themselves, since they now had no other aid. That four-and-twentylictors waited on the consuls; and that these very individuals were fromamong the commons; that nothing could be more despicable, nor weaker, ifthere were only persons who could despise them; that each personmagnified those things and made them objects of terror to himself."" Whenthey had excited each other by these discourses, a lictor was despatchedby the consuls to Volero Publilius, a man belonging to the commons,because he stated, that having been a centurion he ought not to be madea common soldier. Volero appeals to the tribunes. When one came to hisassistance, the consuls order the man to be stripped and the rods to begot ready. ""I appeal to the people,"" says Volero, ""since tribunes hadrather see a Roman citizen scourged before their eyes, than themselvesbe butchered by you in their bed."" The more vehemently he cried out, themore violently did the lictor tear off his clothes and strip him. ThenVolero, being both himself of great bodily strength, and being aided byhis partisans, having repulsed the lictor, when the shouts of thoseindignant in his behalf became very intense, betook himself into thethickest part of the crowd, crying out, ""I appeal, and implore theprotection of the commons; assist me, fellow citizens; assist me, fellowsoldiers; there is no use in waiting for the tribunes, who themselvesstand in need of your aid."" The men, being much excited, prepare as itwere for battle; and it became manifest that there was urgent danger,that nothing would be held sacred by any one, that there would no longerexist any public or private right. When the consuls faced this soviolent storm, they soon experienced that majesty without strength hadbut little security; the lictors being maltreated, the fasces broken,they are driven from the forum into the senate-house, uncertain how farVolero would push his victory. After that, the disturbance subsiding,when they had ordered the senate to be convened, they complain of theoutrages committed on themselves, of the violence of the people, thedaring of Volero. Many violent measures having been proposed, the eldermembers prevailed, who recommended that the unthinking rashness of thecommons should not be met by the passionate resentment of thepatricians."Book 2,Chapter 56,"The commons having espoused the interest of Volero, with greatwarmth choose him, at the next election, tribune of the people for thatyear, which had Lucius Pinarius and Publius Furius for consuls; and,contrary to the opinion of all men, who thought that he would let loosehis tribuneship in harassing the consuls of the preceding year,postponing private resentment to the public interest, without assailingthe consuls even by a single word, he proposed a law to the people thatplebeian magistrates should be elected at the comitia by tribes. Amatter of no trifling moment was now being brought forward, under anaspect at first sight by no means alarming; but one which in realitydeprived the patricians of all power to elect whatever tribunes theypleased by the suffrages of their clients. The patricians used all theirenergies in resisting this proposition, which was most pleasing to thecommons; and though none of the college could be induced by theinfluence either of the consuls or of the chief members of the senate toenter a protest against it, the only means of resistance which nowexisted; yet the matter, important as it was by its own weight, is spunout by contention till the following year. The commons re-elect Voleroas tribune. The senators, considering that the question would be carriedto the very extreme of a struggle, elect to the consulate AppiusClaudius, the son of Appius, who was both hated by and hated thecommons, ever since the contests between them and his father. TitusQuintius is assigned to him as his colleague. In the very commencementof the year no other question took precedence of that regarding the law.But though Volero was the inventor of it, his colleague, L¾torius, wasboth a more recent abettor of it, as well as a more energetic one.Whilst Volero confined himself to the subject of the law, avoiding allabuse of the consuls, he commenced with accusing Appius and his family,as having ever been most overbearing and cruel towards the Romancommons, contending that he had been elected by the senators, not asconsul, but as executioner, to harass and torture the people; his rudetongue, he being a military man, was not sufficient to express thefreedom of his sentiments. Language therefore failing him, he says,""Romans, since I do not speak with as much readiness as I make good whatI have spoken, attend here to-morrow. I will either die here before youreyes, or will carry the law."" On the following day the tribunes takepossession of the temple; the consuls and the nobility take their placesin the assembly to obstruct the law. L¾torius orders all persons to beremoved, except those going to vote; the young nobles kept their places,paying no regard to the officer; then L¾torius orders some of them to beseized. The consul Appius insisted ""that the tribune had no jurisdictionover any one except a plebeian; for that he was not a magistrate of thepeople in general, but only of the commons; for that even he himselfcould not, according to the usage of their ancestors, by virtue of hisauthority remove any person; because the words run thus, _if ye thinkproper, depart, Romans_."" He was able to disconcert L¾torius by arguingfluently and contemptuously concerning the right. The tribune therefore,burning with rage, sends his beadle to the consul; the consul sends hislictor to the tribune, exclaiming that he was a private individual,without power and without magistracy; and the tribune would have beenroughly treated, had not both the entire assembly risen up with greatwarmth in behalf of the tribune against the consul, and a rush ofpersons belonging to the multitude, which was now much excited, takenplace from the entire city into the forum. Appius, however, withstoodso great a storm with obstinacy, and the contest would have ended in abattle, not without blood, had not Quintius, the other consul, aftergiving it in charge to the men of consular dignity to remove hiscolleague from the forum by force, if they could not do it otherwise,himself assuaged the enraged people by entreaties, and implored thetribunes to dismiss the assembly. ""That they should give their passiontime to cool; that delay would not deprive them of their power, butwould add prudence to strength; and that the senators would be under thecontrol of the people, and the consul under that of the senators."""Book 2,Chapter 57,"With difficulty the people were pacified by Quintius: with much moredifficulty was the other consul by the patricians. The assembly of thepeople being at length dismissed, the consuls convene the senate; where,though fear and resentment by turns had produced a diversity ofopinions, the more they were recalled, after the lapse of time, fromviolence to reflection, the more averse did they become to a continuanceof the dispute, so that they returned thanks to Quintius, because by hisexertions the disturbance had been quieted. Appius is requested ""toconsent that the consular dignity should be merely so great as it couldbe in a peaceably conducted state; that as long as the tribune andconsuls were drawing all power, each to his own side, no strength wasleft between; that the object aimed at was in whose hands thecommonwealth should be, distracted and torn as it was, rather than thatit should be safe."" Appius, on the contrary, called gods and men towitness that ""the commonwealth was betrayed and abandoned throughcowardice; that it was not the consul that was wanting to the senate,but the senate to the consul; that more oppressive laws were now beingsubmitted to than were sanctioned on the sacred mount."" Overcome howeverby the unanimous feeling of the senators, he desisted: the law iscarried without opposition."Book 2,Chapter 58,"Then for the first time the tribunes were elected in the comitia bytribes. Piso said that three were added to the number, whereas there hadbeen only two before. He names the tribunes also, Caius Sicinius, LuciusNumitorius, Marcus Duilius, Spurius Icilius, Lucius Mecilius. During thedisturbance at Rome, a war with the Volscians and ®quans broke out; theyhad laid waste the lands, so that if any secession of the people shouldtake place, they might find a refuge with them. The differences beingafterwards settled, they removed their camp backwards. Appius Claudiuswas sent against the Volscians; the ®quans fell to Quintius as hisprovince. The severity of Appius was the same in war as at home, beingmore unrestrained because he was free from tribunitian control. He hatedthe commons with more than his father's hatred: he had been defeated bythem: when he was set up as the only consul to oppose the tribunitianinfluence, a law was passed, which former consuls obstructed with lesseffort, amid hopes of the senators by no means so great (as those formedof him). His resentment and indignation at this, excited his imperioustemper to harass the army by the rigour of his command; nor could it(the army) however be subdued by any means; such a spirit of oppositionhad they imbibed. They executed every measure slowly, indolently,negligently, and with stubbornness: neither shame nor fear restrainedthem. If he wished the army to move on with expedition, they designedlywent more slowly: if he came up to them to encourage them in their work,they all relaxed the energy which they before exerted of their ownaccord: when he was present they cast down their eyes, they silentlycursed him as he passed by; so that his mind, invulnerable to plebeianhatred, was sometimes moved. All kind of harsh treatment being tried invain, he no longer held any intercourse with the soldiers; he said thearmy was corrupted by the centurions; he sometimes gibingly called themtribunes of the people and Voleros."Book 2,Chapter 59,"None of these circumstances were unknown to the Volscians, and theypressed on with so much the more vigour, hoping that the Roman armywould entertain the same spirit of opposition against Appius, which theyhad formerly entertained against the consul Fabius. But they were muchmore violent against Appius than against Fabius. For they were not onlyunwilling to conquer, like Fabius' army, but they wished to beconquered. When led out to the field, they made for their camp in anignominious flight, nor did they stand their ground until they saw theVolscians advancing to their fortifications, and making dreadful havocon the rear of their army. Then the obligation to fight was wrung fromthem, in order that the victorious enemy should be dislodged from theirlines; yet it was sufficiently plain that the Roman soldiers were onlyunwilling that their camp should be taken; some of them gloried in theirown defeat and disgrace. When the determined spirit of Appius, undauntedby these things, wished to exercise severity still further, and hesummoned a meeting, the lieutenant-generals and tribunes flock aroundhim, advising him ""that he would not determine on venturing a trial ofan authority, the entire strength of which lay in the acquiescence ofthose who were to obey. That the soldiers generally refused to come tothe assembly, and that their clamours were heard in every directiondemanding that the camp should be removed from the Volscian territory.That the victorious enemy were but a little time ago almost at the verygates and rampart; and that not merely a suspicion, but a manifestindication of a grievous disaster presented itself to their eyes.""Yielding at length, (since they would gain nothing save a delay ofpunishment,) having prorogued the assembly, after he had given ordersthat their march should be proclaimed for the following day, he, at thefirst dawn, gave the signal for departure by sound of trumpet. When thearmy, having just got clear of the camp, were forming themselves, theVolscians, as being aroused by the same signal, fall upon those in therear; from whom the alarm spreading to the van, confounded both thebattalions and ranks with such consternation, that neither the generals'orders could be distinctly heard, nor the lines be drawn up, no onethinking of any thing but flight. In such confusion did they make theirway through heaps of dead bodies and of arms, that the enemy ceased topursue sooner than the Romans to fly. The soldiers being at lengthcollected from their scattered rout, the consul, after he had in vainfollowed his men for the purpose of rallying them, pitched his camp in apeaceful part of the country; and an assembly being convened, afterinveighing not without good reason against the army, as traitors tomilitary discipline, deserters of their posts, frequently asking them,one by one, where were their standards, where their arms; he first beatwith rods and then beheaded those soldiers who had thrown down theirarms, the standard-bearers who had lost their standards, and moreoverthe centurions, and those with the double allowance, who had left theirranks. With respect to the rest of the multitude, every tenth man wasdrawn by lot for punishment."Book 2,Chapter 60,"In a contrary manner to this, the consul and soldiers in the countryof the ®quans vied with each other in courtesy and acts of kindness:both Quintius was naturally milder in disposition, and the ill-fatedseverity of his colleague caused him to indulge more in his own goodtemper. This, such great cordiality between the general and his army,the ®quans did not venture to meet; they suffered the enemy to gothrough their lands committing devastations in every direction. Nor weredepredations committed more extensively in that quarter in any precedingwar. Praises were also added, in which the minds of soldiers find noless pleasure than in rewards. The army returned more reconciled both totheir general, and also on account of the general to the patricians;stating that a parent was assigned to them, a master to the other armyby the senate. The year now passed, with varied success in war, andfurious dissensions at home and abroad, was rendered memorable chieflyby the elections by tribes; the matter was more important from thevictory in the contest entered into, than from any real advantage; forthere was more of dignity abstracted from the elections themselves bythe exclusion of the patricians, than there was influence either addedto the commons or taken from the patricians."Book 2,Chapter 61,"A more turbulent year[99] next followed, Lucius Valerius, Tiberius®milius being consuls, both by reason of the struggles between thedifferent orders concerning the agrarian law, as well as on account ofthe trial of Appius Claudius; for whom, as a most active opposer of thelaw, and as one who supported the cause of the possessors of the publicland, as if a third consul, Marcus Duilius and Caius Sicinius appointeda day of trial.[100] Never before was an accused person so hateful tothe commons brought to trial before the people; overwhelmed with theirresentment on his own account,[101] and also on account of his father.The patricians too seldom made equal exertions in behalf of any one:""that the champion of the senate, and the assertor of their dignity,opposed to all the storms of the tribunes and commons, was exposed tothe resentment of the commons, merely for having exceeded bounds in thecontest."" Appius Claudius himself was the only one of the patricians whomade light both of the tribunes and commons and his own trial. Neitherthe threats of the commons, nor the entreaties of the senate, could everpersuade him not only to change his garb, or address persons as asuppliant, but not even so far as to soften or relax any thing from theusual asperity of his style, when his cause was to be pleaded before thepeople. The expression of his countenance was the same; the samestubbornness in his looks, the same spirit of pride in his language; sothat a great part of the commons felt no less awe of Appius whenarraigned, than they had felt of him when consul. He pleaded his causeonce, and with the same spirit of an accuser which he had beenaccustomed to adopt on all occasions: and he so far astounded both thetribunes and the commons by his intrepidity, that, of their own accord,they postponed the day of trial; then they allowed the matter to beprotracted. Nor was the time now very distant; before, however, theappointed day came, he dies of some disease; and when the tribunes ofthe people endeavoured to impede his funeral panegyric,[102] the commonswould not allow that the last day of so great a man should be defraudedof the usual honours; and they listened to the panegyric of him whendead with as patient ears, as they had listened to the charges broughtagainst him when living, and attended his funeral in vast numbers."Book 2,Chapter 62,"In the same year the consul Valerius, having marched an army againstthe ®quans, when he could not entice the enemy to an engagement, setabout assaulting their camp. A violent storm sent down from heaven withthunder and hail prevented him. Then, on a signal for a retreat beinggiven, their surprise was excited by the return of such fair weather,that they felt a scruple a second time to attack a camp which wasdefended as it were by some divine power; all the rage of war was turnedon the devastation of the land. The other consul, ®milius, conducted thewar against the Sabines. There also, because the enemy confinedthemselves within their walls, the lands were laid waste. Then, by theburning not only of the country-houses, but of the villages also, whichwere thickly inhabited, the Sabines being aroused, after they met thedepredators, on retreating from an engagement left undecided, on thefollowing day removed their camp into a safer situation. This seemed asufficient reason to the consul why he should leave the enemy asconquered, departing thence the war being still unfinished."Book 2,Chapter 63,"During these wars, whilst dissensions still continued at home, TitusNumicius Priscus, Aulus Virginius, were elected consuls. The commonsappeared determined no longer to brook a delay of the agrarian law, andextreme violence was on the eve of being resorted to, when it wasascertained from the burning of the country-houses and the flight of thepeasants that the Volscians were at hand: this circumstance checked thesedition that was now ripe and almost breaking out. The consuls, havingbeen instantly forced to the war by the senate,[103] after leading forththe youth from the city, rendered the rest of the commons more quiet.And the enemy indeed, having done nothing else except alarming theRomans by groundless fear, depart with great precipitation. Numiciusmarched to Antium against the Volscians, Virginius against the ®quans.Here a signal overthrow being well nigh received from an ambuscade, thebravery of the soldiers restored (the Roman) superiority, which had beenendangered through the carelessness of the consul. The general conductedaffairs better against the Volscians. The enemy were routed in the firstengagement, and forced to fly into the city of Antium, a very wealthyplace considering those times; the consul, not venturing to attack it,took from the people of Antium another town, Ceno, which was by no meansso wealthy. Whilst the ®quans and Volscians engage the attention of theRoman armies, the Sabines advanced in their devastations even to thegates of the city: then they themselves, a few days after, received fromthe two armies heavier losses than they had occasioned, the two consulshaving entered their territories under exasperated feelings."Book 2,Chapter 64,"Towards the close of the year there was some peace, but, asfrequently at other times, disturbed by contests between the patriciansand commons. The exasperated commons refused to attend the consularelections: Titus Quintius, Quintus Servilius, were elected consuls bythe patricians and their dependents: the consuls have a year similar tothe preceding, the commencement embroiled, and afterwards tranquil byexternal war. The Sabines marching across the plains of Crustuminum withgreat rapidity, after carrying fire and sword along the banks of theAnio, being repulsed when they had come up nearly to the Colline gateand the walls, drove off however great booty of men and cattle: theconsul Servilius, having pursued them with a determined army, was unableto come up with the main body itself on the campaign country; he carriedhis devastation however so extensively, that he left nothing unmolestedby war, and returned after obtaining plunder much exceeding that carriedoff by the enemy. The public interest was supported extremely wellagainst the Volscians also by the exertions as well of the general as ofthe soldiers. First they fought a pitched battle, on equal ground, withgreat slaughter and much bloodshed on both sides: and the Romans,because the fewness of their numbers was more likely to make the lossfelt, would have given way, had not the consul, by a well-timed fiction,re-animated the army, crying out that the enemy were flying on the otherwing; making a charge, they, by supposing that they were victorious,became so. The consul, fearing lest by pressing too far he might renewthe contest, gave the signal for a retreat. A few days intervened; restbeing taken on both sides as if by a tacit suspension of arms; duringthese days a vast number of persons from all the states of the Volsciansand ®quans came to the camp, certain that the Romans would depart duringthe night, if they should perceive them. Accordingly about the thirdwatch they come to attack the camp. Quintius having allayed theconfusion which the sudden panic had occasioned, after ordering thesoldiers to remain quiet in their tents, leads out a cohort of theHernicians for an advance guard: the trumpeters and horneteers he mountson horseback, and commands them to sound their trumpets before therampart, and to keep the enemy in suspense till daylight: during therest of the night every thing was so quiet in the camp, that the Romanshad even the advantage of sleep. The sight of the armed infantry, whomthey both considered to be more numerous than they were, and to beRomans, the bustle and neighing of the horses, which became restless,both from the strange riders placed on them, and moreover from the soundof the trumpets frightening them, kept the Volscians intently awaitingan attack of the enemy."Book 2,Chapter 65,"When day dawned, the Romans, invigorated and refreshed with sleep,on being marched out to battle, at the first onset overpowered theVolscians, wearied from standing and want of rest; though the enemyrather retired than were routed, because in the rear there were hills towhich there was a secure retreat, the ranks behind the first line beingunbroken. The consul, when they came to the uneven ground, halts hisarmy; the soldiers were kept back with difficulty; they cried out anddemanded to be allowed to pursue the enemy now discomfited. The cavalry,crowding around the general, proceed more violently: they cry out thatthey would proceed before the first line. Whilst the consul hesitates,relying on the valour of his men, yet having little confidence in theplace, they all cry out that they would proceed; and execution followedthe shout. Fixing their spears in the ground, in order that they may belighter to ascend the steeps, they run upwards. The Volscians, havingdischarged their missile weapons at the first onset, fling the stoneslying at their feet on them as they advanced upwards, and having thrownthem into confusion by incessant blows, they drove them from the higherground: thus the left wing of the Romans was nearly overborne, had notthe consul dispelled their fear by exciting a sense of shame as theywere just retreating, chiding at the same time their temerity and theircowardice. At first they stood their ground with determined firmness;then, according as their strength carried them against those inpossession of the ground, they venture to advance themselves; and byrenewing the shout they encourage the whole body to move on; then againmaking a new effort, they force their way up and surmount thedisadvantage of the ground. They were on the point of gaining the summitof the eminence, when the enemy turned their backs, and the pursued andpursuers with precipitate speed rushed into the camp almost in a body.In this consternation the camp is taken; such of the Volscians as wereable to make their escape, take the road to Antium. The Roman army alsowas led to Antium; after being invested for a few days it surrenderswithout any additional force of the besiegers,[104] but because theirspirits had sunk ever since the unsuccessful battle and the loss oftheir camp."Book 3,Chapter 1,"After the taking of Antium, Titus ®milius and Quintus Fabius areelected consuls. This was the Fabius Quintus who alone had survived thefamily cut off at Cremera. Already, in his former consulate, ®milius hadbeen an adviser of giving land to the people. Accordingly in his secondconsulate also both the abettors of the agrarian law had raisedthemselves to the hope of carrying the measure, and the tribunes,supposing that a matter frequently attempted in opposition to bothconsuls might be obtained with the assistance at least of one consul,take it up, and the consul remained stedfast in his sentiments. Thepossessors and a considerable part of the patricians complaining that aperson at the head of the state was recommending himself by histribunitial proceedings, and that he was making himself popular bygiving away other persons' property, had transferred the odium of theentire affair from the tribunes to the consul. A violent contest was athand, had not Fabius set the matter straight, by an expedientdisagreeable to neither party, ""that under the conduct and auspices ofTitus Quintius, there was a considerable tract of land taken thepreceding year from the Volscians; that a colony might be sent toAntium, a neighbouring, convenient, and maritime city; that the commonsmight come in for lands without any complaints of the present occupiers,that the state might remain in quiet."" This proposition was accepted. Heappoints as triumvirs for distributing the land, Titus Quintius, AulusVirginius, and Publius Furius: those who wished to obtain land wereordered to give in their names. The gratification of their aim begatdisgust, as usually happens; so few gave in their names that Volsciancolonists were added to fill up the number: the rest of the peoplepreferred clamouring for land in Rome, rather than receive it elsewhere.The ®quans sued for peace from Quintus Fabius, (he was sent thither withan army,) and they themselves broke it by a sudden incursion into theLatin territory."Book 3,Chapter 2,"In the following year Quintus Servilius, (for he was consul withSpurius Posthumius,) being sent against the ®quans, fixed his camp inthe Latin territory: inaction necessarily kept the army within the camp,involved as they were in a distemper. The war was protracted to thethird year, Quintus Fabius and Titus Quintius being consuls. To Fabius,because he, as conqueror, had granted[105] peace to the ®quans, thatprovince was assigned by an extraordinary commission: who, setting outwith certain hope that the fame of his name would reduce the ®quans tosubmission, sent ambassadors to the council of the nation, and orderedthem to say ""that Quintus Fabius, the consul, stated that he had broughtpeace to Rome from the ®quans, that from Rome he now brought war to the®quans, that same right hand being armed, which he had formerly given tothem in amity; that the gods were now witnesses, and would presently beavengers of those by whose perfidy and perjury that was brought to pass.That he, however, be matters as they might, would even now prefer thatthe ®quans should repent of their own accord than be subject to thevengeance of an enemy. If they repent, that there would be a saferetreat in that clemency already experienced; but if they stilldelighted in perjury, they would wage war with the angry gods ratherthan with enemies."" This statement had so little effect on any of them,that the ambassadors were near being ill-treated, and an army was sentto Algidum against the Romans. When these tidings were brought to Rome,the indignity of the affair, rather than the danger, called out theother consul from the city; thus two consular armies advanced againstthe enemy in order of battle, so that they might at once engage. But asit so happened that much of the day did not now remain, a person fromthe advanced guard of the enemy cries out, ""This is making a display ofwar, Romans, not waging it; you draw up your army in line of battle,when night is at hand; we require a greater length of day-light for thecontest which is to come on. To-morrow by sun-rise return to the field:you shall have an opportunity of fighting, never fear."" The soldiers,stung by these threats, are marched back into the camp till thefollowing day; thinking that the approaching night was tedious, whichwould cause delay to the contest. Then indeed they refresh their bodieswith food and sleep: on the following day, when it was light, the Romanarmy took their post considerably sooner. At length the ®quans also cameforward. The battle was obstinate on both sides, because both the Romansfought under the influence of resentment and hatred; and a consciousnessof danger brought on by misconduct, and despair of obtaining futureconfidence afterwards, obliged the ®quans to exert and have recourse tothe most desperate efforts. The ®quans however did not withstand theRoman troops, and when on being beaten they had betaken themselves totheir own territories, the outrageous multitude, with dispositions notat all more disposed to peace, began to chide their leaders: ""that theirinterest was committed to the hazard of a pitched battle, in which modeof fighting the Romans were superior. That the ®quans were better fittedfor depredations and incursions, and that several parties acting indifferent directions conducted wars more successfully than the unwieldymass of one single army."""Book 3,Chapter 3,"Having left therefore a guard on the camp, they marched out andattacked the Roman frontiers with such fury, as to carry terror even tothe city: the unexpected nature of the thing also caused more alarm,because nothing could be less apprehended, than that an enemy,vanquished and almost besieged in their camp, should entertain a thoughtof depredation: and the peasants, in a panic pouring in at the gates,cried out, that it was not mere plundering, nor small parties ofdepredators, but, exaggerating every thing through groundless fear, thatwhole armies and legions of the enemy were advancing, and that they werepushing forward to the city determined for an assault. Those who werenearest (the gates) carried to others the accounts heard from these,uncertain as they were, and therefore the more groundless; and the hurryand confused clamour of those calling to arms bore no distantresemblance to the panic of a city taken by storm. It so happened thatthe consul Quintius had returned to Rome from Algidum; this was somerelief for their terror; and the tumult being calmed, and after chidingthem for being in dread of a vanquished enemy, he posted a guard on thegates. Then having convened the senate, when he set out to defend thefrontiers, a suspension[106] of civil business having been proclaimed bya decree of the senate, leaving Quintus Servilius behind as prefect ofthe city, he found no enemy in the country. Matters were conducted withdistinguished success by the other consul; who having attacked theenemy, wherever he knew that they were to come, laden with booty, andproceeding therefore with their army the more encumbered, made theirdepredation prove fatal to them. Few of the enemy escaped from theambuscade; all the booty was recovered; thus the return of the consulQuintius to the city put a termination to the justitium, which lastedonly four days. A census was then held, and the lustrum was closed byQuintius: the number of citizens rated are said to have been one hundredand twenty-four thousand two hundred and fourteen, besides orphans ofboth sexes. Nothing memorable occurred afterwards among the ®quans; theybetook themselves into their towns, suffering their possessions to beconsumed by fire and to be devastated. The consul, after he hadrepeatedly carried depredation through the entire country of the enemy,returned to Rome with great glory and booty."Book 3,Chapter 4,"Then Aulus Posthumius Albus and Spurius Furius Fusus were consuls.Furii some writers have written Fusii; this I mention, lest any one mayimagine that the change, which is only in the names, may be in thepersons themselves. There was no doubt but that one of the consuls wouldcommence hostilities against the ®quans. The ®quans accordingly soughtaid from the Volscians of Ecetra; which being granted readily, (sokeenly did these states vie in inveterate hatred against the Romans,)preparations for war were made with the utmost vigour. The Hernicianscame to the knowledge of it, and warned the Romans that the Ecetrans hadrevolted to the ®quans; the colony of Antium also was suspected, becausewhen the town was taken, a great number of the inhabitants had fledthence for refuge to the ®quans: and these proved the bravest soldiersduring the war with the ®quans. Afterwards the ®quans being driven intothe towns, this rabble withdrawing privately, when they returned toAntium, seduced from the Romans the colonists who were already disposedto treachery of their own accord. The matter not being yet ripe, when itwas announced to the senate that a defection was intended, the consulswere charged to inquire into the business by summoning to Rome theleading men of the colony. When those persons attended withoutreluctance, being conducted to the senate by the consuls, they soanswered to the questions put to them, that they were dismissed moresuspected than they had come. Upon this war was considered asinevitable. Spurius Fusius, one of the consuls to whom that province hadfallen, having marched against the ®quans, found the enemy committingdepredations in the country of the Hernicians; and being ignorant oftheir numbers, because they had never been seen all together, he rashlyhazarded an engagement with an army not a match for their forces. Beingbeaten from his ground at the first onset, he betook himself to hiscamp: nor was that an end of the danger: for both on the next night andthe following day, his camp was beset and assaulted with such vigour,that not even a messenger could be sent from thence to Rome. TheHernicians brought an account both that a defeat had taken place, andthat the army was besieged: and they struck such terror into the senate,that a charge was given to the other consul Posthumius, that he should""take care that the commonwealth sustained no injury,""[107] which formof a decree has ever been deemed to be one of extreme exigency. Itseemed most advisable that the consul himself should remain at Rome toenlist all who were able to bear arms: that Titus Quintius should besent as pro-consul[108] to the relief of the camp with the army of theallies: to complete that army the Latins and Hernicians, and the colonyof Antium, were ordered to supply Quintius with subitary soldiers (sothey then called auxiliaries raised for sudden emergencies)."Book 3,Chapter 5,"During those days many movements and many attempts were made oneither side, because the enemy, having the advantage in numbers,attempted to weaken the Roman strength by dividing it into many parts,as not being likely to suffice for all points of attack. At the sametime the camp was besieged, at the same time a part of the army was sentto devastate the Roman territory, and to attempt the city itself, iffortune should favour. Lucius Valerius was left to guard the city: theconsul Postumius was sent to repel the attacks on the frontiers. Therewas no abatement in any part either in vigilance or activity; watches inthe city, out-posts before the gates, and guards stationed along thewalls: and a justitium was observed for several days (a thing which wasnecessary in such general confusion). In the mean time the consulFurius, after he had at first passively endured the siege in his camp,burst forth from the Decuman gate on the enemy when off their guard; andthough he might have pursued them, he stopped through fear, lest anattack should be made on the camp from the other side. Thelieutenant-general Furius (he was the consul's brother) was carried awaytoo far by his ardour; nor did he, from his eagerness to pursue, observehis own party returning, nor the attack of the enemy on his rear: thusbeing shut out, after repeatedly making many unavailing efforts to forcehis way to the camp, he fell, fighting bravely. And the consul, turningabout to renew the fight, on hearing the account that his brother wassurrounded, rushing into the thick of the fight rather rashly than withsufficient caution, received a wound, and was with difficulty rescued bythose around him. This both damped the courage of his own men, andrendered the enemy more daring; who, being encouraged by the death ofthe lieutenant-general, and by the consul's wound, could not afterwardsbe withstood by any force, so as to prevent the Romans from being drivenwithin their camp and again submitting to a siege, as being a match forthem neither in hopes nor in strength; and every thing would have beenendangered, had not T. Quintius come to their relief with foreign troopsfrom the Latin and Hernician army. He attacked the ®quans on their rearwhilst intent on the Roman camp, and insultingly displaying the head ofthe lieutenant-general, and, a sally being made at the same time fromthe camp on a signal given at a distance by him, he surrounded a greatnumber of the enemy. Of the ®quans on the Roman territory the slaughterwas less, their dispersion was more complete. On these as they straggledin different directions, and were driving plunder before them, Postumiusmade an attack in several places, where he had posted convenientdetachments; these straying about and pursuing their flight in greatdisorder, fell in with the victorious Quintius as he was returning withthe wounded consul. Then did the consular army by their distinguishedbravery take ample vengeance for the consul's wound, and for the deathof the lieutenant-general and the cohorts; heavy losses were bothinflicted and received on both sides during those days. In a matter ofsuch antiquity it is difficult to state with certainty the exact numberof those who fought or fell: Antias Valerius, however, ventures to sumthem up; that in the Hernician territory there fell five thousand threehundred Romans; that of the predatory parties of the ®quans, who strayedthrough the Roman frontiers for the purpose of plundering, two thousandfour hundred were slain by the consul Postumius; that the rest of thebody that were driving booty before them, and which fell in withQuintius, by no means got off with so light a loss: that of these fourthousand, and by way of stating the number exactly, two hundred andthirty, were slain. After this they returned to Rome; the order for thejustitium was discharged. The sky seemed to be all on fire; and otherprodigies either actually presented themselves to their sight, orexhibited imaginary appearances to their affrighted minds. To avertthese terrors, a solemn festival of three days was proclaimed, duringwhich, all the temples were filled with a crowd of men and women,earnestly imploring the protection of the gods. After this the Latin andHernician cohorts were sent back to their respective homes, thankshaving been returned to them for their spirited military services. Thethousand soldiers from Antium were dismissed almost with disgrace,because they had come after the battle with assistance then too late."Book 3,Chapter 6,"The elections were then held: Lucius ®butius and Publius Serviliusbeing elected consuls, enter on their office on the calends of August,which was then considered as the commencement of the year.[109] This wasa distressing time, and it so happened that the season was pestilentialto the city and country, and not more to men than to cattle; and theyincreased the malignity of the distemper, by admitting[110] the cattleand the peasants into the city through dread of devastation. Thiscollection of animals of every kind mixed together, distressed both thecitizens by the unusual stench, and the peasants crowded together intotheir close apartments, with heat, want of sleep, and their attendanceon each other, and contact itself propagated the disease. Whilst withdifficulty sustaining these calamities, ambassadors from the Hernicianssuddenly bring word that the ®quans and Volscians, having united theirforces, had pitched their camp in their territory, that from thence theywere depopulating their frontiers with an immense army. Besides that thethinness of the senate was a proof to the allies that the state wasprostrated by the pestilence, they further received this melancholyanswer: ""That the Hernicians, with the Latins, must now defend theirpossessions by their own exertions. That the Roman city, through thesudden anger of the gods, was now depopulated by disease. If any respitefrom that calamity should come, that they would afford aid to theirallies, as they had done the year before, and always on otheroccasions."" The allies departed, carrying home, instead of themelancholy news (they had brought), news still more melancholy, as beingpersons who were now obliged to sustain by their own means a war, whichthey had sustained with difficulty when backed by the power of Rome. Theenemy did not confine themselves any longer to the Hernician territory.They proceed thence with determined hostility into the Romanterritories, which were already devastated without the injuries of war.Where, when there was no one to meet them, not even an unarmed person,and they passed through every place destitute not only of troops, buteven of the cultivation of the husbandman, they reached as far as thethird stone on the Gabinian road. ®butius, the Roman consul, was dead;his colleague, Servilius, was dragging out life with slender hope ofrecovery; most of the leading men, the chief part of the patricians, allof the military age, were lying sick, so that strength was wanting notonly for the expeditions, which, amid such an alarm the conjuncturerequired, but scarcely had they sufficient even for quietly mountingguard. The senators whose age and health permitted them, dischargedpersonally the duty of sentinels. The going around[111] and attending tothese was assigned to the ¾diles of the people; on them devolved thechief administration of affairs and the majesty of the consularauthority."Book 3,Chapter 7,"The commonwealth thus desolate, without a head, without strength, theguardian gods and good fortune of the city saved, which inspired theVolscians and ®quans with the disposition of banditti rather than ofenemies; for so far was any hope not only of taking but even ofapproaching the walls of Rome[112] from taking possession of theirminds, and so thoroughly did the sight of the houses in the distance,and the adjacent hills, divert their thoughts, (from such an attempt,)that, a murmur having arisen in every direction throughout the entirecamp, ""why they should waste time in indolence without booty in a wildand desert land, amid the putrid decay of cattle and of human beings,when they might repair to places uninjured by infection, the Tusculanterritory abounding in wealth?"" they suddenly tore up their standards,and by journeys across the country, they passed through the Lavicanterritory to the Tusculan hills; and to that quarter was the wholeviolence and storm of the war directed. In the mean time the Herniciansand Latins, influenced not only by compassion but by shame, if theyneither gave opposition to the common enemy, when making for the cityof Rome with a hostile army, nor afforded any aid to their allies whenbesieged, march to Rome with their forces united. Where, when they didnot find the enemy, following their tracks as indicated by rumour, theymeet them as they are coming down from the Tusculan territory into theAlban valley: there a battle was fought under circumstances by no meansequal; and their fidelity proved by no means favourable to the alliesfor the present. The mortality at Rome by disease was not less than thatof the allies by the sword (of the enemy); the only surviving consuldies; other eminent characters also died, Marcus Valerius, TitusVirginius Rutilus, the augurs; Servius Sulpicius, principal curio; andthrough persons of inferior note the virulence of the disease spreadextensively: and the senate, destitute of human aid, directed thepeople's attention to the gods and to prayers; they were ordered to goto supplicate with their wives and children, and earnestly to implorethe protection of heaven. Besides that their own sufferings obliged eachto do so, when called on by public authority, they fill all the shrines;the prostrate matrons in every quarter sweeping the temples with theirhair, beg for a remission of the divine displeasure, and a terminationto the pestilence."Book 3,Chapter 8,"From this time, whether it was from the favour of the gods beingobtained, or that the more unhealthy season of the year was now passed,the bodies of the people having shaken off disease, gradually began tobe more healthy, and their attention being now directed to publicconcerns, when several interregna had expired, Publius ValeriusPublicola, on the third day after he had entered on his office ofinterrex, causes Lucretius Tricipitinus, and Titus Veturius Geminus, (orVelusius,) to be elected consuls. They enter on their consulship on thethird day of the Ides of August, the state being now sufficientlystrong, not only to repel a hostile attack, but even to act itself onthe offensive. Therefore when the Hernicians brought an account that theenemy had made an incursion into their frontiers, assistance was readilypromised; two consular armies were enlisted. Veturius was sent againstthe Volscians to carry on an offensive war. Tricipitinus being appointedto protect the territory of the allies from devastation, proceeds nofurther than into the country of the Hernicians. Veturius routs and putsto flight the enemy in the first engagement. A party of plundererswhich had marched over the Pr¾nestine mountains, and from thencedescended into the plains, escaped the notice of Lucretius, whilst helay encamped amongst the Hernicians. These laid waste all the countryaround Pr¾neste and Gabii: from the Gabinian territory they turn theircourse towards the heights of Tusculum; great alarm was excited in thecity of Rome also, more from the suddenness of the affair, than thatthere was not sufficient strength to repel violence. Quintus Fabius hadthe command in the city;[113] he, by arming the young men and postingguards, rendered things secure and tranquil. The enemy thereforecarrying off plunder from the adjacent places, not venturing to approachthe city, when they were returning by a circuitous route, their cautionbeing now more relaxed, in proportion as they removed to a greaterdistance from the enemy's city, fall in with the consul Lucretius, whohad already explored their motions, drawn up in battle-array anddetermined on an engagement. Accordingly having attacked them withpredetermined resolution whilst struck with sudden panic, thoughconsiderably fewer in numbers, they rout and put to flight theirnumerous army, and having driven them into the deep valleys, when anegress from thence was not easy, they surround them. There the Volsciannation was almost entirely cut off. In some histories I find thatthirteen thousand four hundred and seventy fell in the field and in thepursuit, that one thousand two hundred and fifty were taken alive, thattwenty-seven military standards were carried off; where, though theremay have been some exaggeration in the number, there certainly was greatslaughter. The victorious consul having obtained immense booty returnedto the same standing camp. Then the consuls join their camps. TheVolscians and ®quans also unite their shattered strength. This was thethird battle on that year; the same good fortune gave them victory; theenemy being beaten, their camp was also taken."Book 3,Chapter 9,"Thus affairs at Rome returned to their former state; and successesabroad immediately excited commotions in the city. Caius TerentillusArsa[114] was tribune of the people in that year: he, considering thatan opportunity was afforded for tribunitian intrigues during the absenceof the consuls, after railing against the arrogance of the patriciansfor several days before the people, inveighed chiefly against theconsular authority, as being exorbitant and intolerable in a free state:""for that, in name only, it was less invidious, in reality almost moreoppressive than that of kings. For that two masters had been adoptedinstead of one, with unbounded, unlimited power; who, themselvesunrestrained and unbridled, directed all the terrors of the law, and allkinds of severity against the commons."" Now, in order that thislicentious power might not continue perpetual, he would propose a law,that five persons be appointed to draw up laws regarding the consularpower. That the consul should use that right which the people may givehim over them; that they should not hold their own caprice andlicentiousness as law. This law being published, when the patriciansbecame afraid, lest, in the absence of the consuls, they should besubjected to the yoke, the senate is convened by Quintus Fabius, pr¾fectof the city, who inveighed so vehemently against the bill and the authorof it, that nothing was omitted of threats and intimidation, even thoughboth the consuls in all their exasperation surrounded the tribune, ""thathe had lain in wait, and, watching his opportunity, he made an attack onthe commonwealth. If the gods in their anger had given them any tribunelike him on the preceding year, during the pestilence and war, he couldnot have been withstood. Both the consuls being dead, and the exhaustedstate lying enfeebled in universal confusion, that he would haveproposed laws to abolish the consular government altogether from thestate; that he would have headed the Volscians and ®quans to attack thecity. What? if the consuls adopted any tyrannical or cruel proceedingsagainst any of the citizens, was it not competent to him to appoint aday of trial for him; to arraign him before those very judges againstany one of whom severity may have been exercised? That it was not theconsular authority but the tribunitian power that he was renderinghateful and insupportable: which having been peaceable and reconciled tothe patricians, was now about to be brought back anew to its formermischievous habits. Nor would he entreat him not to go on as hecommenced. Of you, the other tribunes, says Fabius, we request, thatyou will first of all consider that that power was provided for the aidof individuals, not for the ruin of the community: that you were createdtribunes of the commons, not enemies of the patricians. To us it isdistressing, to you a source of odium, that the republic, now bereft ofits chief magistrates, should be attacked; you will diminish not yourrights, but the odium against you. Confer with your colleague, that hemay postpone this business till the arrival of the consuls; even the®quans and the Volscians, when our consuls were carried off bypestilence last year, did not press on us with a cruel and tyrannicalwar."" The tribunes confer with Terentillus, and the bill being to allappearance deferred, but in reality abandoned, the consuls wereimmediately sent for."Book 3,Chapter 10,"Lucretius returned with immense spoil, and much greater glory; andthis glory he increased on his arrival, by exposing all the booty in theCampus Martius, so that each person might, during three days, recognisehis own and carry it away; the remainder was sold, for which no ownersappeared. A triumph was by universal consent due to the consul: but thematter was deferred, the tribune still pressing his law; this to theconsul seemed of greater importance. The business was discussed forseveral days, both in the senate and before the people: at length thetribune yielded to the majesty of the consul, and desisted; then the duehonour was rendered to the general and his army. He triumphed over theVolscians and ®quans: his troops followed him in his triumph. The otherconsul was allowed to enter the city in ovation without his soldiers. Onthe following year the Terentillian law having been taken up by theentire college, assailed the new consuls; the consuls were PubliusVolumnius and Servius Sulpicius. On that year the sky seemed to be onfire; a violent earthquake also occurred; it was now believed that an oxspoke, which circumstance had not obtained credit on the year before;among other prodigies it rained flesh also;[115] which shower a greatnumber of birds is reported to have carried off by flying so as tointercept it; that which did fall, is said to have lain scattered aboutfor several days, so that its smell evinced no change. The books[116]were consulted by the duumviri for sacred rites: dangers of attacksbeing made on the highest parts of the city, and of bloodshed thenceresulting, were predicted as about to come from an assemblage ofstrangers; among other things, an admonition was given that allintestine disturbances should be abandoned. The tribunes alleged thatthat was done to obstruct the law, and a desperate contest was at hand.Lo! (that the same circle of events may revolve every year) theHernicians bring word that the Volscians and the ®quans, though theirstrength was much impaired, were recruiting their armies: that theirchief dependence was Antium; that the inhabitants of Antium openly heldcouncils at Ecetra: that that was the source--there the strength--forthe war. As soon as this announcement was made in the senate, a levy wasordered: the consuls were commanded to divide the management of the warbetween them; that the Volscians should be the province of the one, the®quans that of the other. The tribunes cried out to their faces in theforum, ""That the Volscian war was all a concerted farce: that theHernicians were instructed to act their parts; that the liberty of theRoman people was now no longer crushed by manly efforts, but that it wasbaffled by cunning; because all probability was now gone that theVolscians, who were almost exterminated, and the ®quans, would ofthemselves commence hostilities, new enemies were sought for: that aloyal colony, and one in their very vicinity, was being renderedinfamous: that war was proclaimed against the unoffending people ofAntium, and in reality waged with the commons of Rome, which afterloading them with arms they were determined to drive out of the citywith precipitous haste, wreaking their vengeance on the tribunes, by theexile and expulsion of their fellow-citizens. That by these means, andlet them not think that there was any other object contemplated, the lawwas defeated; unless, whilst the matter was still in abeyance, whilstthey were still at home and in the garb of citizens, they would takeprecaution that they may not be driven out of possession of the city,and be subjected to the yoke. If they only had spirit, that supportwould not be wanting; that all the tribunes were unanimous; that therewas no apprehension from abroad, no danger. That the gods had takencare, on the preceding year, that their liberty could now be defendedwith safety."" Thus far the tribunes."Book 3,Chapter 11,"But, on the other side, the consuls, having placed their chairswithin view of them, were proceeding with the levy; thither the tribuneshasten, and draw the assembly along with them; a few were cited, by wayof making an experiment, and instantly violence commenced. Whomsoeverthe lictor laid hold of by order of the consul, him the tribune orderedto be discharged; nor did his own proper jurisdiction set a limit toeach, but whatever you set your mind upon, was to be attained by thehope of strength and by force. Just as the tribunes had behaved inimpeding the levy, in the same manner did the consuls conduct themselvesin obstructing the law which was brought on every assembly day. Thecommencement of the riot was, when the tribunes ordered the people toproceed to the vote, because the patricians refused to withdraw. Theelder citizens scarcely attended the contest, inasmuch as it was onelikely not to be directed by prudence, but abandoned to temerity anddaring. The consuls also generally kept out of the way, lest in thegeneral confusion they should expose their dignity to any insult. Therewas a young man, C¾so Quintius, a daring youth, as well by the nobilityof his descent, as by his personal size and strength; to thoseendowments granted by the gods he himself had added many militaryhonours, and eloquence in the forum; so that no person in the state wasconsidered more efficient either in speaking or in acting. When thisperson took his place in the centre of a body of the patricians,conspicuous above the rest, carrying as it were in his eloquence andbodily strength dictatorships and consulships combined, he alonewithstood the storms of the tribunes and the populace. Under hisguidance the tribunes were frequently driven from the forum, the commonsrouted and dispersed; such as came in his way, went off after beingill-treated and stripped; so that it became sufficiently evident, that,if he were allowed to proceed in this way, the law would be defeated.Then the other tribunes being now almost thrown into despair, AulusVirginius, one of the college, institutes a criminal prosecution on acapital charge against C¾so. By this proceeding he rather irritated thanintimidated his violent temper: so much the more vigorously did heoppose the law, annoyed the commons, and persecuted the tribunes, as itwere by a regular war. The prosecutor suffered the accused to rush onheadlong, and to heighten the charges against him by the flame andmaterial of the popular odium thus incurred: in the mean time heproceeded with the law, not so much in the hope of carrying it through,as to provoke the temerity of C¾so. There many inconsiderate expressionsand actions passing among the young men, are charged on the temper ofC¾so, through the prejudice raised against him; still the law wasresisted. And Aulus Virginius frequently remarks to the people, ""Are youeven now sensible that you cannot have C¾so, as a fellow-citizen, withthe law which you desire? Though why do I say law? he is an opponent ofyour liberty; he surpasses all the Tarquins in arrogance. Wait till heis made consul or dictator, whom, though but a private citizen, you nowsee exercising kingly sway over you by his strength and audacity."" Manyassented, complaining that they had been beaten by him: and stronglyurged on the tribune to go through with the prosecution."Book 3,Chapter 12,"The day of trial now approached, and it was evident that persons ingeneral considered that their liberty depended on the condemnation ofC¾so: then, at length being forced to it, he addressed the commonsindividually, though with a strong feeling of indignation; his relativesfollowed him, the principal members of the state. Titus QuintiusCapitolinus, who had been thrice consul, after he recounted manysplendid achievements of his own, and of his family, stated, thatneither in the Quintian family, nor in the Roman state, had thereappeared such promising genius of such early valour. ""That he had firstbeen his soldier, that he had often in his sight fought against theenemy."" Spurius Furius declared, that ""he having been sent to him byQuintius Capitolinus, had come to his aid when in the midst of danger;that there was no individual by whose exertions he considered the commonweal more effectually re-established."" Lucius Lucretius, the consul ofthe preceding year, in the full splendour of recent glory, shared hisown services with C¾so; he recounted his battles, detailed hisdistinguished exploits, both on expeditions and in the field; he advisedand recommended that they would prefer this extraordinary young man,endowed with all the advantages of nature and of rank, and (one whowould prove) of the utmost importance to the interest of that state intowhich he should come, to be their fellow-citizen, rather than thecitizen of a foreign state. ""That with respect to that which may beoffensive in him, heat and vehemence, time would diminish daily; thatthe prudence, which may be wanting in him, was increasing daily; that ashis faults were declining and his virtues ripening to maturity, theyshould allow so distinguished a man to become old in their state."" Amongthese his father, Lucius Quintius, who bore the surname of Cincinnatus,without dwelling on his merits, lest he should heighten public hatred,but soliciting pardon for his errors and his youth, implored of them toforgive his son for his sake, who had not given offence to any one byeither word or deed. But some, through respect or fear, turned away fromlistening to his entreaties; others complaining that themselves andtheir friends had been ill-treated, by the harshness of their answerdeclared their sentence beforehand."Book 3,Chapter 13,"Independently of the general odium, one charge bore heavily on theaccused; that Marcus Volscius Fictor, who some years before had beentribune of the people, had come forward as a witness: ""that not longafter the pestilence had been in the city, he had fallen in with a partyof young men rioting in the Suburra; that a scuffle arose there; andthat his elder brother, not yet perfectly recovered from his illness,had fallen down almost dead, being struck with the fist by C¾so; that hewas carried home between the hands of some persons, and that heconsidered that he died from that blow; and that it had not beenpermitted to him by the consuls of former years to follow up thematter."" In consequence of Volscius vociferating these charges, thepeople became so excited, that C¾so was near being killed through theviolence of the people. Virginius orders him to be seized and carried toprison. The patricians oppose force to force. Titus Quintius exclaims,""that a person for whom a day of trial for a capital offence has beenappointed, and whose trial was now at hand, ought not to be outragedbefore trial and without sentence being passed."" The tribune says, ""thathe would not inflict punishment[117] on him before condemnation, that hewould however keep him in prison until the day of trial; that the Romanpeople may have an opportunity of inflicting punishment on one who hadkilled a man."" The tribunes being appealed to, secure their prerogativeby adopting a middle course;[118] they forbid his being thrown intoconfinement, and declare it to be their wish that the accused shouldappear on his trial, and that a sum of money should be promised to thepeople, in case he should not appear. How large a sum of money ought tobe promised, came under discussion: that is referred to the senate. Theaccused was detained in the public assembly, until the patricians shouldbe consulted: it was determined that he should give bail:[119] each bailthey bound to the amount of three thousand _asses_; how many should begiven, was left to the tribunes; they limited the number to ten; for tensureties the prosecutor discharged the accused. He was the first whogave public sureties. Being discharged from the forum, he went thefollowing night into exile among the Etrurians. When on the day of trialit was pleaded that he had quitted his home in order to go into exile,Virginius notwithstanding holding the comitia, his colleagues whenappealed to dismissed the assembly: the fine was rigorously exacted[120]from the father; so that after selling all his effects, he lived for aconsiderable time in a solitary cottage on the other side of the Tiber,as if in exile. This trial and the proposing of the law gave fullemployment to the state: there was quiet from foreign arms."Book 3,Chapter 14,"When the tribunes, flushed as it were with victory, imagined thatthe law was in a manner passed, the patricians being now dismayed by thebanishment of C¾so, and when, with respect to the seniors of thepatricians, they had relinquished all share in the administration of thecommonwealth; the juniors, more especially those who were the intimatefriends of C¾so, redoubled their resentful feelings against thecommons, and suffered not their spirits to droop; but the greatestimprovement was made in this particular, that they tempered theiranimosity by a certain degree of moderation. When for the first timeafter C¾so's banishment the law began to be brought forward, arrayed andwell prepared with a numerous body of clients, they attacked thetribunes, on their affording a pretext for it by attempting to removethem, in such a manner, that no one individual carried home from thenceany prominent share either of glory or ill-will; the people complainedthat for one C¾so a thousand had started up. During the intermediatedays, when the tribunes made no stir regarding the law, nothing could bemore mild or peaceable than those same persons; they saluted theplebeians courteously, entered into conversation, and invited them home;they attended the forum, and suffered the tribunes themselves to holdtheir meetings without interruption: they never were uncivil to any oneeither in public or in private, unless when the business respecting thelaw began to be agitated. On other occasions the young men were popular.And not only did the tribunes transact all their other affairs withoutdisturbance, but they were even re-elected for the following year,without one offensive expression, much less any violence being employed.By soothing and managing the commons they gradually rendered themtractable. By these methods the law was evaded for the entire year."Book 3,Chapter 15,"The consuls Caius Claudius, the son of Appius, and Publius ValeriusPublicola, found the state in a more tranquil condition. The new yearhad brought with it nothing new; the thoughts about carrying the law, orsubmitting to it, engrossed all the members of the state. The more theyounger members of the senate endeavoured to insinuate themselves intofavour with the commons, the more strenuously did the tribunes strive tothwart them, so that they rendered them suspicious in the eyes of thecommons by alleging: ""that a conspiracy was formed; that C¾so was inRome; that plans were concerted for assassinating the tribunes, andbutchering the commons. That the commission assigned by the eldermembers of the patricians was, that the young men should abolish thetribunitian power from the state, and the form of government should bethe same as it had been before the sacred mount had been takenpossession of."" Both a war from the Volsci and ®qui, which was now astated thing, and one that was a regular occurrence for almost everyyear, was apprehended, and another evil nearer home started upunexpectedly. The exiles and slaves to the number of four thousand andfive hundred men took possession of the Capitol and citadel during thenight, under the command of Appius Herdonius, a Sabine. Immediately amassacre took place in the citadel of those who had evinced anunwillingness to enter into the conspiracy and to take up arms. Some,during the alarm, run down to the forum, driven precipitately throughthe panic; the cries, ""to arms,"" and ""the enemy are in the city,"" wereheard alternately. The consuls were both afraid to arm the commons, andto suffer them to remain unarmed; uncertain what sudden calamity hadassailed the city, whether external or intestine, whether from thehatred of the commons or the treachery of the slaves: they were forquieting the tumults, by such endeavours they sometimes exasperatedthem; for the populace, panic-stricken and terrified, could not bedirected by authority. They give out arms, however, notindiscriminately; only so that, the enemy being still uncertain,[121]there might be a protection sufficient to be relied on for allemergencies. The remainder of the night they passed in posting guardsthrough proper places through the entire city, anxious and uncertain, asto who the persons might be, and how great the number of the enemy was.Day-light then disclosed the war and the leader of the war. AppiusHerdonius summoned the slaves to liberty from the Capitol: ""that he hadespoused the cause of every most unfortunate individual, in order tobring back to their country those driven out by oppression, and toremove the grievous yoke from the slaves. That he had rather that weredone under the authority of the Roman people. If there be no hope inthat quarter, that he would rouse the Volscians and ®qui, and would tryall extremities."""Book 3,Chapter 16,"The matter began to disclose itself more clearly to the patriciansand the consuls; besides those things, however, which were openlydeclared, they dreaded lest this might be a scheme of the Veientes orSabines; and, as there were so many of the enemy in the city, lest theSabine and Etrurian troops might come on according to a concerted plan;and then lest their eternal enemies, the Volscians and ®qui, shouldcome, not to ravage their territories, as before, but to their verycity, already in part taken. Many and various were their fears; amongothers, the most prominent was their dread of the slaves, lest eachmight harbour an enemy in his own house, one whom it was neithersufficiently safe to trust, nor to deny[122] confidence to him lest, bynot trusting him, he might become more incensed. And (the evil) seemedscarcely capable of being resisted by perfect harmony (between thedifferent orders of the state); only no one apprehended the tribunes orcommons, other evils predominating and constantly starting up; thatappeared an evil of a mild nature, and one always arising during thecessation of other evils, and it then appeared to be lulled to rest byexternal terror. Yet that was almost the only one that most aggravatedtheir distressing circumstances: for such madness took possession of thetribunes, that they contended that not war, but the empty appearance ofwar had taken possession of the Capitol, to avert the people's mindsfrom attending to the law; that these friends and clients of thepatricians would depart in greater silence than they came, if they onceperceived that, by the law being passed, they had raised these tumultsin vain. They then held a meeting for passing the law, having calledaway the people from their arms. In the mean time, the consuls convenethe senate, another dread presenting itself on the part of the tribunes,greater than that which the nightly foe had occasioned."Book 3,Chapter 17,"When it was announced that their arms were being laid aside, andthat the men were quitting their posts, Publius Valerius, his colleaguestill detaining the senate, hastens from the senate-house; he comesthence into the meeting to the tribunes: ""What is all this,"" says he,""tribunes? Are you determined to overthrow the commonwealth under theguidance and auspices of Appius Herdonius? Has he been so successful incorrupting you, who, by his authority, has not influenced your slaves?When the enemies are over our heads, is it your pleasure that armsshould be given up, and laws be proposed?"" Then directing his discourseto the populace: ""If, Romans, no concern for your city, for yourselves,moves you, at least revere the gods of your country, now made captive bythe enemy. Jupiter, the best and greatest, Queen Juno, and Minerva, theother gods and goddesses, are besieged; the camp of slaves now holds thetutelary gods of the state. Does this seem to you the form of a state inits senses? Such a crowd of enemies is not only within the walls, but inthe citadel, commanding the forum and senate-house: in the mean whilemeetings are being held in the forum; the senate is in the senate-house,just as when perfect tranquillity prevails; the senator gives hisopinion, the other Romans give their votes. Would it not behove all thepatricians and commons, consuls, tribunes, citizens, and all classes ofpersons, to bring aid with arms in their hands, to run into the Capitol,to liberate and restore to peace that most august residence of Jupiter,the best and greatest? O Father Romulus! do thou infuse into thy progenythat determination of thine, by which you once recovered from these sameSabines the citadel, when obtained by gold. Order them to pursue thissame path, which thou, as leader, and thy army, pursued. Lo! I, asconsul, shall be the first to follow thee and thy footsteps, as far as amortal can follow a god."" The close of his speech was: ""That he wouldtake up arms, that he invited every citizen of Rome to arms; if any oneshould oppose, that he, [123]forgetful of the consular authority, thetribunitian power, and the devoting laws, would consider him as anenemy, whoever he may, wheresoever he may, in the Capitol, or in theforum. That the tribunes might order arms to be taken up against PubliusValerius the consul, since they forbid it against Appius Herdonius; thathe would venture to act in that manner in the case of the tribunes, inwhich the founder of his family had ventured to act in the case ofkings."" It now became apparent that extreme violence was about to takeplace, and that a disturbance among the Romans would be exhibited as asight to the enemy; the law, however, could neither be prepared, norcould the consul proceed to the Capitol: night quashed the contest thathad commenced; the tribunes yielded to the night, dreading the arms ofthe consuls. The fomenters of the disturbances being removed fromthence, the patricians went about among the commons, and introducingthemselves into their circles of conversation, they introducedobservations suited to the occasion: they advised them ""to beware intowhat hazard they were bringing the commonwealth; that the contest wasnot between the patricians and commons, but that patricians and commonstogether, the fortress of the city, the temples of the gods, theguardian gods of the state and of private families, were being deliveredup to the enemy."" Whilst these affairs are going on in the forum for thepurpose of appeasing the disturbances, the consuls in the mean time hadarmed the several gates and the walls, lest the Sabines or the Veientianenemy should make any move."Book 3,Chapter 18,"On the same night, messengers come to Tusculum announcing that thecitadel was taken, and the Capitol seized, and the other state ofdisturbance in the city. Lucius Mamilius was at that time dictator atTusculum; he, having immediately convoked the senate and introduced themessengers, earnestly advises: ""That they should not wait untilambassadors came from Rome, suing for assistance; that the very dangerand risk, and the social gods, and the faith of treaties, demanded it;that the gods would never afford them an equal opportunity of obligingso powerful a state and so near a neighbour."" It is determined thatassistance should be sent: the young men are enrolled; arms are given tothem. Coming to Rome at break of day, they at a distance exhibited theappearance of enemies. The ®qui or Volscians appeared to be coming. Thenwhen the groundless alarm was removed, they are admitted into the city,and descend in a body into the forum. There Publius Valerius, havingleft his colleague to guard the gates, was now drawing up in order ofbattle. The great influence of the man had produced an effect, when heaffirmed that, ""the Capitol being recovered, and the city restored topeace, if they would allow themselves to be convinced what lurking fraudwas concealed under the law proposed by the tribunes, that he wouldoffer no obstruction to the meeting of the people, mindful of hisancestors, mindful of his surname, and that the province of protectingthe people had been handed down to him as hereditary by his ancestors.""Following him as their leader, notwithstanding the tribunes cried outagainst it, they direct their march up the Capitoline hill. The Tusculantroops also joined them. Allies and citizens vied with each other whichof them should appropriate to themselves the honour of recovering thecitadel. Each leader encourages his own men. Then the enemy becameterrified, and placed no dependence on any but the place. The Romans andallies advance on them whilst in this state of alarm. They had nowbroken into the porch of the temple, when Publius Valerius is slainanimating the fight at the head of his men. Publius Volumnius, a man ofconsular rank, saw him falling. Having directed his men to cover thebody, he rushes forward to the place and office of consul. Through theirardour and impetuosity the perception of so heavy a blow did not reachthe soldiers; they conquered before they perceived that they conqueredwithout a leader. Many of the exiles defiled the temple with theirblood; many were taken alive; Herdonius was slain. Thus the Capitol wasrecovered. With respect to the prisoners,[124] punishment was inflictedon each according to his station, whether he was a freeman or a slave.The commons are stated to have thrown farthings into the consul's house,that he might be buried with greater solemnity."Book 3,Chapter 19,"Peace being established, the tribunes then pressed on the patriciansto fulfil the promise of Publius Valerius; they pressed on Claudius, tofree the shade of his colleague from breach of faith, and to allow thebusiness of the law to proceed. The consul asserted that he would sufferthe discussion on the law to go on, till he had a colleague appointed inthe room of the deceased. These disputes held on until the elections forsubstituting a consul. In the month of December,[125] by the mostzealous exertions of the patricians, Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus, C¾so'sfather, is elected consul to enter on his office without delay. Thecommons were dismayed at their being about to have as consul a manincensed against them, powerful by the support of the patricians, by hisown merit, and by three sons, not one of whom yielded to C¾so ingreatness of spirit; ""whilst they were superior to him by theirexercising prudence and moderation, when the occasion required."" When heentered on his office, in his frequent harangues from the tribunal, hewas not more vehement in restraining the commons than in reproving thesenate, ""by the listlessness of which body the tribunes of the commons,now become perpetual, by means of their tongues and prosecutionsexercised regal authority, not as in a republic of the Roman people, butas if in an ill-regulated family. That with his son C¾so, fortitude,constancy, all the splendid qualifications of youth in war or in peace,had been driven and exiled from the city of Rome: that talkative andturbulent men, sowers of discord, twice and even thrice re-electedtribunes, lived in the most destructive practices with regal tyranny.Did that Aulus Virginius,"" says he, ""deserve less punishment than AppiusHerdonius, because he was not in the Capitol? considerably more, byJove, (in the mind of any one) who would judge the matter fairly.Herdonius, if nothing else, by avowing himself an enemy, in a mannergave you notice to take up arms: this man, by denying the existence ofwar, took arms out of your hands, and exposed you defenceless to yourslaves and exiles. And did you, (without any offence to Caius Claudiusand to Publius Valerius, now no more let me say it,) did you advanceagainst the Capitoline hill before you expelled those enemies from theforum. It is shameful before gods and men. When the enemy were in thecitadel, in the very Capitol, when the leader of the exiles and slaves,after profaning every thing, took up his residence in the shrine ofJupiter, the best and greatest, arms were taken up in Tusculum soonerthan in Rome. It was a matter of doubt whether Lucius Mamilius, theTusculan leader, or Publius Valerius and Caius Claudius, the consuls,recovered the Roman citadel, and we, who formerly did not suffer theLatins to touch arms, even in their own defence, when they had the enemyin their very frontiers, should have been taken and destroyed now, hadnot the Latins taken up arms of their own accord. Tribunes, is thisbringing aid to the commons, to expose them in a defenceless state to bebutchered by the enemy. Now, if any one, even the humblest individual ofyour commons, (which portion you have as it were broken off from therest of the state, and made it your country and peculiar commonwealth,)if any one of these persons were to bring word that his house was besetby an armed band of slaves, you would think that assistance should beafforded to him. Was Jupiter, the best and greatest, when surrounded bythe arms of exiles and of slaves, deserving of no human aid? And dothese persons require that they be considered sacred andinviolable,[126] with whom the gods themselves are neither sacred norinviolable? But, steeped as ye are in crimes against both gods and men,do ye say that you will pass your law this year? Verily then the day onwhich I was created consul was a disastrous day for the commonwealth,much more so even than that on which Publius Valerius the consul fell,if ye should carry it. Now, first of all,"" says he, ""Romans, it is theintention of myself and of my colleague to march the legions against theVolsci and the ®qui. I know not by what fatality we find the gods morepropitious when we are at war than in peace. How great the danger fromthose states would have been, had they known that the Capitol wasbesieged by exiles, it is better to conjecture from the past, than tofeel from actual experience."""Book 3,Chapter 20,"The consul's harangue had a great effect on the commons; thepatricians, recovering their spirits, considered the state asre-established. The other consul, more eager as a seconder than as thefirst mover (of a measure), readily suffering his colleague to take thefirst lead in a matter of so much importance, claimed to himself hisshare of the consular duty in executing the plan. Then the tribunes,mocking these declarations as empty, went on inquiring ""by what meansthe consuls would lead out the army, as no one would allow them to holda levy?"" ""But,"" says Quintius, ""we have no occasion for a levy; since atthe time Publius Valerius gave arms to the commons to recover theCapitol, they all took an oath to him, that they would assemble on anorder from the consul, and would not depart without an order. Wetherefore publish our order that all of you, who have sworn, attendto-morrow under arms at the lake Regillus."" The tribunes then began tocavil, and wished to absolve the people from their obligation; thatQuintius was a private person at the time at which they were bound bythe oath. But that disregard of the gods which prevails in the presentage had not yet arrived; nor did every one, by his own interpretation,accommodate oaths and laws to his own purposes, but rather adapted hisconduct to them. Wherefore the tribunes, as there was no hope ofobstructing the matter, attempted to delay the departure (of the army)the more earnestly on this account, because a report had gone out ""boththat the augurs had been ordered to attend at the lake Regillus, and toconsecrate a place, where business might be transacted with the peoplewith the benefit of auspices; that whatever had been passed at Rome bytribunitian violence, might be repealed there in an assembly. That allwould agree to that which the consuls wished; for that there was noappeal at a distance greater than that of a mile from the city: and thatthe tribunes, if they should come there, would, among the rest of thecrowd, be subjected to the consular authority."" These matters alarmedthem; but the greatest terror which acted on their minds was, thatQuintius frequently said, ""that he would not hold an election ofconsuls. That the state was affected with such a disease, as could notbe stopped by the ordinary remedies. That the commonwealth required adictator, so that whoever should stir a step to disturb the peace of thestate, might feel that the dictatorship was without appeal."""Book 3,Chapter 21,"The senate was assembled in the Capitol. Thither the tribunes comewith the commons in great consternation: the populace, with loudclamours, implore the protection now of the consuls, now of thepatricians: nor could they make the consul recede from hisdetermination, until the tribunes promised that they would be under thedirection of the patricians. Then on the consul's laying before them thedemands of the tribunes and commons, decrees of the senate are passed,""That neither the tribunes should propose the law during that year, andthat the consuls should not lead the army from the city--that for thetime to come, the senate decided that it was to the injury of thecommonwealth, that the same magistrates should be continued, and thesame tribunes be re-appointed."" The consuls conformed to the authorityof the senate, the tribunes were re-appointed notwithstanding theremonstrances of the consuls. The patricians also, that they might notyield to the commons in any particular, re-elected Lucius Quintiusconsul. No proceeding of the consul was urged with more warmth duringthe entire year. ""Can I be surprised,"" says he, ""if your authority is oflittle weight, conscript fathers? yourselves are disparaging it.Forsooth, because the commons have violated a decree of the senate, byre-appointing their magistrates, you yourselves also wish it to beviolated, lest ye should yield to the populace in rashness; as if topossess greater power in the state consisted in having more ofinconstancy and irregularity; for it is certainly more inconstant andgreater folly, to do away with one's own decrees and resolutions, thanthose of others. Imitate, conscript fathers, the inconsideratemultitude; and ye, who should be an example to others, transgress by theexample of others, rather than others should act correctly by yours,provided I imitate not the tribunes, nor suffer myself to be re-electedconsul, contrary to a decree of the senate. But I advise you, CaiusClaudius, that both you on your part restrain the Roman people from thislicentiousness, and that you be persuaded of this on my part, that Ishall so take it, as not to consider that my honour has been obstructedby you, but that the glory of declining the honour has been augmented,and the odium, which would hang over me from its being continued, hasbeen lessened."" Upon this they issue this order jointly: ""That no oneshould attempt to make Lucius Quintius consul: if any one should do so,that they would not allow that vote."""Book 3,Chapter 22,"The consuls elected were Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, a third time, andLucius Cornelius Maluginensis. The census was performed that year; itwas a matter of religious scruple that the lustrum should be closed, onaccount of the Capitol having been taken and the consul slain. In theconsulate of Quintus Fabius and Lucius Cornelius, disturbances broke outimmediately at the commencement of the year. The tribunes were urging onthe commons. The Latins and Hernici brought word that a formidable warwas in preparation on the part of the Volscians and ®qui; that thetroops of the Volscians were now at Antium. Great apprehension was alsoentertained, that the colony itself would revolt: and with difficultywere the tribunes prevailed on to allow the war to take precedence. Theconsuls then divided the provinces between them. It was assigned toFabius to march the legions to Antium; to Cornelius, to protect thecity; lest any part of the enemy, as was the practice of the ®qui,should come to commit depredations. The Hernici and Latins were orderedto supply soldiers in conformity to the treaty; and in the army twoparts consisted of allies, one part of natives. When the allies came tothe day already appointed, the consul pitches his camp outside theCapuan gate. Then, after the army was purified, he set out for Antium,and encamped not far from the town, and standing camp of the enemy.Where, when the Volscians, not venturing to risk an engagement, werepreparing to protect themselves quietly within their ramparts, on thefollowing day Fabius drew up not one mixed army of allies and citizens,but three separate bodies of the three states around the enemy's works.He himself was in the centre with the Roman legions. He ordered them towatch for the signal from thence, so that the allies might both commencethe action together, and retire together, if he should sound a retreat.He placed their cavalry in the rear of each division. Having thusassailed the camp in three different points, he surrounds it; and whenhe pressed on from every side, he dislodges from the rampart theVolscians, not able to sustain his attack. Having then crossed thefortifications, he expels from the camp the crowd who were dismayed andinclining towards one direction. Upon this the cavalry, who could noteasily pass over the rampart, having stood by up to that period merespectators of the fight, having come up with them whilst flying indisorder on the open plain, enjoys a share of the victory, by cuttingdown the affrighted troops. The slaughter of them as they fled wasgreat, both in the camp and outside the lines; but the booty was stillgreater, because the enemy were scarcely able to carry off their armswith them; and their entire army would have been destroyed, had not thewoods covered them in their flight."Book 3,Chapter 23,"Whilst these transactions are taking place at Antium, the ®qui, inthe mean while, sending forward the main strength of their youth,surprise the citadel of Tusculum by night, and with the rest of theirarmy they sit down at no great distance from the walls of Tusculum, soas to divide the forces of the enemy. This account being quickly broughtto Rome, and from Rome to Antium, affect the Romans not less than if itwas told them that the Capitol was taken; so recent were both theservices of the Tusculans, and the very similitude of the danger seemedto require a return of the aid that had been afforded. Fabius, giving upevery other object, removes the booty hastily from the camp to Antium.Having a small garrison there, he hurries on his army by forced marchesto Tusculum. The soldiers were allowed to carry nothing but their arms,and whatever dressed provision was at hand. The consul Cornelius sendsprovisions from Rome. The war was carried on at Tusculum for severalmonths. With one part of his army the consul assailed the camp of the®qui; a part he had given to the Tusculans to recover their citadel.They never could have made their way to it by force. Famine at lengthwithdrew the enemy from it. And when they came to this at last, theywere all sent under the yoke by the Tusculans, unarmed and naked. These,when betaking themselves home by an ignominious flight, were overtakenby the Roman consul on Algidum and cut off to a man. After this victory,having marched back[127] his army to Columen, (that is the name of theplace,) he pitches his camp. The other consul also, as soon as the Romanwalls ceased to be in danger, the enemy being defeated, set out fromRome. Thus the consuls, having entered the territories of the enemies ontwo different sides, strenuously vie with each other in depopulating theVolscians on the one hand, the ®qui on the other. I find in some writersthat the people of Antium revolted[128] the same year. That LuciusCornelius, the consul, conducted that war and took the town, I would notventure to affirm for certain, because no mention is made of the matteramong the older writers."Book 3,Chapter 24,"This war being concluded, a tribunitian war at home alarms thesenate. They exclaim, ""that the detaining the army abroad was done for afraudulent motive: that such frustration was for the purpose of doingaway with the law; that they, however, would go through with the matterundertaken by them."" Publius Lucretius, however, the pr¾fect of thecity, so far prevailed that the proceedings of the tribunes werepostponed till the arrival of the consuls. A new cause of disturbancealso arose. Aulus Cornelius and Quintus Servilius, qu¾stors, appoint aday of trial for Marcus Volscius, because he had come forward as amanifestly false witness against C¾so. For it appeared by many proofs,that the brother of Volscius, from the time he first became ill, notonly never appeared in public, but that he had not even arisen from hissick bed, and that he died of an illness of several months' standing;and that at the time to which the witness had referred the commission ofthe crime, C¾so had not been seen at Rome: those who served in the armywith him, positively stating that at that time he had constantlyattended at his post with them without any leave of absence. Manypersons proposed on their own private responsibility to Volscius to havea judicial decision on the matter.[129] As he would not venture to go totrial, all these matters coinciding rendered the condemnation ofVolscius no less certain than that of C¾so had been on the testimony ofVolscius. The tribunes occasioned a delay, who said that they would notsuffer the qu¾stors to hold the assembly[130] concerning the accused,unless it was first held concerning the law. Thus both matters were spunout till the arrival of the consuls. When they entered the city intriumph with their victorious army, because silence was (observed) withregard to the law, many thought that the tribunes were struck withdismay. But they, (for it was now the close of the year,) desirous ofobtaining a fourth tribuneship, had turned away their efforts from thelaw to canvassing for the elections; and when the consuls strove with noless strenuousness than if the law in question were proposed for thepurpose of lessening their own dignity, the victory in the contest wason the side of the tribunes. On the same year peace was granted to the®qui on their suing for it. The census, a matter commenced on thepreceding year, is completed. The number of citizens rated were onehundred and seventeen thousand three hundred and nineteen. The consulsobtained great glory this year both at home and in war, because theyboth re-established peace abroad and at home; though the state was notin a state of absolute concord, yet it was less disturbed than at othertimes."Book 3,Chapter 25,"Lucius Minucius and Caius Nautius being next elected consuls, tookup the two causes which lay over since the preceding year. The consulsobstructed the law, the tribunes the trial of Volscius in the samemanner: but in the new qu¾stors there was greater power, and greaterinfluence. With Marcus Valerius, son of Valerius and grandson ofVolesus, Titus Quintius Capitolinus, who had been thrice consul, wasappointed qu¾stor. Since C¾so could neither be restored to the Quintianfamily, nor could he, though a most promising young man, be restored tothe state, he justly, and as in duty bound, prosecuted the false witnesswho had deprived an innocent person of the power of pleading his cause.When Virginius in particular and the (other) tribunes were promoting thepassing of the law, the space of two months was allowed to the consulsto examine into the law: so that, when they had satisfied the people, asto what secret designs were concealed under it, they should then allowthem to give their votes. The granting this respite establishedtranquillity in the city. The ®qui however did not allow them long rest;who, in violation of the treaty which had been made with the Romans theyear before, confer the chief command on Gracchus Cl¾lius. He was thenthe leading man amongst the ®qui. Under the command of Gracchus theycarry hostile depredations into the district of Lavici, from thence intothat of Tusculum, and laden with booty they pitch their camp at Algidum.To that camp Quintus Fabius, Publius Volumnius, Aulus Posthumius, cometo complain of the wrongs committed, and to demand restitution inaccordance with the treaty. The general of the ®qui commands them ""todeliver to the oak whatever instructions they brought from the Romansenate; that he in the mean time should attend to other matters."" Alarge oak tree hung over the pr¾torium, the shade of which constituted apleasant seat. Then one of the ambassadors, when departing, says, ""Letboth this consecrated oak and all the gods hear the treaty violated byyou, and favour both our complaints now, and our arms presently, when weshall simultaneously avenge the rights of gods and men as violated byyou."" As soon as the ambassadors returned to Rome, the senate orderedone of the consuls to lead his army against Gracchus at Algidum, to theother they assigned as his province the laying waste of the country ofthe ®qui. The tribunes, according to their practice, attempted toobstruct the levy; and probably would have eventually prevented it, buta new cause of alarm was suddenly added."Book 3,Chapter 26,"A large body of Sabines, committing dreadful devastation, approachedvery close to the walls of the city. The fields were laid waste, thecity was struck with terror. Then the commons cheerfully took up arms;two large armies were raised, the tribunes remonstrating to no purpose.Nautius led the one against the Sabines; and having pitched his camp atEretum, by small detachments, generally by nightly incursions, heeffected such desolation in the Sabine land, that, when compared to it,the Roman territories seemed intact by an enemy. Minucius had neitherthe same success nor the same energy of mind in conducting his business;for after he had pitched his camp at no great distance from the enemy,without having experienced any considerable loss, he kept himselfthrough fear within the camp. When the enemy perceived this, theirboldness increased, as sometimes happens, from others' fears; and havingattacked his camp by night, when open force did not succeed well, theyon the following day drew lines of circumvallation around it. Beforethese could close up all the passes, by a vallum being thrown up on allsides, five horsemen being despatched between the enemies' posts,brought the account to Rome, that the consul and his army were besieged.Nothing could have happened so unexpected, nor so unlooked-for.Accordingly the panic and the alarm was as great as if the enemybesieged the city, not the camp. They send for the consul Nautius; inwhom when there seemed to be but insufficient protection, and they weredetermined that a dictator should be appointed to retrieve theirembarrassed affairs, Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus is appointed byuniversal consent. It is worth those persons' while to listen, whodespise all things human in comparison with riches, and who suppose""that there is no room for exalted honour, nor for virtue, unless whereriches abound in great profusion."" Lucius Quintius, the sole hope of theRoman people, cultivated a farm of four acres, at the other side of theTiber, which are called the Quintian meadows, opposite to the very placewhere the dock-yard now is. There, whether leaning on a stake in a ditchwhich he was digging, or in the employment of ploughing, engaged atleast on some rural work, as is certain, after mutual salutations hadpassed, being requested by the ambassadors to put on his gown, andlisten to the commands of the senate, (with wishes) that it might behappy both to him and to the commonwealth, being astonished, and askingfrequently ""whether all was safe,"" he bids his wife Racilia immediatelyto bring his toga from his hut. As soon as he put this on and cameforward, after first wiping off the dust and sweat, the ambassadors,congratulating him, unite in saluting him as dictator: they call himinto the city; explain to him what terror now exists in the army. Avessel was prepared for Quintius by order of government, and his threesons having come out to meet him, receive him on his landing at theother side; then his other relatives and friends; then the greater partof the patricians. Accompanied by this numerous attendance, and thelictors going before him, he was conducted to his residence. There was anumerous concourse of the commons also; but they by no means looked onQuintius with equal pleasure, considering both the extent of hisauthority as too great, and the man vested with such authority ratherarbitrary. And during that night indeed nothing was done in the citybesides posting guards."Book 3,Chapter 27,"On the next day the dictator, after he had come into the forumbefore day-light, names a master of the horse, Lucius Tarquitius, a manof patrician family, but one who, though he had served his campaignsamong the foot by reason of his scanty means, was yet considered by manydegrees the first in military skill among the Roman youth. With hismaster of the horse he came into the assembly, proclaims a suspension ofcivil business, orders the shops to be closed throughout the city, andforbids any one to attend to any private affairs. Then he commands thatall, whoever were of the military age, should attend under arms, in theCampus Martius, before sun-set, with dressed provisions for five daysand twelve palisades, and he commanded that whose age was too faradvanced for military service, should dress their victuals for thesoldiers in their vicinity, whilst the latter were preparing arms, andprocuring the palisade. Accordingly, the young men run in differentdirections to procure the palisades; they took them wherever they werenearest to them; no one was prevented, and they all attended punctuallyaccording to the dictator's order. Then the troops being formed, notmore fitted for the march than for an engagement, should the occasionrequire it, the dictator himself marches at the head of the legions, themaster of the horse at the head of his cavalry. In both bodies therewere such exhortations as the juncture itself required; that ""theyshould quicken their pace; that there was need of expedition, that theymight reach the enemy by night; that the consul and the Romans werebesieged; that they had been shut up now three days: that it wasuncertain what each day or night might bring with it; that the issue ofthe most important affairs often depended on a moment of time."" They, toplease their leaders, exclaimed among themselves, ""Standard-bearer,hasten on; follow, soldier."" At midnight they reach Algidum: and, assoon as they perceived that they were near the enemy, they halted."Book 3,Chapter 28,"There the dictator, having rode about, and having observed, as faras could be ascertained by night, what the situation of the camp was,and what its form, commanded the tribunes of the soldiers to order thebaggage to be thrown into one place, and that the soldiers with theirarms and palisades should return to their ranks. What he commanded wasexecuted. Then, with the regularity which they had observed on themarch, he draws the entire army in a long column around the enemies'camp, and directs that, when the signal was given, they should all raisea shout; and that on the shout being raised, each man should throw up atrench before his post, and fix his palisade. The orders being issued,the signal followed: the soldiers perform what they were commanded; theshout resounds around the enemy: it then passes beyond the camp of theenemy, and reaches the consul's camp: it occasions panic in one place,great joy in another. The Romans, observing to each other withexultation, ""that this was the shout of their countrymen, and that aidwas at hand,"" from their watch-guards and out-posts intimidate the enemyon their part. The consul says, that there must be no delay: ""that bythat shout not only their arrival was intimated, but that proceedingswere already commenced by their friends; and that it would be a wonderif the enemies' camp were not attacked on the outside."" He thereforeorders his men to take up arms and follow him. The battle was commencedby the legions during the night: they give notice to the dictator by ashout, that on that side also the action was commenced. The ®quans werenow preparing to prevent the works from being brought around them,[131]when, the battle being commenced by the enemy from within, turning theirattention from those employed on the fortifications to those who werefighting on the inside, lest a sally should be made through the centreof their camp, they left the night to remain without interruption forthe finishing of the work; and they continued the fight with the consultill daylight. At the break of day they were now encompassed by thedictator's works, and were scarcely able to maintain the fight againstone army. Then their lines were attacked by Quintius's army, whoimmediately after completing their work returned to their arms. Here anew fight pressed on them: the former one had suffered no relaxation.Then the twofold peril pressing hard on them, turning from fighting toentreaties, they implored the dictator on the one hand, the consul onthe other, not to make the victory consist in their general slaughter,that they would suffer them to depart without arms. When they were bidby the consul to go to the dictator, he, incensed against them, addedignominy (to defeat). He orders Gracchus Cloelius, their general, andother leaders to be brought to him in chains, and that they shouldevacuate the town of Corbio; ""that he wanted not the blood of the®quans: that they were allowed to depart; but that the confession may beat length extorted, that their nation was defeated and subdued, thatthey should pass under the yoke."" The yoke is formed with three spears,two fixed in the ground, and one tied across between the upper ends ofthem. Under this yoke the dictator sent the ®quans."Book 3,Chapter 29,"The enemy's camp being taken, which was full of every thing, (for hehad sent them away naked,) he distributed all the booty among his ownsoldiers only: chiding the consul's army and the consul himself, hesays, ""Soldiers, ye shall do without any portion of the spoil taken fromthat enemy to which you were well nigh becoming a spoil: and you, LuciusMinutius, until you begin to assume the spirit of a consul, shallcommand these legions as lieutenant-general."" Minutius accordinglyresigns his office of consul, and remains with the army, as he had beencommanded. But so meekly obedient were the minds of men at that time toauthority combined with superior merit, that this army, mindful of thekindness (conferred) rather than of the slur (cast on them), both voteda golden crown of a pound weight to the dictator, and saluted him astheir patron when setting out. The senate at Rome, being convened byQuintus Fabius, pr¾fect of the city, ordered Quintius to enter the cityin triumph, in the order of march in which he was coming. The leaders ofthe enemy were led before his car: the military standards were carriedbefore him: his army followed laden with spoil. Tables with provisionsare said to have been laid out before the houses of all, and (thesoldiers) partaking of the entertainment, followed the car with thetriumphal hymn and the usual jests, after the manner of revellers. Onthat day the freedom of the state was granted to Lucius Mamilius ofTusculum, with universal approbation. The dictator would have laid downhis office, had not the assembly for the trial of Marcus Volscius, thefalse witness, detained him; the fear of the dictator prevented thetribunes from obstructing it. Volscius was condemned and went into exileto Lanuvium. Quintius laid down his dictatorship on the sixteenth day,having received it for six months. During those days the consul Nautiusengages the Sabines at Eretum with distinguished success. Besides thedevastation of their lands, this additional blow also befell theSabines. Fabius Quintus was sent to Algidum as successor to Minucius.Towards the end of the year the tribunes began to agitate the questionof the law; but because two armies were abroad, the patricians carriedthe point, that no business should be proposed to the people. Thecommons succeeded in electing the same tribunes for the fifth time.They report that wolves seen in the Capitol were driven away by dogs;that on account of that prodigy the Capitol was purified. Such were thetransactions in that year."Book 3,Chapter 30,"uls. At the commencement of this year, when there was peace abroad,the same tribunes and the same law occasioned disturbances at home; andparties would have proceeded further, (so highly were their passionsinflamed,) had not, as if for the very purpose, news been brought, thatby an attack of the ®quans the garrison at Corbio had been cut off. Theconsuls convene the senate; they are ordered to raise a hasty levy andto proceed to Algidum. Then the contest about the law being given up, anew dispute arose regarding the levy. And the consular authority[132]was about to be overpowered by tribunitian influence, when an additionalcause of alarm comes on them: that the Sabine army had made a descentinto the Roman lands to commit depredations; that from thence they wereadvancing to the city. This fear influenced the tribunes to allow thelevy to proceed, not without a stipulation, however, that since they hadbeen foiled for five years, and as that was but little protection to thecommons, ten tribunes of the people should henceforward be elected.Necessity wrung this from the patricians; this exception only they made,that they should not hereafter re-elect the same tribunes. The electionfor the tribunes was held immediately, lest that measure also, likeothers, might prove a delusion after the war. On the thirty-sixth yearafter the first tribunes, ten were elected, two from each class; andprovision was made that they should be elected in this manner for thefuture. The levy being then held, Minucius marched out against theSabines, and found no enemy. Horatius, after the ®quans, having put thegarrison at Corbio to the sword, had taken Ortona also, fights a battleat Algidum; he slays a great number; drives the enemy not only fromAlgidum, but from Corbio and Ortona also. Corbio he razed to the groundfor their having betrayed the garrison."Book 3,Chapter 31,"t prevailed at home and abroad. They laboured under a scarcity ofprovisions on account of the excessive rains. A law was proposedregarding the making Mount Aventine public property. The same tribunesof the people being re-elected on the following year, Titus Romilius andCaius Veturius being consuls, strongly recommended the law[133] in alltheir harangues, ""That they were ashamed of their number increased to nopurpose, if that question should lie for their two years in the samemanner as it had lain for the whole preceding five."" Whilst they weremost busily employed in these matters, an alarming account comes fromTusculum, that the ®quans were in the Tusculan territory. The recentservices of that state made them ashamed of delaying relief. Both theconsuls were sent with an army, and find the enemy in their usual postin Algidum. A battle was fought there; upwards of seven thousand of theenemy were slain; the rest were routed; immense booty was obtained. Thisthe consuls sold on account of the low state of the treasury; theproceeding was the cause of dissatisfaction to the army, and it alsoafforded to the tribunes materials for bringing a charge against theconsuls before the commons. Accordingly, as soon as they went out ofoffice, in the consulship of Spurius Tarpeius and Aulus Aterius, a daywas appointed for Romilius by Caius Claudius Cicero, tribune of thepeople; for Veturius, by Lucius Alienus, plebeian ¾dile. They were bothcondemned, to the great mortification of the patricians; Romilius to payten thousand _asses_; Veturius, fifteen thousand. Nor did thismisfortune of their predecessors render the new consuls more remiss.They said that they too might be condemned, and that the commons andtribunes could not carry the law. Then having thrown up the law, which,in its repeated publication, had now grown old, the tribunes adopted amilder mode of proceeding with the patricians. ""That they should atlength put an end to their disputes. If plebeian laws displeased them,at least they should suffer legislators (chosen) in common, both fromthe commons and from the patricians, who would propose measuresadvantageous to both parties, and such as might tend to theequalization of liberty."" This proposal the patricians did not reject.They said that ""no one should propose laws, except some of thepatricians."" When they agreed with respect to the laws, and differedonly with respect to the proposer; ambassadors were sent to Athens,Spurius Posthumius Albus, Aulus Manlius, Publius Sulpicius Camerinus;and they were ordered to copy out the celebrated laws of Solon, and tobecome acquainted with the institutions, customs, and laws of the otherstates of Greece."Book 3,Chapter 32,"The year was undisturbed by foreign wars; the following one wasstill more quiet, Publius Curiatius and Sextus Quintilius being consuls,the tribunes observing uninterrupted silence, which was occasioned inthe first place by their waiting for the ambassadors who had gone toAthens, and for the foreign laws; in the next place, two heavycalamities arose at the same time, famine and pestilence, (which proved)destructive to man, and equally so to cattle. The lands were leftdesolate; the city exhausted by a constant succession of deaths. Manyand illustrious families were in mourning. The Flamen Quirinalis,Servilius Cornelius, died; as also the augur, Caius Horatius Pulvillus;into whose place the augurs elected Caius Veturius, the more eagerly,because he had been condemned by the commons. The consul Quintiliusdied, and four tribunes of the people. The year was rendered amelancholy one by these manifold disasters; but from an enemy there wasperfect quiet. Then Caius Menenius and Publius Sestius Capitolinus wereelected consuls. Nor was there in that year any external war:disturbances arose at home. The ambassadors had now returned with theAthenian laws; the tribunes pressed the more urgently, that acommencement should at length be made of compiling the laws. It wasresolved that decemvirs should be elected without appeal, and that thereshould be no other magistrate during that year. There was, for aconsiderable time, a dispute whether plebeians should be admitted amongthem: at length the point was given up to the patricians, provided thatthe Icilian law regarding the Aventine and the other devoting laws werenot repealed."Book 3,Chapter 33,"In the three hundred and first year after Rome was built, the formof the government was a second time changed, the supreme power beingtransferred from consuls to decemvirs, as it had passed before fromkings to consuls. The change was less remarkable, because not of longduration; for the joyous commencement of that government became toolicentious. So much the sooner did the matter fall, and (the usage) wasrecurred to, that the name and authority of consuls was committed to twopersons. The decemvirs appointed were, Appius Claudius, Titus Genucius,Publius Sestius, Lucius Veturius, Caius Julius, Aulus Manlius, ServiusSulpicius, Publius Curiatius, Titus Romilius, Spurius Postumius. OnClaudius and Genucius, because they had been elected consuls for thatyear, the honour was conferred in compensation for the honour (of theconsulate); and on Sestius, one of the consuls of the former year,because he had proposed that matter to the senate against the will ofhis colleague. Next to these were considered the three ambassadors whohad gone to Athens; at the same time that the honour might serve as arecompence for so distant an embassy; at the same time they consideredthat persons acquainted with the foreign laws would be of use indigesting the new code of regulations. Other persons made up the number.They say that persons advanced in years were appointed by the lastsuffrages, in order that they might oppose with less warmth the opinionsof others. The direction of the entire government was rested in Appiusthrough the favour of the commons, and he had assumed a demeanour sonew, that from a severe and harsh reviler of the people, he becamesuddenly a protector of the commons, and a candidate for popular favour.They administered justice to the people one every tenth day. On that daythe twelve fasces attended the pr¾fect of justice; one beadle attendedeach of his nine colleagues, and in the singular harmony amongthemselves, which unanimity might sometimes prove prejudicial to privatepersons, the strictest equity was shown to others. It will suffice toadduce a proof of their moderation by instancing one matter. Though theyhad been appointed without (the privilege of) appeal, yet a dead bodyhaving been found buried in the house of Publius Sestius, a man ofpatrician rank, and this having been brought forward in an assembly, ina matter equally clear and atrocious, Caius Julius, a decemvir,appointed a day of trial for Sestius, and appeared before the people asprosecutor (in a matter) of which he was legally a judge; andrelinquished his right, so that he might add what had been taken fromthe power of the office to the liberty of the people."Book 3,Chapter 34,"Whilst the highest and lowest alike experienced from them thisprompt administration of justice, impartial, as if from an oracle, thentheir attention was devoted to the framing of laws; and the ten tablesbeing proposed amid the intense expectation of all, they summoned thepeople to an assembly: and ""what may prove favourable, advantageous, andhappy to the commonwealth themselves, and to their children, orderedthem to go and read the laws that were exhibited."" ""That they hadequalized the rights of all, both the highest and the lowest, as far ascould be devised by the abilities of ten men; that the understanding andcounsels of a greater number might prove more successful; that theyshould turn in their minds each particular within themselves, canvass itin conversation; and bring together under public discussion whatevermight seem an excess or deficiency under each particular. That the Romanpeople should have such laws, as the general consent might appear not somuch to have ratified when proposed, as to have proposed fromthemselves."" When they appeared sufficiently corrected according topublic opinion (as expressed) regarding each chapter of the laws as itwas published, the laws of the ten tables were passed at the assemblyvoting by centuries; which, even at the present time, amid this immenseheap of laws crowded one upon the other, still remain the source of allpublic and private jurisprudence. A rumour was then spread that twotables were wanting; on the addition of which a body, as it were, of thewhole Roman law might be completed. The expectation of this, as the dayof election approached, created a desire to appoint decemvirs again. Thecommons now, besides that they detested the name of consuls as much asthat of kings, required not even the tribunitian aid, as the decemvirsin turn submitted to appeal."Book 3,Chapter 35,"But when the assembly for electing decemvirs was proclaimed for thethird market-day, so strong a flame of ambition blazed forth, that thefirst men of the state began to canvass individuals, (through fear, Isuppose, lest the possession of such high authority might becomeaccessible to persons not sufficiently worthy, if the post were leftunoccupied by themselves,) suppliantly soliciting for an honour, whichhad been opposed by them with all their might, from that commons withwhom they had so often contended. Their dignity now lowered to the riskof a contest, at such an age, and after passing through such honours,stimulated the exertions of Appius Claudius. You would not know whetherto reckon him among the decemvirs or the candidates; he resembled moreclosely one canvassing for the office than one invested with it; heaspersed the nobility, extolled every most insignificant and humblecandidate; surrounded by the Duilii and Icilii who had been tribunes, hebustled about the forum, through their means he recommended himself tothe commons; until his colleagues even, who till then had been extremelydevoted to him, turned their eyes on him, wondering what he meant. Itwas evident to them, that there was no sincerity in it; ""that certainlysuch affability amid such pride would not be for nothing. That thisexcessive lowering of himself, and putting himself on a level withprivate citizens, was not so much the conduct to be expected from onehastening to go out of office, as of one seeking the means of continuingthat office."" Not daring openly to oppose his wishes, they set aboutbaffling his ardour by humouring it. They by common consent confer onhim, as being the youngest, the office of presiding at the elections.This was an artifice, that he might not appoint himself; which no oneever did, except the tribunes of the people, and that too with the veryworst precedent. He, however, declaring that with the favour of fortunehe would preside at the elections, seized on the (intended)obstacle[134] as a happy occasion; and having by a coalition foiled thetwo Quintii, Capitolinus and Cincinnatus, and his own uncle, CaiusClaudius, a man most stedfast in the interest of the nobility, and othercitizens of the same eminence, he appoints as decemvirs men by no meansequal in rank of life: himself in the first instance, which proceedinghonourable men disapproved so much the more, as no one had imagined thathe would have the daring to act so. With him were elected MarcusCornelius-Maluginensis, Marcus Sergius, Lucius Minutius, Quintus FabiusVibulanus, Quintus PÏtelius, Titus Antonius Merenda, C¾so Duilius,Spurius Oppius Cornicen, Manius Rabuleius."Book 3,Chapter 36,"This was the end of Appius's assumption of a character not his own.Henceforward he began to live according to his own natural disposition,and to mould to his own temper his new colleagues before they shouldenter on their office. They held daily meetings remote from witnesses:then, furnished with their schemes of tyranny,[136] which they digestedapart from others, no longer dissembling their arrogance, difficult ofaccess, morose to all who addressed them, they carried out the matter tothe ides of May. The ides of May were at that time the usual period forcommencing office. At the commencement then of their magistracy, theyrendered the first day of their office remarkable by making anexhibition of great terror. For when the preceding decemvirs hadobserved the rule, that only one should have the fasces, and that thisemblem of royalty should pass through all in rotation, to each in histurn, they all suddenly came forth with the twelve fasces. One hundredand twenty lictors filled the forum, and carried before them the axestied up with the fasces: and they explained that it was of noconsequence that the axe should be taken away, as they had beenappointed without the privilege of appeal.[137] There was the appearanceof ten kings, and terrors were multiplied not only in the humblestindividuals, but even in the principal men among the patricians, whothought that a pretext and commencement of bloodshed were sought for; sothat if any one should utter a word favourable to liberty, either in thesenate or in a meeting of the people, the rods and axes would beinstantly brought forward, even to intimidate the rest. For besides thatthere was no protection in the people, the right of appeal being doneaway with, they had also by mutual consent prohibited interference witheach other:[138] whereas the preceding decemvirs had allowed the pointsof law decided by themselves to be amended by appeal to a colleague, andhad referred to the people some points which might seem to come withintheir own jurisdiction. For a considerable time the terror seemedequalized among all ranks; gradually it began to turn entirely on thecommons. They spared the patricians; arbitrary and cruel treatment wasshown to the humbler classes: they were wholly respective of the person,not of the cause: as being persons with whom interest usurped the forceof justice. Their decisions they concerted at home, and pronounced inthe forum. If any person appealed to a colleague, he left the one towhom he had appealed in such a manner as to regret that he had notabided by the sentence of the former. An opinion also had gone abroadwithout an authority, that they had conspired in their tyranny not onlyfor the present time, but that a clandestine league had been struckamong them (accompanied) with an oath, that they would not hold thecomitia, and that by perpetuating the decemvirate they would retain thepower now in their possession."Book 3,Chapter 37,"The plebeians then began to watch narrowly the countenances of thepatricians, and (hoped) to catch the breeze of liberty from thatquarter, by apprehending slavery from which, they had brought therepublic into its present condition. The leading members of the senatedetested the decemvirs, detested the commons; they neither approved ofwhat was going on, and they considered that what befell the latter wasnot without their deserving it. They were unwilling to assist men who,by rushing too eagerly towards liberty, had fallen into slavery: theyeven heaped injuries on them, that, from their disgust at the presentstate of things, two consuls and the former mode of government may atlength become desirable. The greater part of the year was now passed,and two tables of laws had been added to the ten tables of the formeryear; and if these laws also were once passed in an assembly of thecenturies, there now remained no reason why the republic should requirethat form of government. They were anxiously waiting to see how soonthe assembly would be proclaimed for the election of consuls. Thecommons were only devising by what means they should re-establish thetribunitian power, that bulwark of their liberty, a thing now so longdiscontinued. When in the mean time no mention was made of theelections, and the decemvirs, who had at first exhibited themselves tothe people, surrounded by men of tribunitian rank, because that wasdeemed popular, now guarded themselves by collecting young patricians;troops of these beset the tribunals. These seized and drove about thecommons, and the effects of the commons; when success attended the morepowerful individual, as far as obtaining any thing he might covet.[139]And now they spared not even their backs. Some were beaten with rods;others had to submit to the axe; and lest such cruelty might go fornothing, a grant of his effects followed the punishment of the owner.Corrupted by such bribes, the young nobility not only made no oppositionto oppression, but openly avowed their preference of their owngratification to the general liberty."Book 3,Chapter 38,"The ides of May came. No new election of magistrates having takenplace, private persons came forth as decemvirs, without any abatementeither in their determination to enforce their authority,[140] or anydiminution in the emblems employed to make a parade of their station.This indeed seemed to be regal tyranny. Liberty is now deplored as lostfor ever; nor does any champion stand forth, or appear likely to do so.And not only they themselves sunk into despondence, but they began to belooked down upon by the neighbouring states; and they felt indignantthat dominion should exist where liberty was lost. The Sabines with anumerous body of men made an incursion on the Roman territory; andhaving committed extensive devastations, after they had driven withimpunity booty of men and cattle, they recalled their troops which hadbeen dispersed in different directions to Eretum, and pitch their campthere, grounding their hopes on the dissensions at Rome; (and trusting)that they would prove an obstruction to the levy. Not only the couriers,but the flight of the country people through the city, occasioned alarm.The decemvirs consult what should be done. Whilst they were thus leftdestitute between the hatred of the patricians and people, fortuneadded, moreover, another cause of alarm. The ®quans on the opposite sidepitch their camp at Algidum; and ambassadors from Tusculum, imploringrelief, bring accounts that the Tusculan land was ravaged by detachmentsfrom thence. The panic occasioned hereby urged the decemvirs to consultthe senate, two wars at the same time surrounding the city. They orderthe patricians to be summoned into the senate-house, well aware what astorm of resentment was ready to break upon them; that all would heap onthem the causes of the land laid waste, and of the dangers whichthreatened them; and that that would occasion an attempt to abolishtheir office, if they did not unite in resisting, and by enforcing theirauthority with severity on a few of an intractable spirit repress theefforts of others. When the voice was heard in the forum of the criersummoning the senators into the senate-house before the decemvirs; as amatter altogether new, because they had long since laid aside the customof consulting the senate, it attracted the attention of the people, whoexpressed their surprise: ""What could have happened, that after so longan interval they should revive a practice now discontinued. That theyhad reason to return thanks to the enemy and to war, that any thing wasdone that used to be done when their state was free."" They looked aroundfor a senator through all parts of the forum, and seldom recognised oneany where: they then directed their attention to the senate-house, andto the solitude around the decemvirs: whilst both they themselvesreferred the non-assembling of the patricians to their own universallydetested government, and the commons (would have it, that the cause ofthe non-assembling was) because, being but private citizens, they (thedecemvirs) had no right to convene the senate;[141] ""that a head wasnow formed of those who would demand back their liberty, if the commonswould but accompany the senate, and as the patricians, when summoned,did not attend the senate, so the commons also should refuse to enlist.""Such were the remarks of the commons. There was scarcely any of thepatricians in the forum, and but very few in the city. In disgust withthe state of affairs, they had retired into the country, and wereattending to their own affairs, renouncing all public concerns,considering that they themselves were aloof from ill-treatment inproportion as they should remove themselves from the meeting andconverse of their imperious masters. When those who had been summoneddid not assemble, apparitors were despatched to their houses, both tolevy the penalties,[142] and to ascertain whether they declinedattendance through design? They bring back word that the senate was inthe country. This was more pleasing to the decemvirs, than if theybrought word that they were present and refused obedience to theircommands. They command them all to be sent for, and proclaim a meetingof the senate for the following day; which congregated together in muchgreater numbers than they themselves had expected. By which proceedingthe commons considered that their liberty was betrayed by thepatricians, because the senate had obeyed those persons, as if they hada right to compel them, who had already gone out of office; and were butprivate individuals, were it not for the violence employed by them."Book 3,Chapter 39,"But they showed more obedience in coming into the senate thanservility in the sentiments expressed by them, as we have learned. Itis recorded that, after Appius's stating the subject of the meeting, andbefore the opinions were demanded in order, Lucius Valerius Potitusexcited a commotion, by demanding permission to express his sentimentsconcerning the state, and when the decemvirs were prohibiting him withthreats, declaring that he would present himself before the people. (Wehave also heard) that Marcus Horatius Barbatus entered the lists with noless boldness, calling them ""ten Tarquins,"" and reminding them, ""thatunder the leadership of the Valerii and Horatii[144] the kings had beenexpelled. Nor was it of the mere name that men were then tired, it beingthat by which it was usual to style Jupiter, and by which Romulus, thefounder of the city, and his successors were also styled; a name toowhich has been retained even in the ceremonies of religion, as a solemnone; that it was the tyranny and arrogance of a king they then detested,which if they were not to be tolerated in one who was both a kinghimself and the son of a king, who was to tolerate it in so many privatecitizens? that they should beware lest, by preventing persons fromspeaking their sentiments freely in the senate, they might oblige themto raise their voice outside the senate-house. Nor could he see how itwas less allowable for him, a private citizen, to summon the people toan assembly, than for them to convene the senate. They might try,whenever they pleased, how much more determined a sense of wrong will befound to be in vindicating one's own liberty, than ambition in(vindicating) usurped domination. That they proposed the questionconcerning the Sabine war, as if the Roman people had any more importantwar on hand, than that against those who, having been elected for thepurpose of framing laws, had left no law in the state; who had abolishedelections, annual magistrates, the regular change of rulers, which wasthe only means of equalizing liberty; who, though private citizens,still possess the fasces and regal dominion. That on the expulsion ofthe kings, patrician magistrates were appointed, and subsequently,after the secession of the people, plebeian magistrates. To which party,he asked, did they belong? To the popular party? What had they ever donewith the concurrence of the people? were they nobles? who for now nearlyan entire year have not held a meeting of the senate; and then hold onein such a manner, that they actually prevent numbers from expressingtheir sentiments regarding the commonwealth; that they should not placetoo much hope in the fears of others; that the grievances which they aresuffering now appear to men more oppressive than any they may have toapprehend."""Book 3,Chapter 40,"Whilst Horatius was exclaiming in this manner, ""and the decemvirscould not discover any limit either to their anger or forbearance, norcould they see to what the thing would come, Caius Claudius, who wasuncle to Appius the decemvir, delivered an address more like entreatiesthan reproach, beseeching him by the shade of his own brother and of hisfather, that he would hold in recollection the civil society in which hehad been born rather than the confederacy nefariously entered into withhis colleagues; that he besought this much more on Appius's own account,than for the sake of the commonwealth. For that the commonwealth wouldassert its rights in spite of them, if it could not obtain them withtheir consent. But that from great contests great animosities arise; theresult of the latter he dreads."" Though the decemvirs forbad them tospeak on any other subject than that which they had submitted to them,they felt too much respect for Claudius to interrupt him. He thereforeconcluded his address by moving that it was their wish that no decree ofthe senate should be passed. And all understood the matter thus, thatthey were judged by Claudius to be private citizens; and many of the menof consular standing expressed their assent. Another measure proposed,more harsh in appearance, possessed much less efficacy; one whichordered the patricians to assemble to elect an interrex; for by passingany resolution they judged, that those persons who convened the senatewere magistrates of some kind or other, whilst the person whorecommended that no decree of the senate should be passed, had therebydeclared them private citizens. When the cause of the decemvirs was nowsinking, Lucius Cornelius Maluginensis, brother of Marcus Cornelius thedecemvir, having been purposely reserved from among the consular men toclose the debate, by affecting an anxiety about the war, defended hisbrother and his colleagues thus: saying, ""he wondered by what fatalityit had occurred, that those who had been candidates for the decemvirate,should attack the decemvirs, either as secondaries,[145] or asprincipals: or when no one disputed for so many months whilst the statewas disengaged, whether legal magistrates had the management of affairs,why do they now sow discord, when the enemies are nearly at the gate;unless that in a state of confusion they think that what they are aimingat will be less seen through."" But that it was not just that any oneshould prejudice so important a cause, whilst our minds are occupiedwith a more momentous concern. It was his opinion, that the point whichValerius and Horatius urged, viz. that the decemvirs had gone out ofoffice before the ides of May, should be discussed in the senate, whenthe wars which are now impending are over, and the commonwealth has beenrestored to tranquillity: and that Appius Claudius should now prepare totake notice that an account is to be rendered by him of the comitiawhich he himself held for electing decemvirs, whether they were electedfor one year, or until the laws which were wanting were ratified. It washis opinion that all other matters should be laid aside for the present,except the war; and if they thought that the reports regarding it werepropagated without foundation, and that not only the couriers, but theambassadors of the Tusculans also had stated what was false, he thoughtthat scouts should be despatched to bring back more certain information;but if credit were given both to the couriers and the ambassadors, thatthe levy should be held at the very earliest opportunity; that thedecemvirs should lead the armies, whither it may seem proper to each;and that no other matter should take precedence."Book 3,Chapter 41,"The junior patricians succeeded in having this opinion carried.Valerius and Horatius rising again with greater vehemence demandedaloud, ""that it should be allowed them to express their sentimentsconcerning the republic; that they would address the people, if by afaction they were not allowed to do so in the senate. For that privateindividuals, either in the senate or in a general assembly, could notprevent them; nor would they yield to their imaginary fasces."" Appiusthen considering that the crisis was now nigh at hand, when theirauthority would be overpowered, unless their violence were resisted withequal boldness: ""It will be better,"" says he, ""not to utter a word onany subject, except that which we are now considering: and to Valerius,when he refused to be silent for a private individual, he commands alictor to proceed."" When Valerius, on the threshold of the senate-house,now craved the protection of the citizens, Lucius Cornelius, embracingAppius, put an end to the dispute, not consulting the interest of himwhose interest he affected to consult; and permission to speak hissentiments being obtained for Valerius through Cornelius, when thisliberty did not extend beyond words, the decemvirs obtained theirobject. The consulars also and senior members, from the hatred oftribunitian power still rankling in their bosoms, the desire of whichthey considered was much more keenly felt by the commons than that ofthe consular power, almost had rather that the decemvirs themselvesshould voluntarily resign their office at some future period, than thatthe people should rise once more into consequence through theirunpopularity. If the matter, conducted with gentleness, should againreturn to the consuls without popular turbulence, that the commons mightbe induced to forget their tribunes, either by the intervention of warsor by the moderation of the consuls in exercising their authority. Alevy is proclaimed amid the silence of the patricians; the young menanswer to their names, as the government was without appeal. The legionsbeing enrolled, the decemvirs set about arranging among themselves whoshould set out to the war, who command the armies. The leading men amongthe decemvirs were, Quintus Fabius and Appius Claudius. There appeared amore serious war at home than abroad. They considered the violence ofAppius as better suited to suppress commotions in the city; that Fabiuspossessed a disposition rather inconstant in good pursuits thanstrenuous in bad ones. For this man, formerly distinguished at home andabroad, his office of decemvir and his colleagues had so changed, thathe chose rather to be like to Appius than like himself. To him the waragainst the Sabines was committed, his colleagues, Manius Rabuleius andQuintus P¾telius, being sent with him. Marcus Cornelius was sent toAlgidum with Lucius Menucius and Titus Antonius, and C¾so Duilius andMarcus Sergius: they determine on Spurius Oppius as an assistant toAppius Claudius to protect the city, their authority being equal to thatof all the decemvirs."Book 3,Chapter 42,"The republic was managed with no better success in war than at home.In this the only fault in the generals was, that they had renderedthemselves objects of hatred to their fellow citizens: in other respectsthe whole fault lay with the soldiers; who, lest any enterprise shouldsucceed under the conduct and auspices of the decemvirs, sufferedthemselves to be beaten, to their own disgrace, and that of them (thegenerals). Their armies were routed by the Sabines at Eretum, and inAlgidum by the ®quans. Having fled from Eretum during the silence of thenight, they fortified their camp nearer to the city, on an elevatedsituation between Fiden¾ and Crustumeria; no where encountering theenemy, who pursued them, on equal ground, they protected themselves bythe nature of the place and a rampart, not by valour or arms. Greaterdisgrace and greater loss were sustained in Algidum, their camp also waslost; and the soldiers, stripped of all their utensils, betookthemselves to Tusculum, determined to procure the means of subsistencefrom the good faith and compassion of their hosts; which, however, didnot disappoint them. Such alarming accounts were brought to Rome, thatthe patricians, having laid aside their hatred of the decemvirs, passedan order that watches should be held in the city; commanded that all whowere able by reason of their age to carry arms, should mount guard onthe walls, and form out-posts before the gates; they also voted arms tobe sent to Tusculum, besides a reinforcement; that the decemvirs alsoshould come down from the citadel of Tusculum and keep their troopsencamped; that the other camp should be removed from Fiden¾ into theSabine territory; and that the enemy might be deterred, by thusattacking them first, from entertaining any intentions of attacking thecity."Book 3,Chapter 43,"To the calamities received from the enemy, the decemvirs add twoflagitious deeds, one abroad, and the other in the city. In the Sabinedistrict, Lucius Siccius, who, during the unpopularity of thedecemvirs, introduced, in secret conversation with the common soldiers,mention of electing tribunes and of a secession, was sent forwards toselect a place for a camp: instructions were given to the soldiers whomthey had sent to accompany him in that expedition, to attack him in aconvenient place and slay him. They did not kill him with impunity; forseveral of the assassins fell around him resisting them, whilst,possessing great personal strength and with a courage equal to thatstrength, he was defending himself against them, now surrounded as hewas. The rest bring an account into the camp that Siccius, when fightingbravely, had fallen into an ambush, and that some soldiers were lostwith him. At first the narrators were believed; afterwards a cohort,which went by permission of the decemvirs to bury those who had fallen,when they observed that none of the bodies there were stripped, thatSiccius lay in the middle with his arms, all the bodies being turnedtowards him, whilst there was neither any body of the enemy, nor evenany traces of them as going away; they brought back his body, saying,that he had certainly been slain by his own men. The camp was now filledwith indignation, and it was being determined that Siccius should beforthwith brought to Rome, had not the decemvirs hastened to perform amilitary funeral for him at the public expense. He was buried amid thegreat grief of the soldiery, and with the worst possible reputation ofthe decemvirs among the common people."Book 3,Chapter 44,"Another atrocious deed follows in the city, originating in lust,attended with results not less tragical than that deed which drove theTarquins from the city and the throne through the injured chastity andviolent death of Lucretia: so that the decemvirs not only had the sameend as the kings had, but the same cause also of losing their power.Appius Claudius was seized with a criminal passion for violating theperson of a young woman of plebeian condition. Lucius Virginius, thegirl's father, held an honourable rank among the centurions at Algidum,a man of exemplary good conduct both at home and in the service. Hiswife had been educated in a similar manner, as also were their children.He had betrothed his daughter to Lucius Icilius, who had been a tribune,a man of spirit and of approved zeal in the interest of the people. Thisyoung woman, in the bloom of youth, distinguished for beauty, Appius,burning with desire, attempted to seduce by bribes and promises; andwhen he perceived that all the avenues (to the possession of her) werebarred by modesty, he turned his thoughts to cruel and tyrannicalviolence. He instructed a dependent of his, Marcus Claudius, to claimthe girl as his slave, and not to yield to those who might demand herinterim retention of liberty; considering that, because the girl'sfather was absent, there was an opportunity for committing the injury.The tool of the decemvir's lust laid hands on the girl as she was cominginto the forum (for there in the sheds the literary schools were held);calling her ""the daughter of his slave and a slave herself,"" hecommanded her to follow him; that he would force her away if shedemurred. The girl being stupified with terror, a crowd collects at thecries of the girl's nurse, who besought the protection of the citizens.The popular names of her father, Virginius, and of her spouse, Icilius,are in the mouths of every one. Their regard for them gains over theiracquaintances, whilst the heinousness of the proceeding gains over thecrowd. She was now safe from violence, when the claimant says, ""thatthere was no occasion for raising a mob; that he was proceeding by law,not by force."" He cites the girl into court. Those who stood by heradvising her to follow him, they now reached the tribunal of Appius. Theclaimant rehearses the farce well known to the judge, as being theauthor of the plot, ""that a girl born in his house, and clandestinelytransferred from thence to the house of Virginius, had been fathered onthe latter."" That he stated a thing ascertained by certain evidence, andwould prove it to the satisfaction even of Virginius himself, whom theprincipal portion of that loss would concern. That it was but just thatin the interim the girl should accompany her master. The advocates forVirginia, after they had urged that Virginius was absent on business ofthe state, that he would be here in two days if word were sent to him,that it was unfair that in his absence he should run any risk regardinghis children, demand that he adjourn the whole matter till the arrivalof the father; that he should allow the claim for her interim libertyaccording to the law passed by himself, and not allow a maiden of ripeage to encounter the risk of her reputation before that of her liberty."Book 3,Chapter 45,"Appius prefaced his decree by observing that the very law, whichVirginius's friends were putting forward as the ground of their demand,clearly showed how much he favoured liberty. But that liberty would findsecure protection in it on this condition, that it varied[146] neitherwith respect to cases or persons.[147] For with respect to thoseindividuals who were claimed as free, that point of law was good,because[148] any person may proceed by law (and act for them); withrespect to her who is in the hands of her father, that there was noother person (than her father) to whom her master need relinquish hisright of possession. That it was his determination, therefore, that herfather should be sent for: in the mean time, that the claimant shouldsuffer no loss of his right, but that he should carry off the girl withhim, and promise that she should be produced on the arrival of him whowas called her father. When many rather murmured against the injusticeof this decision than any one individual ventured to protest against it,the girl's uncle, Publius Numitorius, and her betrothed spouse, Icilius,just come in; and way being made through the crowd, the multitudethinking that Appius might be most effectually resisted by theintervention of Icilius, the lictor declares that ""he had decided thematter,"" and removes Icilius, when he attempted to raise his voice.Injustice so atrocious would have fired even a cool temper. ""By thesword, Appius,"" says he, ""I must be removed hence, that you may carryoff in silence that which you wish to be concealed. This young woman Iam about to marry, determined to have a lawful and chaste wife.Wherefore call together all the lictors even of your colleagues; orderthe rods and axes to be had in readiness; the betrothed wife of Iciliusshall not remain without her father's house. Though you have taken fromus the aid of our tribunes, and the power of appeal to the commons ofRome, the two bulwarks for maintaining our liberty, absolute dominionhas not therefore been given to you over our wives and children. Ventyour fury on our backs and necks; let chastity at least be secure. Ifviolence be offered to her, I shall implore the protection of thecitizens here present in behalf of my spouse; Virginius will implorethat of the soldiers in behalf of his only daughter; we shall allimplore the protection of gods and men, nor shall you carry thatsentence into effect without our blood. I demand of you, Appius,consider again and again to what lengths you are proceeding. LetVirginius, when he comes, consider what conduct he should pursue withrespect to his daughter. Let him only be assured of this, that if heyield to the claims of this man, he will have to seek out another matchfor his daughter. As for my part, in vindicating the liberty of myspouse, life shall leave me sooner than my honour."""Book 3,Chapter 46,"The multitude was now excited, and a contest seemed likely to ensue.The lictors had taken their stand around Icilius; nor did they, however,proceed beyond threats, when Appius said, ""that it was not Virginia thatwas defended by Icilius, but that, being a restless man, and even nowbreathing the spirit of the tribuneship, he was seeking an occasion fora disturbance. That he would not afford him material on that day; but inorder that he may now know that the concession has been made not to hispetulance, but to the absent Virginius, to the name of father and toliberty, that he would not decide the cause on that day, nor interpose adecree: that he would request of Marcus Claudius to forego somewhat ofhis right, and suffer the girl to be bailed till the next day. Butunless the father attended on the following day, he gave notice toIcilius and to men like Icilius, that neither the founder would bewanting to his own law, nor firmness to the decemvir; nor would heassemble the lictors of his colleagues to put down the promoters ofsedition; that he would be content with his own lictors."" When the timeof this act of injustice was deferred, and the friends of the maiden hadretired, it was first of all determined, that the brother of Icilius andthe son of Numitorius, both active young men, should proceed thencestraightforward to the gate, and that Virginius should be brought fromthe camp with all possible haste. That the safety of the girl dependedon his being present next day at the proper time, as her protector frominjury. They proceed according to directions and with all speed carrythe account to her father. When the claimant of the maiden was pressingIcilius to become defendant, and give sureties,[149] and Icilius saidthat that was the very thing he was doing, designedly spinning out thetime, until the messengers sent to the camp might gain time for theirjourney, the multitude raised their hands on all sides, and every oneshowed himself ready to go surety for Icilius. And he with tears in hiseyes says, It is very kind of you; on to-morrow I will avail myself ofyour assistance; at present I have sufficient sureties. Thus Virginia isbailed on the security of her relations. Appius having delayed a shorttime, that he might not appear to have sat on account of the presentcase, when no one applied, all other concerns being given up by reasonof their solicitude about the one, betook himself home, and writes tohis colleagues to the camp, ""not to grant leave of absence to Virginius,and even to keep him in confinement."" This wicked scheme was late, as itdeserved to be; for Virginius, having already obtained his leave, hadset out at the first watch, while the letter regarding his detention wasdelivered on the following morning to no purpose."Book 3,Chapter 47,"But in the city, when the citizens were standing in the forum erectwith expectation, Virginius, clad in mourning, by break of day conductshis daughter, also attired in weeds, attended by some matrons, into theforum, with a considerable body of advocates. He then began to go roundand to solicit individuals; and not only to entreat their aid as a boonto his prayers, but demanded it as due to him: ""that he stood daily inthe field of battle in defence of their children and wives, nor wasthere any other man, to whom a greater number of brave and intrepiddeeds in war can be ascribed than to him. What availed it, if, whilstthe city was still secure, their children would be exposed to suffer theseverest hardships which would have to be dreaded if it was taken?""Delivering these observations like one haranguing in an assembly, hesolicited them individually. Similar arguments were used by Icilius: thefemale attendants produced more effect by their silent tears than anylanguage. With a mind utterly insensible to all this, (such, a paroxysmof madness, rather than of love, had perverted his mind,) Appiusascended the tribunal; and when the claimant began to complain briefly,that justice had not been administered to him on the preceding daythrough a desire to please the people, before either he could go throughwith his claim, or an opportunity of reply was afforded to Virginius,Appius interrupts him. The preamble with which he prefaced the sentence,ancient authors may have handed down perhaps with truth; because I nowhere find any one that was likely (to have been used) on so scandalousa business, it seems, that the naked fact should be stated as being apoint which is agreed on, viz. that he passed a sentence[150] consigningher to slavery. At first all were astounded with amazement at soheinous a proceeding; then silence prevailed for some time. Then whenMarcus Claudius proceeded to seize the maiden, the matrons standingaround her, and was received with piteous lamentation of the women,Virginius, menacingly extending his hands towards Appius, says, ToIcilius, and not to you, Appius, have I betrothed my daughter, and formatrimony, not prostitution, have I brought her up. Do you wish men togratify their lust promiscuously, like cattle and wild beasts? Whetherthese persons will endure such things, I know not; I hope that thosewill not who have arms in their hands. When the claimant of the girl wasrepulsed by the crowd of women and advocates who were standing aroundher, silence was commanded by the crier."Book 3,Chapter 48,"The decemvir, engrossed in mind by his lustful propensities, statesthat not only from the abusive language of Icilius yesterday, and theviolence of Virginius, of which he had the entire Roman people aswitnesses, but from authentic information also he ascertained, thatcabals were held in the city during the whole night to stir up asedition. Accordingly that he, being aware of that danger, had come downwith armed soldiers; not that he would molest any peaceable person, butin order to punish suitably to the majesty of the government personsdisturbing the tranquillity of the state. It will, therefore, be betterto remain quiet. Go, lictor, says he, remove the crowd; and make way forthe master to lay hold of his slave. When, bursting with passion, he hadthundered out these words, the multitude themselves voluntarilyseparated, and the girl stood deserted a prey to injustice. ThenVirginius, when he saw no aid any where, says, I beg you, Appius, firstpardon a father's grief, if I have said any thing too harsh against you:in the next place, suffer me to question the nurse before the maiden,what all this matter is? that if I have been falsely called her father,I may depart hence with a more resigned mind. Permission being granted,he draws the girl and the nurse aside to the sheds near the temple ofCloacina, which now go by the name of the new sheds: and there snatchingup a knife from a butcher, ""In this one way, the only one in my power,do I secure to you your liberty."" He then transfixes the girl's breast,and looking back towards the tribunal, he says, ""With this blood Idevote thee, Appius, and thy head."" Appius, aroused by the cry raised atso dreadful a deed, orders Virginius to be seized. He, armed with theknife, cleared the way whithersoever he went, until, protected by thecrowd of persons attending him, he reached the gate. Icilius andNumitorius take up the lifeless body and exhibit it to the people: theydeplore the villany of Appius, the fatal beauty of the maiden, and thedire necessity of the father. The matrons who followed exclaim, ""Wasthis the condition of rearing children? were these the rewards ofchastity?"" and other things which female grief on such occasionssuggests, when their complaints are so much the more affecting, inproportion as (their grief) is more intense from the natural tendernessof their minds. The voice of the men, and more especially of Icilius,entirely turned on the tribunitian power, on the right of appeal to thepeople which had been taken from them, and on the indignities thrownupon the state."Book 3,Chapter 49,"The multitude was excited partly by the atrocious nature of thedeed, partly by the hope of recovering their liberty through afavourable opportunity. Appius now orders Icilius to be summoned beforehim, now on refusing to come to be seized; at length, when anopportunity of approaching him was not afforded to the beadles, hehimself proceeding through the crowd with a body of young patricians,orders him to be taken into confinement. Now not only the multitude, butLucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius, the leaders of the multitude, stoodaround Icilius: who, having repulsed the lictor, stated, that ""if hemeant to proceed by law, they would protect Icilius from one who was buta private citizen; if he desired to employ force, that they would be nobad match for him even then."" Hence arises a furious scuffle. Thedecemvir's lictor attacks Valerius and Horatius: the fasces are brokenby the people. Appius ascends the tribunal; Horatius and Valerius followhim. To them the assembly pays attention, they drown with clamour thevoice of the decemvir. Now Valerius authoritatively ordered the lictorsto depart from one who was but a private citizen: when Appius, whosespirits were now broken, being alarmed for his life, betook himself intoa house in the vicinity of the forum, unknown to his enemies, with hishead covered up. Spurius Oppius, in order to assist his colleague,rushes into the forum from the opposite side; he sees their authorityoverpowered by force. Distracted then by various counsels between whichhe wavered, by assenting to several advisers from every side, heeventually ordered the senate to be convened. Because the proceedings ofthe decemvirs seemed to be displeasing to the greater portion of thepatricians, this step quieted the people with the hope that thegovernment would be abolished through the senate. The senate gave theiropinion that neither the commons should be exasperated, and much morethat care should be taken that the arrival of Virginius should notoccasion any commotion in the army."Book 3,Chapter 50,"Accordingly some of the junior patricians, being sent to the campwhich was at that time on Mount Vecilius, announce to the decemvirs""that by every means in their power they should keep the soldiers frommutinying."" Where Virginius occasioned greater commotion than he hadleft behind him in the city. For besides that he was seen coming with abody of near four hundred men, who, fired at the heinous enormity of theoccurrence, had accompanied him from the city; the unsheathed weapon andhimself besmeared with blood, attracted to him the entire camp; and thegowns[151] seen in the different parts of the camp, had caused thenumber of people from the city to appear much greater than it reallywas. When they asked him what was the matter, in consequence of hisweeping he uttered not a word. At length, as soon as the crowd of thoserunning together became still, and silence took place, he related everything in order as it occurred. Then extending his hands towards heaven,addressing his fellow soldiers, he begged of them, ""not to impute to himthat which was the crime of Appius, not to abhor him as the murderer ofhis children."" To him the life of his daughter was dearer than his own,if she had been allowed to live in freedom and chastity. When he beheldher dragged to prostitution as if a slave, thinking it better that hischild should be lost by death than by dishonour, through compassion forher he fell into an appearance of cruelty. Nor would he have survivedhis daughter, had he not placed hope of avenging her death in the aid ofhis fellow soldiers. For that they too had daughters, sisters, andwives; nor was the lust of Appius Claudius extinguished with hisdaughter; but in proportion as it escaped with impunity, so much themore unbridled would it be. That in the calamities of others a warningwas given to them to guard against a similar injury. That for his ownpart, his wife had been taken from him by fate; his daughter, becauseshe no longer could live in chastity, died an unfortunate but honourabledeath; that there was no longer in his house an opportunity for Appius'slust; that from any other violence of his he would defend his personwith the same spirit with which he vindicated that of his daughter. Thatothers should take care of themselves and of their children. ToVirginius, uttering these words in a loud voice, the multitude respondedwith a shout, ""that they would not be backward, with respect either tohis wrongs or their own liberty. And the gown-men mixing with the crowdof soldiers, both by narrating with sorrow those same circumstances, andby showing how much more shocking they must have appeared when seen thanwhen merely heard, and also by telling them that matters were nowdesperate at Rome; those also who followed (the persons that accompaniedVirginius from Rome) and alleged that Appius, having with difficultyescaped with life, had gone into exile;[152] all these individuals sofar influenced them that there was a general cry to arms, they snatchedup their standards, and set out for Rome."" The decemvirs, being alarmedat the same time both by what they now saw, as well as by those thingswhich they had heard had taken place at Rome, ran about to differentparts of the camp to quell the commotion. Whilst they proceeded withmildness no answer was returned to them. If any of them attempted toexert authority over them, the answer given was, that ""they were men andhad arms."" They go in a body to the city and post themselves on theAventine; encouraging the commons, according as each person met them, toreassume their liberty, and elect tribunes of the people; no otherviolent expression was heard. Spurius Oppius holds a meeting of thesenate; it is resolved that no harsh proceedings should be adopted, asoccasion for the sedition had been given by themselves. Three men ofconsular rank, Spurius Tarpeius, Caius Julius, Publius Sulpicius, aresent as ambassadors, to inquire, in the name of the senate, by whoseorders they had deserted the camp? or what they intended in postingthemselves on the Aventine in arms, and in turning away their arms fromthe enemy and taking their own country? They were at no loss for ananswer; they wanted some one to give the answer, there being as yet nocertain leader, and individuals not being forward enough to exposethemselves to the invidious office. The multitude only called out withone voice, that they should send Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius tothem: that to them they would give their answer."Book 3,Chapter 51,"The ambassadors being dismissed, Virginius reminds the soldiers""that a little time before they had been embarrassed in a matter of novery great difficulty, because the multitude was without a head; andthat the answer given, though not inexpedient, was the result rather ofan accidental concurrence than of a concerted plan. His opinion was,that ten persons be elected, who should preside in the management oftheir affairs, and, in the style of military dignity, that they shouldbe called tribunes of the soldiers."" When that honour was offered tohimself in the first instance, he replied, ""Reserve for an occasion morefavourable to you and to me those your kind opinions of me. My daughterbeing unavenged, neither allows any honour to be satisfactory to me, norin the disturbed state of things is it useful that those should be atyour head who are most obnoxious to party malice. If there will be anyuse of me, such use will be derived not in a less degree from me in aprivate station."" They then elect military tribunes ten in number. Norwas the army among the Sabines inactive. There also, at the instance ofIcilius and Numitorius, a secession from the decemvirs took place, thecommotion of men's minds on recollecting the murder of Siccius being notless than that, which the recent account of the barbarous attempt madeon the maiden to gratify lust had enkindled. When Icilius heard thattribunes of the soldiers were elected on Mount Aventine, lest theelection-assembly in the city might follow the precedent of the militaryassembly, by electing the same persons tribunes of the commons, beingwell versed in popular intrigues and having an eye to that office, healso takes care, before they proceeded to the city, that the same numberbe elected by his own party with an equal power. They entered the citythrough the Colline gate in military array, and proceeded in a body tothe Aventine through the middle of the city. There, joined to the otherarmy, they commissioned the twenty tribunes of the soldiers to selecttwo out of their number, who should hold the command in chief. Theychoose Marcus Oppius and Sextus Manilius. The patricians, alarmed forthe general safety, though there was a meeting every day, waste the timein wrangling more frequently than in deliberation. The murder ofSiccius, the lust of Appius, and the disgraces incurred in war wereurged as charges against the decemvirs. It was resolved that Valeriusand Horatius should proceed to the Aventine. They refused to go on anyother conditions, than that the decemvirs should lay down the badges ofthat office, which had expired the year before. The decemvirs,complaining that they were now being degraded, stated that they wouldnot resign their office, until those laws were passed on account ofwhich they had been appointed."Book 3,Chapter 52,"The people being informed through Marcus Duilius, who had beentribune of the people, that by reason of their continual contentions nobusiness was transacted, passes from the Aventine to the Sacred mount;Duilius affirming that serious concern for business would not enter theminds of the patricians, until they saw the city deserted. That theSacred mount would remind them of the people's firmness; that they wouldthen know, that matters could not be restored to concord without therestoration of (the tribunitian) power. Having set out along theNomentan way, which was then called the Ficulnean, they pitched theircamp on the Sacred mount, imitating the moderation of their fathers bycommitting no violence. The commons followed the army, no one whose agewould permit him declining to go. Their wives and children attendedtheir steps, piteously asking to whom would they leave them, in a cityin which neither chastity nor liberty were respected? When the unusualsolitude rendered every place in Rome void; when there was in the forumno one but a few old men; when, the patricians being convened into thesenate, the forum appeared deserted; more now besides Horatius andValerius began to exclaim, ""What will ye now wait for, conscriptfathers? If the decemvirs do not put an end to their obstinacy, will yesuffer all things to go to wreck and ruin? What power is that,decemvirs, which ye embrace and hold so firmly? do you mean toadminister justice to walls and mere houses? Are you not ashamed that analmost greater number of your lictors is to be seen in the forum than ofthe other citizens? What are ye to do, in case the enemy should approachthe city? What, if the commons should come presently in arms, if we seemnot to be moved by their secession? do you mean to conclude your powerby the fall of the city? But (the case is this,) either we must not havethe commons, or they must have their tribunes. We would sooner dispensewith our patrician magistrates, than they with their plebeian. Thatpower, when new and untried, they wrested from our fathers; much lesswill they, now that they have tested the sweets of it, endure its loss:more especially since we make not a moderate use of our power, so thatthey may not stand in need of (tribunitian) aid."" When these argumentswere thrown out from every quarter, the decemvirs, overpowered by theunited opinions of all, declare that, since such seems to be thefeeling, they would submit to the authority of the patricians. All theyask is, that they may be protected from popular rage; they give awarning, that they should not through shedding their blood habituate thepeople to inflict punishment on the patricians."Book 3,Chapter 53,"Then Valerius and Horatius, having been sent to bring back thepeople on such terms as might seem fit, and to adjust all differences,are directed to make provision also for the decemvirs from theresentment and violence of the multitude. They set forward and arereceived into the camp with great joy by the people, as being theirliberators beyond all doubt, both at the commencement of the disturbanceand at the termination of the matter. In consideration of these things,thanks were returned to them on their arrival. Icilius speaks in thename of the people. When the terms came to be considered, theambassadors inquiring what were the demands of the people, the sameindividual, having already concerted the plan before the arrival of theambassadors, stated demands of such a nature, that it became evident,that more hope was placed in the justice of their case than in arms. Forthey demanded back the tribunitian office and the right of appeal,which, before the appointment of decemvirs, had been the props of thepeople, and that it should not be visited with injury to any one, tohave instigated the soldiers or the commons to seek back their libertyby a secession. Concerning the punishment only of the decemvirs wastheir demand immoderate; for they thought it but just that they shouldbe delivered up to them; and they threatened that they would burn themalive. In answer the ambassadors say, the demands which have been theresult of deliberation are so reasonable, that they should bevoluntarily offered to you; for you seek them as safeguards to yourliberty, not as means of licentious power to assail others. Yourresentment we must rather pardon than indulge; seeing that from yourhatred of cruelty ye rush into cruelty, and almost before you are freeyourselves, you wish already to lord it over your enemies. Shall ourstate never enjoy rest from punishments, either of the patricians on theRoman commons, or of the commons on the patricians? you have occasionfor a shield rather than for a sword. He is sufficiently and abundantlyhumble, who lives in a state on an equal footing, neither inflicting norsuffering injury. Moreover, ""should you feel disposed to renderyourselves formidable, when, having recovered your magistrates and laws,decisions on our lives and fortunes shall be in your hands; then youshall determine according to the merits of each case; now it issufficient that your liberty be restored."""Book 3,Chapter 54,"All permitting them to act just as they think proper, theambassadors assure them that they would speedily return, havingcompleted every matter. When they went and laid before the patriciansthe message of the commons, the other decemvirs, since, contrary totheir own expectation, no mention was made of their punishment, raisedno objection. Appius, being of a truculent disposition and a particularobject of detestation, measuring the rancour of others towards him byhis own towards them, says, ""I am aware of the fate which hangs over me.I see that the contest against us is deferred, until our arms aredelivered up to our adversaries. Blood must be offered up to popularrage. Not even do I demur to resign my decemvirate."" A decree of thesenate is then passed, ""that the decemvirs should without delay resigntheir office; that Quintus Furius, chief pontiff, should hold anelection of plebeian tribunes, and that the secession of the soldiersand commons should not be visited on any one."" These decrees beingfinished, the senate being dismissed, the decemvirs come forth into theassembly, and resign their office, to the great joy of all. News of thisis carried to the commons. All the people remaining in the city escortthe ambassadors. This crowd was met by another joyous body from thecamp; they congratulate each other on the restoration of peace andconcord to the state. The deputies address the assembly: ""Be itadvantageous, fortunate, and happy for you and the republic, return intoyour country to your household gods, your wives and children; but carryinto the city the same modesty which you observed here, where, amid theconsumption of so many matters necessary for so large a number ofpersons, no man's field has been injured. Go to the Aventine, whence yeset out. In that auspicious place, where ye took the first step towardsliberty, ye shall elect tribunes of the people. The chief pontiff willbe at hand to hold the elections."" Great was their assent and joy, asevinced in their approbation of every measure. They then hastily raisetheir standards, and having set out for Rome, vie in exultation with allthey met. There, the chief pontiff holding the meeting for theelections, they elected as their tribunes of the people, first of all A.Virginius, then Lucius Icilius, and Publius Numitorius the uncle ofVirginia, the advisers of the secession. Then Caius Sicinius, theoffspring of him who is recorded to have been elected first tribune ofthe commons on the Sacred mount; and Marcus Duilius, who had passedthrough a distinguished tribuneship before the creation of thedecemvirs, and was never wanting to the commons in their contests withthe decemvirs. Marcus Titinius, Marcus Pomponius, Caius Apronius,Publius Villius, and Caius Oppius, were elected more from hope(entertained of them) than from any services (performed). When heentered on his tribuneship, Lucius Icilius proposed to the commons, andthe commons ordered, that the secession from the decemvirs which hadtaken place should not prove detrimental to any individual. Immediatelyafter Duilius carried a proposition for electing consuls, with right ofappeal. All these things were transacted in an assembly of the commonsin the Flaminian meadows, which they now call the Flaminian circus."Book 3,Chapter 55,"Then through an interrex Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius wereelected consuls, who immediately entered on their office; whoseconsulship was popular without any actual injury to the patricians,though not without their displeasure; for whatever provision was madefor securing the liberty of the commons, that they considered to be adiminution made in their own power. First of all, when it was as it werea point in controversy, whether patricians were bound by regulationsenacted in an assembly of the commons, they proposed a law in theassembly of the centuries, that whatever the commons orderedcollectively, should bind the entire people; by which law a mostkeen-edged weapon was given to motions introduced by tribunes. Thenanother law made by a consul concerning the right of appeal, a singularsecurity to liberty, and subverted by the decemviral power, they notonly restore, but guard it also for the time to come, by enacting a newlaw, ""that no one should appoint any magistrate without a right ofappeal; if any person should so elect, it would be lawful and right thathe be put to death; and that such killing should not be deemed a capitaloffence."" And when they had sufficiently secured the commons by theright of appeal on the one hand, by tribunitian aid on the other, theyrenewed for the tribunes themselves (the privilege) that they should beheld sacred and inviolable, the memory of which matter had now beenalmost lost, reviving certain ceremonies which had been long disused;and they rendered them inviolable both by the religious institution, aswell as by a law, enacting, that ""whoever should offer injury totribunes of the people, ¾diles, judges, decemvirs, his person should bedevoted to Jupiter, and his property be sold at the temple of Ceres,Liber and Libera."" Commentators deny that any person is by this lawsacrosanct; but that he who may do an injury to any of them, is deemedto be devoted; therefore that an ¾dile may be arrested and carried toprison by superior magistrates, which, though it be not expresslywarranted by law, for an injury is done to a person to whom it is notlawful to do an injury according to this law, yet it is a proof that an¾dile is not considered as sacred; that the tribunes were sacred andinviolable by an ancient oath of the commons, when first they createdthat office. There have been persons who supposed that by this sameHoratian law provision was made for the consuls also and the pr¾tors,because they were elected under the same auspices as the consuls; forthat a consul was called a judge. Which interpretation is refuted,because at this time it was not yet the custom for the consul to bestyled judge, but the pr¾tor. These were the laws proposed by theconsuls. It was also regulated by the same consuls, that decrees of thesenate should be deposited with the ¾diles of the commons in the templeof Ceres; which before that used to be suppressed and altered at thepleasure of the consuls. Marcus Duilius then, tribune of the commons,proposed to the people, and the people ordered, that ""whoever left thepeople without tribunes, and whoever caused a magistrate to be electedwithout the right of appeal, should be punished with stripes andbeheaded."" All these matters, though against the feelings of thepatricians, passed off without opposition from them, because no severitywas aimed at any particular individual."Book 3,Chapter 56,"Then both the tribunitian power and the liberty of the commons beingfirmly established, the tribunes now deeming it both safe and seasonableto attack individuals, single out Virginius as the first prosecutor andAppius as defendant. When Virginius appointed a day for Appius, andAppius came down to the forum, accompanied by some young patricians, thememory of his most profligate exercise of power was instantly revived inthe minds of all, as soon as they beheld himself and his satellites.Then Virginius says, ""Long speeches have been invented for matters of adoubtful nature. Accordingly I shall neither waste time in dwelling onthe guilt of this man before you, from whose cruelty ye have rescuedyourselves by force of arms, nor shall I suffer him to add impudence tohis other enormous crimes in defending himself. Wherefore, AppiusClaudius, I remit to you the accumulated impious and nefarious deeds youhave had the effrontery to commit for the last two years; with respectto one charge only, unless you will appoint a judge, (and prove) thatyou have not, contrary to the laws, sentenced a free person to be aslave, I order that you be taken into custody."" Neither in the aid ofthe tribunes, nor in the judgment of the people, could Appius place anyhope: still he both appealed to the tribunes, and, when no one regardedhim, being seized by the bailiff, he exclaims, ""I appeal."" The hearingof this one expression, that safeguard of liberty, uttered from thatmouth by which a free citizen was so recently consigned to slavery,occasioned general silence. And, whilst they observe to each other,that ""at length there are gods, and that they do not disregard humanaffairs; and that punishments await tyranny and cruelty, which, thoughlate, are still by no means light; that he now appealed, who hadabolished all right of appeal; and that he implored the protection ofthe people, who had trampled down all the rights of the people; and thathe was dragged off to prison, destitute of the rights of liberty, whohad doomed a free person to slavery."" Amid the murmurs of the assembly,the voice of Appius was heard imploring the protection of the Romanpeople. He enumerated the services of his ancestors to the state, athome and abroad; his own unfortunate zeal towards the Roman commons;that he had resigned the consulship, to the great displeasure of thepatricians, for the purpose of equalizing the laws; (he then mentioned)his laws; which, though they still remained in force, the framer of themwas dragged to a prison. But the peculiar advantages and disadvantagesof his case he would then make trial of, when an opportunity would beafforded him of stating his defence. At present, he, a Roman citizen,demanded, by the common right of citizenship, that he be allowed tospeak on the day appointed, and to appeal to the judgment of the Romanpeople. That he did not dread popular rage so much as not to place anyhope in the equity and compassion of his fellow citizens. But if he wereled to prison without being heard, that he once more appealed to thetribunes of the people, and warned them not to imitate those whom theyhated. But if the tribunes acknowledge themselves bound in the sameconfederacy for abolishing the right of appeal, which they charged thedecemvirs with having formed, then he appealed to the people: heimplored the benefit of the laws passed that very year, both by theconsuls and tribunes, regarding the right of appeal. For who wouldappeal, if this were not allowed a person as yet uncondemned, whose casehas not been heard? what plebeian and humble individual would findprotection in the laws, if Appius Claudius could not? that he wouldafford a proof, whether tyranny or liberty was established by the newlaws; and whether the right of appeal and of challenge against theinjustice of magistrates was only held out in empty words, oreffectually granted."Book 3,Chapter 57,"Virginius, on the other hand, affirmed that Appius Claudius was theonly person not entitled to a participation in the laws, nor in civil orhuman society. That men should look to the tribunal, the fortress of allvillanies; where that perpetual decemvir, venting his fury on theproperties, backs, and blood of the citizens, threatening all with hisrods and axes, a despiser of gods and men, attended with executioners,not lictors, changing his mind from rapine and murder to lust, beforethe eyes of the Roman people, tore a free-born maiden, as if a prisonerof war, from the embraces of her father, and gave her as a present to adependant, the pander to his secret pleasures. Where by a cruel decree,and by a most villainous decision, he armed the right hand of the fatheragainst the daughter: where he ordered the spouse and uncle, on theirraising the lifeless body of the girl, to be taken off to a prison;moved more at the interruption to his sensual gratification than at heruntimely death. That the prison was built for him also, which he used tocall the domicile of the Roman commons. Wherefore, though he may appealagain and oftener, he would as frequently refer him to a judge, on thecharge of having sentenced a free person to slavery; if he would not gobefore a judge, that he ordered him to be taken to prison as onecondemned. He was thrown into prison, and though without thedisapprobation of any individual, yet not without considerable emotionsof the public mind, when, in consequence of the punishment of sodistinguished a man, their own liberty began to appear to the commonsthemselves as excessive. The tribune deferred the day of trial. Whilstthese matters are going on, ambassadors from the Hernicians and Latinscame to Rome to present their congratulations on the harmony subsistingbetween the patricians and commons; and as an offering on that accountto Jupiter, the best and greatest, they brought into the Capitol agolden crown, of small weight, as riches at that time did not abound,and the duties of religion were performed rather with piety thanmagnificence. From the same source it was ascertained that the ®quansand Volscians were preparing for war with the utmost energy. The consulswere therefore ordered to divide the provinces between them. The Sabinesfell to the lot of Horatius, the ®quans and Volscians to that ofValerius. On their proclaiming a levy for these wars, through the goodwishes of the commons, not only the younger men, but of those who hadserved out their time, a considerable portion as volunteers, attended togive in their names: and hence the army was stronger not only by thenumber, but also by the kind of soldiers, veterans being mixed withthem. Before they marched out of the city, they engraved on brass, andfixed up in public view, the decemviral laws, which have received thename of ""the twelve tables."" There are some who state that the ¾dilesdischarged that office by order of the tribunes."Book 3,Chapter 58,"Caius Claudius, who, detesting the crimes of the decemvirs and,above all, incensed at the arrogant conduct of his brother's son, hadretired to Regillum, the country of his forefathers, having returned,though now advanced in years, to deprecate the dangers impending overthat man, whose vices he had shunned, now clad in a mourning garment,with the members of his family and his clients, went about the forum,and solicited the interest of the citizens individually, ""That theywould not cast such a stain on the Claudian family, as to consider themdeserving of imprisonment and chains; that a man whose image would bemost highly honoured with posterity, the framer of their laws and thefounder of Roman jurisprudence, lay in chains amongst nightly thievesand robbers. (He begged) that they would turn away their minds fromresentment for a while to examination and reflection; and rather pardonone at the intercession of so many members of the Claudian family, thanthrough a hatred of one spurn the entreaties of many; that he himselfalso paid this tribute to the family and the name; nor had he beenreconciled to him, whose unfortunate situation he wished to relieve;that by fortitude liberty had been recovered; by clemency the harmony ofthe several orders might be established."" Some there were whom heinfluenced more by his warm attachment to his family than for the sakeof him for whom he interceded. But Virginius begged that ""they wouldrather pity him and his daughter; and that they would listen to theentreaties, not of the Claudian family, which had assumed a sort ofsovereignty over the commons, but those of the near friends of Virginiaand of the three tribunes; who having been created for the aid of thecommons, were now themselves imploring the protection and aid of thecommons."" These tears appeared more just. Accordingly, all hope beingcut off, Appius put a period to his life, before the day arrivedappointed for his trial. Soon after, Spurius Oppius, the next object ofpublic indignation, as having been in the city when the unjust decisionwas given by his colleague, was arraigned by Publius Numitorius.However, an act of injustice committed by Oppius brought more odium onhim, than the not preventing one (in the case of Appius). A witness wasbrought forward, who, after reckoning up twenty campaigns, after havingbeen particularly honoured eight different times, and wearing thesehonours in the sight of the Roman people, tore open his garment andexhibited his back torn with stripes, asking no other conditions but""that, if the accused could name any one guilty act of his, he might,though a private individual, once more repeat his severity on him.""Oppius was also thrown into prison, where he put a period to his lifebefore the day of trial. The tribunes confiscated the property of Appiusand Oppius. Their colleagues left their homes to go into exile; theirproperty was confiscated. Marcus Claudius, the claimant of Virginia,being condemned on the day of his trial, was discharged and went awayinto exile to Tibur, Virginius himself remitting the penalty as far asit affected his life; and the shade of Virginia, more fortunate afterdeath than when living, after having roamed through so many families inquest of vengeance, at length rested in peace, no guilty person beingleft unpunished."Book 3,Chapter 59,"Great alarm seized the patricians, and the countenances of thetribunes were now the same as those of the decemvirs had been, whenMarcus Duilius, tribune of the people, having put a salutary check totheir immoderate power, says, ""There has been both enough of liberty onour own part, and of vengeance on our enemies; wherefore for this year Iwill neither suffer a day of trial to be appointed for any one, nor anyperson to be thrown into prison. For it is neither pleasing to me thatold crimes now forgotten should be again brought forward, seeing thatthe recent ones have been atoned for by the punishment of the decemvirs;and the unremitting care of both the consuls in defending yourliberties, is ample security that nothing will be committed which willcall for tribunitian interference."" This moderation of the tribune firstrelieved the patricians from their fears, and at the same time increasedtheir ill-will towards the consuls; for they had been so devoted to thecommons, that even a plebeian magistrate took an earlier interest inthe safety and liberty of the patricians, than one of patrician rank;and their enemies would have been surfeited with inflicting punishmentson them, before the consuls, to all appearance, would have resistedtheir licentious career. And there were many who said that a want offirmness was shown, inasmuch as the fathers had given their approbationto the laws proposed; nor was there a doubt, but that in this troubledstate of public affairs they had yielded to the times."Book 3,Chapter 60,"The business in the city being settled, and the rights of thecommons being firmly established, the consuls departed to theirrespective provinces. Valerius prudently deferred all warlike operationsagainst the armies of the ®quans and the Volscians, which had now formeda junction at Algidum. But if he had immediately committed the result tofortune, I know not but that, such were the feelings both of the Romansand of their enemies since the unfavourable auspices of the decemvirs,the contest would have stood them in a heavy loss. Having pitched hiscamp at the distance of a mile from the enemy, he kept his men quiet.The enemy filled the space lying between the two camps with their armyin order of battle, and not a single Roman made them any answer whenthey challenged them to battle. At length, wearied from standing andfrom waiting in vain for a contest, the ®quans and Volscians,considering that the victory was in a manner conceded to them, go off,some to the Hernicians, some to the Latins, to commit depredations.There was left in the camp rather a garrison for its defence thansufficient force for a contest. When the consul perceived this, heretorted the terror previously occasioned to his men, and drawing up histroops in order of battle, he now in his turn provokes the enemy tofight. When they, from a feeling of the absence of their forces,declined battle, the courage of the Romans immediately increased, andthey considered as vanquished those who stood panic-stricken withintheir rampart. After having stood for the entire day prepared for thecontest, they retired at night. And the Romans, now full of hope, setabout refreshing themselves. The enemy, in by no means equal spirits,being now in trepidation, despatch messengers in every direction to callback the plundering parties. Those in the nearest places return thence;those who were farther off were not found. When the day dawned, theRomans leave the camp, determining on assaulting the rampart unless anopportunity of fighting were afforded; and when the day was now faradvanced, and no movement was made by the enemy, the consul orders themto advance; and the troops being put in motion, the ®quans and theVolscians became indignant, that victorious armies were to be defendedby a rampart rather than by valour and arms. Wherefore they alsoearnestly demanded the signal for battle from their generals, andreceived it. And now half of them had got out of the gates, and theothers in succession were observing order, marching down each to his ownpost, when the Roman consul, before the enemy's line could be drawn up,supported by their entire strength, advanced on them; and havingattacked them before they were all as yet led forth, and when those whowere so had not their ranks sufficiently arranged, he falls on theunsteady crowd of them, running in trepidation from one place toanother, and throwing around their eyes on themselves and on theirfriends, a shout and violent onset adding to the already confused stateof their minds. The enemy at first gave way; then, when they had ralliedtheir spirits, and their generals on every side reprovingly asked them,whether they were about to yield to their vanquished foes, the battlewas restored."Book 3,Chapter 61,"On the other side, the consul desired the Romans to remember that""on that day, for the first time, they fought as free men in defence ofRome, now a free city. That it was for themselves they were to conquer,and not that they should be the prize of the decemvirs, afterconquering. That it was not under the command of Appius that the actionwas being conducted, but under their consul Valerius, descended from theliberators of the Roman people, himself too a liberator. That theyshould show that in former battles it had been the fault of thegenerals, and not of the soldiers, that they did not conquer. That itwas shameful to have had more courage against their own countrymen thanagainst their enemies, and to have dreaded slavery more at home thanabroad. That Virginia was the only person whose chastity was in dangerin time of peace: that Appius was the only citizen of dangerous lust.But if the fortune of war should turn against them, all their childrenwould be in danger from so many thousands of enemies. That he wouldnot, on account of the omen, mention things which may neither Jupiternor their father Mars suffer to befall a city built under suchauspices."" He reminded them of the Aventine and the Sacred mount; and""that they should bring back dominion unimpaired to that spot, wheretheir liberty had been established but a few months before: and thatthey should show that the Roman soldiers retained the same abilitiesafter the expulsion of the decemvirs, which they had possessed beforethey were appointed; and that the valour of the Roman people was notdeteriorated after the laws were equalized."" After he uttered thesewords among the battalions of the infantry, he flies from them to thecavalry. ""Come, young men, surpass in valour the infantry, as youalready surpass them in honour and in rank. The infantry at the firstonset have made the enemy give way: now that they have given way, do yougive reins to your horses and drive them from the field. They will notstand your charge: even now they rather hesitate than resist."" They spuron their horses, and drive in amongst the enemy who were already throwninto confusion by the attack of the infantry; and having broken throughthe ranks, and pushed on to the rear of their line, a part wheelinground in the open space, turn most of them away from the camp to whichthey were now flying from all sides, and by riding on before they deterthem from that direction. The line of infantry, and the consul himself,and the main body of the army make for the camp, and having taken itwith considerable slaughter, they get possession of a great quantity ofbooty. The fame of this battle was carried not only to the city, but tothe other army also among the Sabines. In the city it was celebratedonly with public rejoicing; in the camp it fired the courage of thesoldiers to emulate such glory. Horatius, by training them inexcursions, and making trial of them in slight skirmishes, hadaccustomed them to trust in themselves rather than to remember theignominy incurred under the command of the decemvirs, and these littleencounters had now gone so far as to insure to them the consummation ofall their hopes. The Sabines, elated at their success on the precedingyear, ceased not to provoke and urge them (to fight,) constantly askingthem why they wasted time, sallying forth in small numbers and returninglike marauders, and why they parcelled out the grand effort of a singlewar on a number of insignificant skirmishes? why did they not engagethem in the field, and consign the result to fortune to be determined atonce?"Book 3,Chapter 62,"Besides that they had already of themselves recovered a sufficientdegree of courage, the Romans were fired with exasperation ""that theother army would soon return victorious to the city; that the enemy werenow wantonly insulting them by contumelies; when would they be a matchfor the enemy, if they were not so then?"" When the consul ascertainedthat the soldiers gave expression to these sentiments in the camp,having summoned an assembly: ""How matters have gone on in Algidum,"" sayshe, ""I suppose that you, soldiers, have already heard. As became thearmy of a free people to behave, so have they behaved: through thejudicious conduct of my colleague and the valour of the soldiers, thevictory has been gained. For my part, the plan and determination which Iam to maintain, you yourselves shall suggest. The war may be bothprolonged with advantage, and be brought to a speedy conclusion. If itis to be prolonged, I shall take care by the same discipline with whichI have commenced, that your hopes and your valour may increase everyday. If you have now sufficient courage, and it is your wish that thematter be decided, come on, raise here that shout such as you will raisein the field of battle, the index at once of your inclination and yourvalour."" When the shout was raised with great alacrity, he assures them""that with the good favour of heaven, he would comply with their wishesand lead them next day to the field."" The remainder of the day is spentin preparing their arms. On the following day, as soon as the Sabinessaw the Roman army being drawn up in order of battle, they too, as beinglong since eager for the encounter, come forward. The battle was such aone as may be expected between two armies confident in themselves, theone animated by the glory of former and uninterrupted glory, the otherlately so by an unusual instance of success. The Sabines aided theirstrength by stratagem also; for having formed a line equal (to that ofthe enemy,) they kept two thousand men in reserve, to make an attack onthe left wing of the Romans in the heat of the battle. When these, by anattack in flank, were overpowering that wing, now almost surrounded,about six hundred of the cavalry of two legions leap down from theirhorses, and rush forward in front of their men, now giving way; and theyat the same time both oppose the progress of the enemy, and incite thecourage of the infantry, first sharing the danger equally with them, andthen by arousing in them a sense of shame. It was a matter of shame thatthe cavalry should fight in their own proper character and in that ofothers; and that the infantry should not be equal to the cavalry evenwhen dismounted."Book 3,Chapter 63,"They press forward therefore to the fight, which had been suspendedon their part, and endeavour to regain the ground which they had lost,and in a moment not only is the battle restored, but one of the wings ofthe Sabines gives way. The cavalry, covered between the ranks of thefoot, return to their horses; they then gallop across to the otherdivision to announce their success to their party; at the same time alsothey make a charge on the enemy, now disheartened by the discomfiture oftheir stronger wing. The valour of none shone more conspicuous in thatbattle. The consul provided for all emergencies; he applauded the brave,rebuked wherever the battle seemed to slacken. When reproved, theydisplayed immediately the energy of brave men; and a sense of shamestimulated them as much as praises excited the others. The shout beingraised anew, and making a united effort, they drive the enemy back; norcould the Roman power be any longer resisted. The Sabines, driven inevery direction through the country, leave behind them their camp asplunder for the enemy. There the Roman recovers the effects not of theallies, as at Algidum, but his own property, which had been lost by thedevastations of their lands. For this double victory, obtained in twobattles, in two different places, the senate through jealousy decreedmerely supplications in the name of the consuls for one day only. Thepeople went, however, on the second day also in great numbers of theirown accord to offer thanksgiving; and this unauthorized and popularsupplication was even more zealously attended. The consuls by concertcame to the city within the same two days, and called out the senate tothe Campus Martius. Where, when they were relating the servicesperformed by themselves, the chiefs of the patricians complained thatthe senate was convened among the soldiers designedly for the purpose ofintimidation. The consuls therefore, lest there might be any foundationfor such a charge, called away the senate to the Flaminian meadows,where the temple of Apollo now is (even then they called itApollinaris). Where, when a triumph was refused by a large majority ofthe patricians, Lucius Icilius, tribune of the commons, proposed to thepeople regarding the triumph of the consuls, many persons coming forwardto argue against the measure, but in particular Caius Claudius,exclaiming, ""That it was over the senate, not over the enemy, theconsuls wished to triumph; and that it was intended as a return for aprivate service to a tribune, and not as an honour due to valour. Thatnever before was the matter of a triumph managed through the people; butthat the consideration concerning the honour and the disposal of it,always lay with the senate; that not even the kings had infringed on themajesty of this highest order. That the tribunes should not thus occupyevery department with their own authority, so as to allow the existenceof no public council; that the state would be free, and the lawsequalized by these means only, if each rank would retain its own rights,its own dignity."" Though much had been said by the other seniorpatricians also to the same purpose, all the tribes approved thatproposition. Then for the first time a triumph was celebrated by orderof the people, without the authority of the senate."Book 3,Chapter 64,"This victory of the tribunes and people was well nigh terminating inan extravagance of a by no means salutary tendency, a conspiracy beingformed among the tribunes to have the same tribunes re-elected, and inorder that their ambition might be the less conspicuous, to continuetheir office to the consuls. They pleaded, as a cause, the combinationof the patricians by which the privileges of the commons were attemptedto be undermined by the affronts thrown upon the consuls. What would bethe consequence, before the laws are yet firmly established, if consulsshould through their factions attack the new tribunes. For that Horatiiand Valerii would not always be consuls, who would postpone their owninterest to the liberty of the people. By some concurrence ofcircumstances, useful at the time, it fell by lot to Marcus Duiliusabove any one else to preside at the elections, a man of prudence, andwho perceived the storm of public odium that was hanging over them fromthe continuance of their office. And when he stated that he would takeno notice of the former tribunes, and his colleagues strenuouslyinsisted that he should allow the tribes to be at liberty to vote, orshould give up the office of presiding at the elections to hiscolleagues, who would hold the election according to law rather thanaccording to the pleasure of the patricians; a contention being nowexcited, when Duilius had sent for the consuls to his seat and askedthem what they contemplated doing with respect to the consularelections, and they answered that they would appoint new consuls, havingfound popular supporters of a measure by no means popular, he proceededwith them into the assembly. Where, when the consuls, being broughtforward before the people, and asked, whether if the Roman people,mindful of their liberty recovered at home through them, mindful also oftheir military services, should again elect them consuls, what theywould do, made no change in their sentiments; he held the election,after eulogizing the consuls, because they persevered to the last inbeing unlike the decemvirs; and five tribunes of the people beingelected, when, through the zealous exertions of the nine tribunes whoopenly pushed their canvass, the other candidates could not make up therequired number of tribes, he dismissed the assembly; nor did he holdone after for the purpose of an election. He said that he had fulfilledthe law, which without any where specifying the number of tribunes, onlyenacted that tribunes should be left; and recommended that colleagues bechosen by those who had been elected. And he recited the terms of thelaw, in which (it is said,) ""If I shall propose ten tribunes of thecommons, if you elect this day less than ten tribunes of the people,then that those whom they may have chosen as colleagues for themselvesbe legitimate tribunes of the people, by the same law as those whom youhave this day elected tribunes of the people."" When Duilius perseveredto the last, stating that the republic could not have fifteen tribunesof the people, after baffling the ambition of his colleagues, heresigned his office, being equally approved by the patricians andpeople."Book 3,Chapter 65,"The new tribunes of the people in electing their colleagues evinceda disposition to gratify the wishes of the patricians; they even electedtwo who were patricians, and even consulars, Spurius Tarpeius and AulusAterius. The consuls then elected, Largius Herminius, Titus VirginiusC¾limontanus not very much inclined to the cause either of thepatricians or commons, had perfect tranquillity both at home and abroad.Lucius Trebonius, tribune of the commons, incensed against thepatricians, because, as he said, he was imposed on by them in the affairof choosing colleagues, and betrayed by his colleagues, carried aproposal, ""that whoever took the votes of the commons in electingtribunes of the people, he should go on taking the votes, until heelected ten tribunes of the people;"" and he spent his tribuneship inworrying the patricians, whence the cognomen of Asper was given him.Next Marcus Geganius Macerinus, and Caius Julius, being elected consuls,quieted some combinations of the tribunes against the youth of thenobility, without any harsh proceeding against that power, and stillpreserving the dignity of the patricians; by proclaiming a levy for thewar against the Volscians and ®quans, they kept the people from riots bykeeping matters in abeyance; affirming, that every thing was quietabroad, there being harmony in the city, and that through civil discordthe enemies assumed new courage. Their anxiety for peace was also thecause of concord at home. But each of the orders ever took advantage ofmoderation in the other. Acts of injustice began to be committed by theyounger patricians on the commons when perfectly quiet. When thetribunes would assist the weaker party, at first it was of little use;then not even themselves escaped being ill-treated; particularly in thelatter months, when injustice was committed through the combinationsamong the more powerful, and the vigour of every magistracy becomesconsiderably more lax in the latter part of the year; and now thecommons placed hopes in the tribuneship, only on the condition that theyhad tribunes like Icilius; that for the last two years they had had onlymere names. On the other hand, the elder members of the patrician order,though they considered their young men to be too overbearing, yet wouldrather, if bounds were to be exceeded, that a redundancy of spiritshould exist in their own order than in their adversaries. So difficulta thing is moderation in maintaining liberty, whilst by pretending todesire equalization, every person raises himself in such a manner as todepress another; and men, by their very precautions against fear, causethemselves to become objects of dread; and we saddle on others injusticethrown off from ourselves, as if it were actually necessary either tocommit injustice or to submit to it."Book 3,Chapter 66,"Titus Quintius Capitolinus, for the fourth time, and Agrippa Furiusbeing then elected consuls, found neither disturbance at home nor warabroad; both, however, were impending. The discord of the citizens couldnow no longer be checked, both tribunes and commons being exasperatedagainst the patricians, when a day of trial being appointed for any ofthe nobility always embroiled the assemblies with new contests. On thefirst noise of which the ®quans and Volscians, as if they had received asignal, took up arms; at the same time because their leaders, desirousof plunder, had persuaded them that the levy proclaimed two yearspreviously could not be proceeded with, the commons now refusingobedience; that on that account no armies were sent against them; thatmilitary discipline was subverted by licentiousness; and that Rome wasno longer considered as their common country; that whatever resentmentand animosity they may have entertained against foreigners, was nowturned against each other; that now an occasion offered for destroyingthose wolves blinded by intestine rage. Having united their forces, theyfirst laid waste the Latin territory: when no resistance was foundthere, then indeed, to the great exultation of the advisers of the war,they approached the very walls of Rome, carrying their depredations intothe district around the Esquiline gate, pointing out to the city thedevastation of the land by way of insult. Whence when they marched backto Corbio unmolested, and driving the prey before them, Quintius theconsul summoned the people to an assembly."Book 3,Chapter 67,"There I find that he spoke to this purport: ""Though I am consciousto myself of no fault, Romans, yet with the greatest shame I have comeforward to your assembly. That you should know this; that this should behanded down on record to posterity, that the ®quans and Volscians, ashort time since scarcely a match for the Hernicians, have with impunitycome with arms in their hands to the walls of Rome, in the fourthconsulate of Titus Quintius. Had I known that this ignominy was reservedfor this particular year, (though we are now long living in such amanner, such is the state of affairs, that my mind could augur nothinggood,) I would have avoided this honour either by exile or by death, ifthere were no other means of escaping it. Then if men of courage hadthose arms, which were at our gates, could Rome be taken in myconsulate? I have had sufficient honours, enough and more than enough oflife: I should have died in my third consulate. Whom did these mostdastardly enemies despise? us, consuls, or you, citizens? If the faultis in us, take away the command from us as unworthy persons; and if thatis insufficient, further inflict punishment on us. If in you, may therebe none of gods or men who will punish your offences; do you only repentof them. It is not your cowardice they have despised, nor their ownvalour they have confided in; for having been so often routed and put toflight, stripped of their camp, amerced in their land, sent under theyoke, they know both themselves and you. The discord among the severalorders is the bane of this city; the contests of the patricians andcommons have raised their spirits; whilst we have neither bounds in thepursuit of power, nor you in that of liberty, whilst you are tired ofpatrician, these of plebeian magistrates. In the name of heaven, whatwould ye have? You coveted tribunes of the commons; we conceded them forthe sake of concord. Ye longed for decemvirs; we suffered them to becreated. Ye became weary of decemvirs; we compelled them to resign theoffice. Your resentment against these same persons when they becameprivate citizens still continuing, we suffered men of the highestfamilies and rank to die or go into exile. Ye wished again to createtribunes of the commons; ye created them. Though we saw that it wasunjust to the patricians to create consuls in your own interest, we haveeven seen a patrician magistracy conceded as an offering to the people.The aid of tribunes, right of appeal to the people, the acts of thecommons made binding on the patricians under the pretext of equalizingthe laws, the subversion of our privileges, we have borne and stillbear. What termination is there to be to our dissensions? when shall itbe allowed us to have a united city? when to have one common country?When defeated we submit with more resignation than you when victorious.Is it enough for you, that you are objects of terror to us? The Aventineis taken against us; against us the Sacred mount is seized. When theEsquili¾ is almost taken by the enemy, and when the Volscian foe isscaling your rampart, there is no one to dislodge him: against us yeare men, against us ye take up arms."Book 3,Chapter 68,"""Come, when ye have blockaded the senate-house here, and have madethe forum the seat of war, and filled the prison with the leading men ofthe state, march forth through the Esquiline gate, with that samedetermined spirit; or if ye do not even venture thus far, behold fromyour walls the lands laid waste with fire and sword, booty driven off,the houses set on fire in every direction and smoking. But (I may betold) it is the public weal that is in a worse condition through theseresults: the land is burned, the city is besieged, all the glory of thewar is centred in the enemy. What in the name of heaven? in what stateis your own private interest? just now his own private losses wereannounced to each of you from the lands. What, pray, is there at home,whence you may recruit them? Will the tribunes restore and compensateyou for what ye have lost? Of sound and words they will heap on you asmuch as ye please, and of charges against the leading men, and laws oneupon another, and of public meetings. But from these meetings never hasone of you returned home more increased in substance or in fortune. Hasany one ever brought back to his wife and children aught save hatred,quarrels, grudges public and private? from which (and their effects) youhave been ever protected, not by your own valour and integrity, but bythe aid of others. But, when you served under the guidance of usconsuls, not under your tribunes, and the enemy trembled at your shoutin the field of battle, not the Roman patricians in the assembly, bootybeing obtained, land taken from the enemy, with a plentiful stock ofwealth and glory, both public and private, you used to return home toyour household gods in triumph: now you allow the enemy to go off ladenwith your property. Continue immovably tied to your assemblies, live inthe forum; the necessity of taking the field, which ye avoid, stillfollows you. Was it too hard on you to march against the ®quans and theVolscians? The war is at your gates: if it is not repelled from thence,it will soon be within your walls, and will scale the citadel andCapitol, and follow you into your very houses. Two years ago the senateordered a levy to be held, and the army to march to Algidum; yet we sitdown listless at home, quarrelling with each other like women;delighting in present peace, and not seeing that after that short-livedintermission complicated wars are sure to return. That there are othertopics more pleasing than these, I well know; but even though my ownmind did not prompt me to it, necessity obliges me to speak that whichis true instead of that which is pleasing. I would indeed be anxious toplease you, Romans; but I am much more anxious that ye should bepreserved, whatever sentiments ye shall entertain towards me. It hasbeen so ordained by nature, that he who addresses a multitude for hisown private interest, is more pleasing than the man whose mind hasnothing in view but the public interest. Unless perhaps you suppose thatthose public sycophants, those flatterers of the commons, who neithersuffer you to take up arms nor to live in peace, incite and work you upfor your own interests. When excited, you are to them sources either ofhonour or of profit: and because, during concord between the severalorders, they see that themselves are of no importance on any side, theywish to be leaders of a bad cause rather than of no cause whatever, oftumults, and of sedition. Of which state of things, if a tedium can atlength enter your minds, and if ye are willing to resume the modes ofacting practised by your forefathers, and formerly by yourselves, Isubmit to any punishment, if I do not rout and put to flight, and stripof their camp, those ravagers of our lands, and transfer from our gatesand walls to their cities this terror of war, by which you are nowthrown into consternation."""Book 3,Chapter 69,"Scarcely ever was the speech of a popular tribune more acceptable tothe commons, than was this of a most strict consul on that occasion. Theyoung men also, who during such alarming emergencies had been accustomedto employ the refusal to enlist as the sharpest weapon against thepatricians, began to direct their thoughts to war and arms: and theflight of the rustics, and those who had been robbed on the lands andwounded, announcing matters more revolting even than what was exhibitedto view, filled the whole city with a spirit of vengeance. When thesenate assembled, these all turning to Quintius, looked on him as theonly champion of Roman majesty; and the leading senators declared ""hisharangue to be worthy of the consular authority, worthy of so manyconsulships formerly borne by him, worthy of his whole life, which wasfull of honours frequently enjoyed, more frequently deserved. Thatother consuls had either flattered the commons by betraying the dignityof the patricians, or by harshly maintaining the rights of their order,had rendered the multitude more difficult to subdue: that Titus Quintiushad delivered a speech mindful of the dignity of the patricians, of theconcord of the different orders, and above all, of the times. Theyentreated him and his colleague to take up the interest of thecommonwealth; they entreated the tribunes, that by acting in concertwith the consuls they would join in repelling the war from the city andthe walls, and that they would induce the commons to be obedient to thesenate in so perilous a conjuncture: that, their lands being devastated,and their city in a manner besieged, their common country appealed tothem as tribunes, and implored their aid."" By universal consent the levyis decreed and held. When the consuls gave public notice ""that there wasno time for examining into excuses, that all the young men should attendon the following morning at the first dawn in the Campus Martius; thatwhen the war was over, they should afford time for inquiring into theexcuses of those who had not given in their names; that the man shouldbe held as a deserter, with whose excuse they might not be satisfied;""the entire youth attended on the following day. The cohorts chose eachtheir centurions: two senators were placed at the head of each cohort.We have heard that all these measures were perfected with suchexpedition, that the standards, having been brought forth from thetreasury on that very day by the qu¾stors and conveyed to the Campus,began to move from thence at the fourth hour; and the newly raised armyhalted at the tenth stone, followed by a few cohorts of veteran soldiersas volunteers. The following day brought the enemy within view, and campwas joined to camp near Corbio. On the third day, when resentment urgedon the Romans, a consciousness of guilt for having so often rebelled,and despair (of pardon) urged them on the other side, there was no delaymade in coming to an engagement."Book 3,Chapter 70,"In the Roman army, though the two consuls were invested with equalauthority, the supreme command was by the concession of Agrippa resignedto his colleague, a thing which is most salutary in the management ofmatters of great importance; and he who was preferred politelyresponded to the ready condescension of him who lowered himself, bycommunicating to him all his measures and sharing with him his honours,and by equalizing himself to him no longer his equal. On the field ofbattle Quintius commanded the right, Agrippa the left wing; the commandof the central line is intrusted to Spurius Postumius Albus, aslieutenant-general. Servius Sulpicius, the other lieutenant-general,they place over the cavalry. The infantry on the right wing fought withdistinguished valour, with stout resistance from the Volscians. ServiusSulpicius broke with his cavalry through the centre of the enemy's line;whence though he might have returned in the same way to his own party,before the enemy could have restored their broken ranks, it seemed moreadvisable to attack the enemy's rear, and by attacking the rear he wouldin a moment have dispersed the enemy by the twofold attack, had not thecavalry of the Volscians and ®quans intercepted him and kept him engagedby a mode of fighting similar to his own. Then indeed Sulpicius assertedthat ""there was no time for delaying,"" crying out that ""they weresurrounded and cut off from their own friends, unless they united alltheir efforts and despatched the engagement with the cavalry. Nor was itenough to rout the enemy without disabling them; that they should slayhorses and men, lest any might return to the fight or renew the battle;that they could not resist them, before whom a compact body of infantryhad given way."" His orders were addressed to by no means deaf ears; byone charge they routed the entire cavalry, dismounted great numbers, andkilled with their javelins both the men and the horses. This put atermination to the battle with the cavalry. Then attacking the enemy'sline, they send an account to the consuls of what they had done, wherethe enemy's line was now giving way. The news both gave new spirits tothe Romans who were now conquering, and dismayed the ®quans as they werebeginning to give way. They first began to be beaten in the centre,where the charge of the cavalry had broken their ranks. Then the leftwing began to lose ground before the consul Quintius; there was mostdifficulty on the right. Then Agrippa, buoyed up by youth and vigour, onseeing matters going more favourably in every part of the battle than inhis own quarter, took some of the standards from the standard-bearersand carried them on himself, some even he began to throw into the thickof the enemy. The soldiers, urged on by the fear of this disgrace,attacked the enemy; thus the victory was equalized in every quarter.News then came from Quintius that he, being now victorious, was about toattack the enemy's camp; that he was unwilling to break into it beforehe learned that they were beaten in the left wing also. If he had routedthe enemy, that he should now join him, that all the army together mighttake possession of the booty. Agrippa being victorious came with mutualcongratulations to his victorious colleague and to the enemy's camp.There being but few to defend it, and these being routed in a moment,they break into the fortifications without a struggle; and they marchback the army after it obtained a large share of spoil, having recoveredalso their own effects, which had been lost by the devastation of thelands. I have not ascertained that either they themselves demanded atriumph, nor that such was conferred on them by the senate; nor is anycause assigned for the honour being either overlooked or not hoped for.As far as I can conjecture at so great a distance of time, when atriumph had been refused to the consuls Horatius and Valerius, who, inaddition to the ®quans and Volscians, had gained the glory of finishingthe Sabine war, the consuls were ashamed to demand a triumph for onehalf of the services done by them; lest if they even should obtain it,regard of persons rather than of merit might appear to have beenentertained."Book 3,Chapter 71,"A disgraceful decision of the people regarding the boundaries oftheir allies disgraced the honourable victory obtained over theirenemies. The states of Aricia and of Ardea, having frequently contendedin arms concerning a disputed piece of land, and being wearied out bymany mutual losses, appointed the Roman people as arbitrators. When theycame to support their claims, an assembly of the people being grantedthem by the magistrates, a debate ensued conducted with great warmth.And the witnesses being now produced, when the tribes were to be called,and the people were to give their votes, Publius Scaptius, a plebeianadvanced in years, rises up and says; ""Consuls, if it is permitted me tospeak on the public interest, I will not suffer the people to be ledinto a mistake in this matter."" When the consuls said that he, asunworthy of attention, was not to be heard and, on his exclaiming ""thatthe public interest was being betrayed,"" ordered him to be put aside, heappeals to the tribunes. The tribunes, as they are always directed bythe multitude, rather than they direct them, indulged the people, whowere anxious to hear him, in granting Scaptius leave to say what hepleased. He then commences: ""That he was in his eighty-third year, andthat he had served in that district which was now in dispute, not eventhen a young man as he was serving his twentieth campaign, whenoperations were going on at Corioli. He therefore adduced a factforgotten by length of time, but one deeply fixed in his own memory: thedistrict now in dispute had belonged to the territory of Corioli, andafter the taking of Corioli, it became by right of war the publicproperty of the Roman people. That he was surprised how the states ofArdea and Aricia should hope to intercept from the Roman people, whomfrom being the right owners they made arbitrators, a district the rightto which they never claimed whilst the state of Corioli subsisted. Thathe for his part had but a short time to live; he could not however bringhimself, old as he now was, to decline claiming by his voice, the onlymeans he now had, a district which, as a soldier, he had contributed toacquire, as far as an individual could. That he strenuously advised thepeople not to damn their own interest by an improper feeling ofdelicacy."""Book 3,Chapter 72,"The consuls, when they perceived that Scaptius was listened to notonly in silence, but even with approbation, appealing to gods and men,that an enormous and disgraceful act was being committed, send for theprincipal senators: with these they went around to the tribunes;entreated, ""that, as judges, they would not be guilty of a most heinouscrime, with a still worse precedent, by converting the dispute to theirown interest, more especially when, even though it may be lawful for ajudge to protect his own emolument, so much would by no means beacquired by keeping the land, as would be lost by alienating theaffections of their allies by injustice; for that the losses ofcharacter and of reputation were greater than could be estimated. Werethe ambassadors to carry home this answer; was this to go out to theworld; were their allies to hear this; were their enemies to hearit--with what sorrow the one--with what joy the other party? Could theysuppose, that the neighbouring states would impute this proceeding toScaptius, an old babbler at assemblies? that Scaptius would be rendereddistinguished by this statue: that the Roman people would assume thecharacter of a usurper and intercepter of the claims of others. For whatjudge in a private cause ever acted in this way, so as to adjudge tohimself the property in dispute? That even Scaptius himself would notact so, though he has now outlived all sense of shame."" Thus theconsuls, thus the senators exclaimed; but covetousness, and Scaptius,the adviser of that covetousness, had more influence. The tribes, whenconvened, decided that the district was the public property of the Romanpeople. Nor is it denied that it might have been so, if they had gone toother judges; now the disgrace of the decision is certainly not at alldiminished by the fairness of the title: nor did it appear moredisgraceful or more hideous to the people of Aricia and of Ardea, thanit did to the Roman senate. The remainder of the year continued freefrom either city or foreign commotions."Book 4,Chapter 1,"Marcus Genucius and Caius Curtius followed these as consuls. The yearwas disturbed both at home and abroad. For at the commencement of theyear Caius Canuleius, tribune of the people, proposed a law concerningthe intermarriage of the patricians and commons; by which the patriciansconsidered that their blood would be contaminated, and the privileges ofbirth would be confounded; and a hint at first lightly suggested by thetribunes, that it should be lawful that one of the consuls should beelected from the commons, afterwards proceeded so far, that the ninetribunes proposed a bill, ""that the people should have the power ofelecting the consuls, whether they wished, from the commons or thepatricians. But they thought that if that were done, the supremeauthority would not only be shared with the lowest ranks, but be whollytransferred from the nobility to the commons. With joy therefore thepatricians heard that the people of Ardea had revolted in consequence ofthe injustice of the taking away their land, and that the Veientians hadlaid waste the frontiers of the Roman territory, and that the Volsciansand ®quans murmured on account of the fortifying of Verrago; so much didthey prefer an unsuccessful war to an ignominious peace."" These tidingstherefore being received and with exaggerations, in order that duringthe din of so many wars the tribunitian proceedings might be suspended,they order the levies to be held, preparations to be made for war andarms with the utmost activity; with more energy, if possible, than hadbeen used in the consulship of Titus Quintius. Then Caius Canuleiusdeclared aloud in brief terms in the senate, that ""the consuls wished invain to divert the commons from attention to the new laws; that theynever should hold a levee while he lived, before the commons had firstratified the laws proposed by him and his colleagues;"" and he instantlysummoned them to an assembly."Book 4,Chapter 2,"Both the consuls incited the senate against the tribune, and thetribune the people against the consuls at one and the same time. Theconsuls denied ""that tribunitian frenzies could any longer be endured;that they were now come to a crisis; that more hostilities were beingstirred up at home than abroad. That this happened not more through thefault of the commons than of the patricians; nor more through that ofthe tribunes than of the consuls. That the matter for which there was areward in the state thrived always with the greatest proficiency; thatthus it was that men became meritorious in peace, thus in war. That atRome the highest reward was for sedition; that had ever been the sourceof honour both to individuals and to collective bodies. They shouldremember in what condition they had received the majesty of the senatefrom their forefathers, in what condition they were about to transmit itto their children; that, like the commons, they should have it in theirpower to boast that it was improved in degree and in splendour. Thatthere was no end, nor would there be, so long as the promoters ofsedition were rewarded with honour in proportion as sedition wassuccessful. What and how important schemes Caius Canuleius had set onfoot! that he was introducing confounding of family rank, a disturbanceof the auspices both public and private, that nothing may remain pure,nothing uncontaminated; that, all distinction being abolished, no onemight know either himself or those he belonged to. For what othertendency had those promiscuous intermarriages, except that intercoursebetween commons and patricians might be made common after the manner ofwild beasts; so that of the offspring each may be ignorant of what bloodhe may be, of what form of religion he was; that he may belong half tothe patricians, half to the commons, not being homogeneous even withhimself? That it appeared not enough, that all things divine and humanshould be confounded; that those disturbers of the common people werenow preparing to (seize) the consulship; and first that they soundedpeople's sentiments in mere conversation on the project of having oneconsul appointed from the commons; that now the proposition was broughtforward, that the people may appoint the consuls, whether they pleasedfrom the patricians or from the people; and that they would appoint nodoubt every most turbulent person. The Canuleii, therefore, and theIcilii would be consuls. (They expressed a hope) that Jupiter, the bestand greatest, would not suffer the imperial majesty of the sovereignpower to descend to that; and that they would certainly die a thousanddeaths rather than such a disgrace should be incurred. They were certainthat their ancestors, could they have divined that the commons wouldbecome not more placable to them, but more intractable, by makingsuccessive demands still more unreasonable, after they had obtained thefirst, would have rather submitted to any struggle, than have sufferedsuch laws to be saddled on them. Because it was then conceded to themwith respect to tribunes, the concession was made a second time. Therewas no end to it; tribunes of the commons and patricians could notsubsist in the same state; either the one order or the other office mustbe abolished; and that a stop should be put to presumption and temerityrather late than never. (Was it right) that they, by sowing discord,should with impunity stir up the neighbouring states against us? andthen prevent the state from arming and defending itself against thoseevils which they may have brought on us? and after they have almost sentfor the enemy, not suffer the armies to be levied against the enemies?But Canuleius may have the audacity to declare openly in the senatethat, unless the patrician suffer the laws proposed by himself asvictorious, to be enacted, he would prevent the levy from being held.What else was this, but threatening that he would betray his country;that he would suffer it to be attacked and captured? What courage wouldthat expression afford, not to the Roman commons, but to the Volscians,®quans, and the Veientians! would they not hope that, under thegeneralship of Canuleius, they should be able to scale the Capitol andcitadel, if with the deprivation of privilege and majesty, the tribunesshould rob the patricians of their courage also? That the consuls wereprepared to act against the wicked schemes of their countrymen, beforethey would act against the arms of the enemy."""Book 4,Chapter 3,"Just when these matters were going on in the senate, Canuleius thusdeclaimed in favour of his laws and against the consuls: ""Frequentlyeven before now I think I have observed how much the patricians despisedyou, Romans, how unworthy they deemed you to dwell in the one city andwithin the same walls with them; but on the present occasion mostclearly, in their having risen up so determinedly in opposition to thosepropositions of ours: in which what else do we do, but remind them thatwe are their fellow citizens, and that though we possess not the samepower, we inhabit the same city? In the one we demand intermarriage, athing which is usually granted to neighbours and foreigners: we havegranted even to vanquished enemies the right of citizenship, which ismore than the right of intermarriage. In the other we propose nothingnew; we only reclaim and demand that which is the people's; that theRoman people may confer honours on whomsoever they may please. And whatin the name of goodness is it for which they embroil heaven and earth?why was almost an attack made on me just now in the senate? why do theysay that they will not restrain themselves from violence, and threatenthat they will insult an office, sacred and inviolable? Shall this cityno longer be able to stand, and is the empire at stake, if the right offree suffrage is granted to the Roman people, to confer the consulshipon whomsoever they may please, and if a plebeian, though he may beworthy of the highest honour, is not precluded from the hope ofattaining that honour? and is this of the same import, whether aplebeian be made a consul, as if any one were to propose a slave or theson of a slave to be consul? Do you perceive in what contempt you live?they would take from you a participation in this light, if it werepermitted them. That you breathe, that you enjoy the faculty of speech,that you possess the forms of human beings, excites their indignation.Nay even, as I hope for mercy, they say that it is contrary to religionthat a plebeian should be made consul. I pray, though we are notadmitted to the annals, nor to the commentaries of the pontiffs, do wenot know even those things which strangers know? that consuls havesucceeded kings? and that they possess no privilege, no majesty whichwas not formerly inherent in kings? Do you suppose that we ever heard itmentioned that Numa Pompilius, who not only was not a patrician, but noteven a citizen of Rome, was sent for from the country of the Sabines byorder of the people, with the approbation of the senate, and that he wasmade king at Rome? that afterwards Lucius Tarquinius, who was not onlynot of Roman, but not even of Italian extraction, the son of Damaratusof Corinth, an emigrant from Tarquinii, was made king, even whilst thesons of Ancus still lived? that after him Servius Tullius, the son of acaptive woman of Corniculum, with his father unknown, his mother aslave, attained the throne by his ability and merit? For what shall Isay of Titus Tatius the Sabine, whom Romulus himself, the founder of ourcity, admitted into partnership of the throne? Accordingly, whilst noclass of persons is disdained, in whom conspicuous merit may be found,the Roman dominion increased. You do well to be dissatisfied now with aplebeian consul, when your ancestors disdained not foreigners as kings,and when, even after the expulsion of kings, the city was not shutagainst foreign merit. After the expulsion of the kings, we certainlyadmitted the Claudian family from the Sabine country not only intocitizenship, but even into the number of the patricians. Can a man froma foreigner be made a patrician, then a consul? shall a Roman citizen,if he belong to the commons, be precluded from all hope of theconsulate? Do we then deem it impossible that a man of the commons canbe a person of fortitude and activity, qualified to excel both in peaceand war, tyke to Numa, Lucius Tarquinius, and Servius Tullius? Or,should such appear, shall we not suffer him to meddle with the helm ofgovernment? or shall we have consuls like the decemvirs, the mostabandoned of mortals, who were, however, all patricians, rather thanlike the best of kings, though new men?"Book 4,Chapter 4,"""But (I may be told) no commoner has been consul since the expulsionof the kings. What then? ought no innovation to be introduced? and whathas not yet been practised, (and in a new state there are many thingsnot yet practised,) ought not even such measures, even though they beuseful, be adopted? During the reign of Romulus there were no pontiffs,nor augurs: they were appointed by Numa Pompilius. There was no censusin the state, nor the distribution of centuries and classes; it wasintroduced by Servius Tullius: there never had been consuls; they werecreated after the expulsion of the kings. Of a dictator neither theoffice nor the name had existed; it commenced its existence among thesenators. There were no tribunes of the people, ¾diles, nor qu¾stors: itwas resolved that those officers should be appointed. Within the lastten years we both created decemvirs for compiling laws, and we abolishedthem. Who can doubt but that in a city doomed for eternal duration,increasing to an immense magnitude, new civil offices, priesthoods,rights of families and of individuals, may be established? This verymatter, that there should not be the right of intermarriage betweenpatricians and commons, did not the decemvirs introduce within the lastfew years to the utmost injury of the commons, on a principle mostdetrimental to the public? Can there be a greater or more marked insult,than that one portion of the state, as if contaminated, should be deemedunworthy of intermarriage? What else is it than to suffer exile withinthe same walls, actual rustication? They wish to prevent our being mixedwith them by affinity or consanguinity; that our blood be not mingledwith theirs. What? if this cast a stain on that nobility of yours, whichmost of you, the progeny of Albans or Sabines, possess, not in right ofbirth or blood, but by co-optation into the patricians, having beenelected either by the kings, or after the expulsion of kings, by orderof the people, could ye not keep it pure by private regulations, byneither marrying into the commons, and by not suffering your daughtersor sisters to marry out of the patricians. No one of the commons wouldoffer violence to a patrician maiden; such lust as that belongs to thepatricians. None of them would oblige any man against his will to enterinto a marriage contract. But really that such a thing should beprevented by law, that the intermarriage of the patricians and plebeiansshould be interdicted, that it is which is insulting to the commons. Whydo you not combine in enacting a law that there shall be nointermarriage between rich and poor? That which has in all places andalways been the business of private regulations, that a woman mightmarry into whatever family she has been engaged to, and that each manmight take a wife out of whatever family he had contracted with, that yeshackle with the restraints of a most tyrannical law, by which ye severthe bonds of civil society and split one state into two. Why do ye notenact a law that a plebeian shall not dwell in the neighbourhood of apatrician? that he shall not go the same road with him? that he shallnot enter the same banquet with him? that he shall not stand in the sameforum? For what else is there in the matter, if a patrician man wed aplebeian woman, or a plebeian a patrician? What right, pray, is therebychanged? the children surely go with the father. Nor is there any thingwhich we seek from intermarriage with you, except that we may be held inthe number of human beings and fellow citizens; nor is there any reasonwhy ye contest the point, except that it delights you to strive forinsult and ignominy to us."Book 4,Chapter 5,"""In a word, whether is the supreme power belonging to the Romanpeople, or is it yours? Whether by the expulsion of kings has dominionbeen acquired for you or equal liberty for all? It is fitting that theRoman people should be allowed to enact a law, if it please. Or will yedecree a levy by way of punishment, according as each bill shall beproposed? and as soon as I, as tribune, shall begin to call the tribesto give their votes, will you, forthwith, as consul, force the youngermen to take the military oath, and lead them out to camp? and will youthreaten the commons? will you threaten the tribune? What, if you hadnot already twice experienced how little those threats availed againstthe united sense of the people? Of course it was because you wished toconsult for our interest, that you abstained from force. Or was there nocontest for this reason, that the party which was the stronger was alsothe more moderate? Nor will there be any contest now, Romans: they willtry your spirit; your strength they will not make trial of. Wherefore,consuls, the commons are prepared to accompany you to these wars,whether real or fictitious, if, by restoring the right of intermarriage,you at length make this one state; if they can coalesce, be united andmixed with you by private ties; if the hope, if the access to honoursbe granted to men of ability and energy; if it is lawful to be in apartnership and share of the government; if, what is the result of equalfreedom, it be allowed in the distribution of the annual offices to obeyand to govern in their turns. If any one shall obstruct these measures,talk about wars, multiply them by report; no one will give in his name,no one will take up arms, no one will fight for haughty masters, withwhom there is no participation of honours in public, nor ofintermarriage in private."""Book 4,Chapter 6,"When both the consuls came forward into the assembly, and the matterhad changed from a long series of harangues to altercation, the tribune,on asking why it was not right that a plebeian should be made a consul,an answer was returned truly perhaps, though by no means expediently forthe present contest, ""that no plebeian could have the auspices, and forthis reason the decemvirs had prohibited the intermarriage, lest fromuncertainty of descent the auspices might be vitiated."" The commons werefired with indignation at this above all, because, as if hateful to theimmortal gods, they were denied to be qualified to take auspices. Andnow (as the commons both had a most energetic supporter in the tribune,and they themselves vied with him in perseverance) there was no end ofthe contentions, until the patricians, being at length overpowered,agreed that the law regarding intermarriage should be passed, judgingthat by these means most probably the tribunes would either give upaltogether or postpone till after the war the question concerning theplebeian consuls; and that in the mean time the commons, content withthe intermarriage-law (being passed,) would be ready to enlist. WhenCanuleius was now in high repute by his victory over the patricians andby the favour of the commons, the other tribunes being excited tocontend for their bill, set to work with all their might, and, theaccounts regarding the war augmenting daily, obstruct the levy. Theconsuls, when nothing could be transacted through the senate inconsequence of the opposition of the tribunes, held meetings of theleading men at their own houses. It was becoming evident that they mustconcede the victory either to the enemies or to their countrymen.Valerius and Horatius alone of the consulars did not attend themeetings. The opinion of Caius Claudius was for arming the consulsagainst the tribunes. The sentiments of the Quintii, both Cincinnatusand Capitolinus, were averse to bloodshed, and to violating (persons)whom by the treaty concluded with the commons they had admitted to besacred and inviolable. Through these meetings the matter was brought tothis, that they suffered tribunes of the soldiers with consularauthority to be elected from the patricians and commons withoutdistinction; that with respect to the election of consuls no changeshould be made; and with this the tribunes were content, as were alsothe commons. An assembly is now proclaimed for electing three tribuneswith consular power. This being proclaimed, forthwith whoever hadcontributed to promote sedition by word or deed, more particularly menwho had been tribunes, began to solicit support and to bustle about theforum as candidates; so that despair, in the first instance, ofobtaining the honour, by reason of the irritated state of the people'smind, then indignation at having to hold the office with such persons,deterred the patricians; at length however, being forced, they stood ascandidates, lest they might appear to have relinquished all share in thegovernment. The result of this election showed that the sentiments ofpersons in the struggle for liberty and dignity are different from thosethey feel when the contest is laid aside, the judgment being unbiassed;for the people elected all patricians as tribunes, content with this,that the plebeians had been taken into account. Where could you now findin an individual such moderation, disinterestedness, and elevation ofmind, as was then displayed by the entire people?"Book 4,Chapter 7,"In the three hundred and tenth year after the city of Rome was built,for the first time military tribunes in the room of consuls enter intooffice, Aulus Sempronius Atratinus, Lucius Atilius, Titus Cl¾lius; inwhose office the concord prevailing at home afforded peace also abroad.There are some who, without mentioning the proposal of the lawconcerning the election of consuls from among the commons, say thatthree military tribunes were elected on account of the Veientian warbeing added to the war of the ®quans and the Volscians and to the revoltof the Ardeates, because two consuls could not execute so many warstogether, these tribunes being invested also with the authority andinsignia of consuls. The jurisdiction of that office however did notstand on a firm footing, because the third month after they entered onthe office, they resigned the honour, in pursuance of a decree of theaugurs, as if unduly elected; because Caius Curtius, who had presided atthe election, had not selected his tent with due regard to ceremony.Ambassadors came to Rome from Ardea complaining of the injustice in sucha manner, that it appeared that, if it were redressed, they wouldcontinue in amity and the observance of the treaty, on the restitutionof their land. The answer returned by the senate was: ""that the judgmentof the people could not be rescinded by the senate, besides such ameasure could not be adopted on precedent or with justice;, as anadditional reason also for the purpose of preserving concord between theseveral orders of the state. If the Ardeans were willing to abide aseasonable conjuncture, and leave to the senate the mode of redressingthe injustice done to them, that the consequence would be that theywould rejoice for having moderated their resentment, and that theyshould be convinced that the patricians were equally anxious that noinjustice should arise against them, and that any which may have arisenshould not be lasting."" Thus the ambassadors, saying that they shouldlay the whole matter anew before their friends, were dismissedcourteously. The patricians, now that the republic was without anycurule magistrate, assembled together and elected an interrex. Thecontest whether consuls or military tribunes should be elected, kept thematter for several days in a state of interregnum. The interrex andsenate strive that the elections of consuls be held; the tribunes of thepeople, and the people themselves, that elections of the militarytribunes be held. The patricians succeeded, because both the commons,sure to confer the one or the other honour on patricians, gave up aneedless contest, and the leaders of the commons preferred thoseelections at which no account was to be taken of them (as candidates) tothose at which they should be passed by as unworthy. The tribunes of thecommons also gave up the contest without a decision, as a compliment tothe chiefs of the patricians. Titus Quintius Barbatus, the interrex,elects consuls Lucius Papirius Mugillanus, Lucius Sempronius Atratinus.During their consulship, the treaty was renewed with the Ardeans; andthat is a record to prove, that they were consuls in that year, thoughthey are not to be found among the ancient annals, nor in the books ofthe magistrates. I suppose because military tribunes existed at thecommencement of the year, on that account, though these consuls weresubstituted, the names of the consuls were left out, just as if themilitary tribunes were the entire year in office. Licinius Macer states,that they were found both in the Ardean treaty and in the linen books atthe temple of Moneta. There was tranquillity both at home and abroad,though so many alarms were held out by the neighbouring states."Book 4,Chapter 8,"This year (whether it had tribunes only, or consuls substituted inthe room of tribunes) is followed by a year when there were undoubtedlyconsuls, scil. Marcus Geganius Macerinus a second time, Titus QuintiusCapitolinus a fifth time. This same year was the commencement of thecensorship, a thing which arose from an humble origin, which afterwardsincreased so much in importance, that in it was vested the regulation ofthe morals and discipline of Rome, the senate and the centuries of theknights, the distinction of honour and of ignominy were under the swayof that office, the legal right to public and private places, therevenues of the Roman people fell under their beck and jurisdiction. Theinstitution of the thing originated in this, that the people not havingbeen subjected to a survey for several years, the census could neitherbe deferred, nor had the consuls leisure to discharge their duty, whenwars impended from so many states. An observation was made by thesenate, ""that an office laborious in itself, and one little suited tothe consular office, required a magistrate for itself, to whoseauthority should be submitted the duties of the several scribes, thecustody and care of the records, as well as the adjustment of the formto be adopted in the census."" And inconsiderable though the proposalmight be, still the senate received it with great pleasure, because itincreased the number of patrician magistrates in the state, judging alsothat that would come to pass, which really did occur, viz. that theinfluence of those who should preside, and the honour of the officewould derive on it additional authority and dignity. The tribunes also,considering the discharge of the duty (as was really the case) asnecessary rather than the duty itself, as being attended with lustre,did not indeed offer opposition, lest they should through perversenessshow a disposition to thwart them even in trifles. After the honour wasrejected by the leading men of the state, the people by their suffragesappointed to the office of conducting the census Papirius andSempronius, concerning whose consulate doubts are entertained, that inthat magistracy they might have some recompence for the incompletenessof their consulate. They were called censors from the nature of theiroffice."Book 4,Chapter 9,"Whilst these matters are transacting at Rome, ambassadors come fromArdea, imploring aid for their city, which was nearly destroyed, inconsideration of their very ancient alliance, and of the treaty recentlyrenewed. For by intestine wars they were not allowed to enjoy the peacewith Rome, which they had by the soundest policy preserved; the causeand origin of which is said to have arisen from a struggle betweenfactions; which have proved and ever will prove more a cause ofdestruction to several states, than foreign wars, famine, or disease, orany of the other evils which men refer to the anger of heaven, as theseverest of public calamities. Two young men courted a maiden of aplebeian family, highly distinguished for beauty: one of them on a levelwith the maid in point of birth, and favoured by her guardians, who werethemselves of the same rank; the other of noble birth, captivated bynothing but her beauty. The latter was aided by the good wishes of thenobles, through which party disputes made their way even into the girl'sfamily. The nobleman was preferred in the judgment of the mother, whowas anxious that her daughter should have the most splendid matchpossible: the guardians, mindful of party even in that transaction,strove for the person of their own order. As the matter could not besettled within the walls of the house, they proceeded to a court ofjustice. On hearing the claim of the mother and of the guardians, themagistrate decides the right of marriage in conformity with the wish ofthe mother. But violence was the more powerful. For the guardians,having harangued openly in the forum among persons of their own faction,on the injustice of the decree, collected a party and carry off the girlfrom her mother's house: against whom a body of nobles having arisenmore incensed than before, attends the young man rendered furious by theoutrage. A desperate battle takes place; the commons in no respect liketo the Roman commons were worsted, and having set out from the city inarms, and taken possession of a hill, make excursions into the lands ofthe nobles with fire and sword. The city too, which had been previouslyfree from all contest, they set about besieging, having induced, by thehope of plunder, a multitude of artisans to join them: nor was anyappearance or calamity of war absent; as if the whole state wereinfested by the mad rage of the two young men, who sought theaccomplishment of the fatal match through their country's ruin. The armsand war at home seemed insufficient to both parties. The nobles calledin the Romans to the relief of their besieged city; the commons calledupon the Volscians to join them in storming Ardea. The Volscians, underthe command of Cl¾lius, an ®quan, came first to Ardea, and drew a lineof circumvallation around the enemy's walls. When news of this wasbrought to Rome, Marcus Geganius, the consul, having set out immediatelyat the head of an army, selected a place for his camp about three milesfrom the enemy; and the day being now fast declining, he orders hissoldiers to refresh themselves; then at the fourth watch he puts histroops in motion; and the work, once commenced, was expedited in such amanner, that at sun-rise the Volscians found themselves enclosed by theRomans with stronger works than the city was by themselves. The consulhad also at another place connected an arm to the wall of Ardea, throughwhich his friends might pass to and from the town."Book 4,Chapter 10,"The Volscian general, who up to that period had maintained his army,not out of provisions which had been previously provided, but with cornbrought in daily from the plunder of the country, when now encompassedby a rampart he perceives himself suddenly destitute of every thing,calling the consul to a conference, says, that ""if the Roman came forthe purpose of raising the siege, he would withdraw the Volscians fromthence."" To this the consul made answer, that ""the vanquished had toaccept terms, not to dictate them; and as the Volscians came at theirown discretion to attack the allies of the Roman people, they should notgo off in the same same way."" He orders, ""that their general be givenup, their arms laid down, acknowledging themselves vanquished, and readyto submit to his further orders: otherwise, whether they went away orstayed, that he would prove a determined enemy, and would prefer tocarry to Rome a victory over the Volscians than an insidious peace.""The Volscians, determined on trying the slender hope they had in arms,all other being now cut off, besides many other disadvantages, havingcome to an engagement in a place unfavourable for fighting, and stillmore so for retreat, when they were being cut down on every side, fromfighting have recourse to entreaties; having given up their general andsurrendered their arms, they are sent under the yoke and dismissed fullof disgrace and suffering, with one garment each. And when they haltednot far from the city of Tusculum, in consequence of an old grudge ofthe Tusculans they were surprised, unarmed as they were, and sufferedsevere punishment, a messenger being scarcely left to bring an accountof their defeat. The Roman general quieted the disturbed state ofaffairs at Ardea, beheading the principal authors of that commotion, andconfiscating their effects to the public treasury of the Ardeans; theArdeans considered the injustice of the decision completely repaired bysuch kindness on the part of the Roman people; it seemed to the senate,however, that something remained to be done to obliterate theremembrance of public avarice. The consul returns to the city intriumph, Cl¾lius, the general of the Volscians, being led before hischariot, and the spoils being carried before him, of which he hadstripped the enemy's army after he had sent them under the yoke.Quintius the consul, by his civil administration, equalled, which is noeasy matter, the glory attained by his colleague in war; for he soregulated the domestic care of harmony and peace, by dispensing justicewith moderation to the highest and the lowest, that both the patriciansconsidered him a strict consul, and the commons, as one sufficientlylenient. Against the tribunes too he carried his measures more by hisinfluence than by striving against them. Five consulships conducted withthe same even tenor of conduct, and every part of his life being passedin a manner worthy of the consular dignity, rendered himself almost morevenerable than the high office itself. On this account no mention wasmade of the military tribunes during this consulate."Book 4,Chapter 11,"They appoint as consuls Marcus Fabius Vibulanus, Publius ®butiusCornicen. Fabius and ®butius, the consuls, inasmuch as they perceivedthat they succeeded to a greater glory of achievements performed at homeand abroad, (the year was rendered particularly remarkable among theneighbouring states, both friendly and hostile, because relief had beenafforded to the Ardeans in their perilous situation with so much zeal,)the more strenuously exerted themselves in obtaining a decree of thesenate, that they might completely efface the infamy of the decisionfrom the memory of men, to the effect that since the state of theArdeans had been reduced to a few by intestine war, a colony should besent thither as a protection against the Volscians. This is what wasstated publicly on the tables, that the intention entertained ofrescinding the decision might escape the knowledge of the commons andtribunes. But they had agreed that, a much greater number of Rutuliancolonists being enrolled than of Romans, no land should be distributed,except that which had been intercepted by the infamous decision; andthat not a sod of it should be assigned to any Roman, until all theRutulians had had their share. In this way the land returned to theArdeans. The commissioners appointed to transplant the colony to Ardeawere Agrippa Menenius, Titus Cl¾lius Siculus, and Marcus ®butius Elva.When they, in the discharge of their by no means popular office, hadgiven offence to the commons by assigning to the allies the land whichthe Roman people had decided to be their own, and were not even muchsupported by the patricians, because they had not deferred in any way tothe influence of any one, a day having been appointed for them by thetribunes to appear before the people, they escaped all vexatiousannoyance by enrolling themselves as settlers and remaining in thecolony, which they now had as a testimony of their integrity andjustice."Book 4,Chapter 12,"There was peace at home and abroad both this and the following year,Caius Furius Pacilus and Marcus Papirius Crassus being consuls. Thegames which had been vowed by the decemvirs, in pursuance of a decree ofthe senate on occasion of the secession of the commons from thepatricians, were performed this year. An occasion for sedition wassought in vain by P¾telius, who, having been made a tribune of thecommons a second time, by denouncing these same threats, could neitherprevail on the consuls to submit to the senate the questions concerningthe division of the lands among the people; and when, after a hardstruggle, he had succeeded so far that the patricians should beconsulted as to whether it was their pleasure that an election should beheld of consuls or of tribunes, consuls were ordered to be elected; andthe menaces of the tribune were now laughed at, when he threatened thathe would stop the levy, inasmuch as the neighbouring states being nowquiet, there was no occasion either for war or for preparations for war.This tranquil state of things is followed by a year, in which ProculusGeganius Macerinus, Lucius Menenius Lanatus were consuls, remarkable fora variety of disasters and dangers, also for disturbances, famine, fortheir having almost submitted their necks to the yoke of arbitrary powerthrough the allurement of largesses. Foreign war alone was wanting, bywhich if matters had been aggravated, they could scarcely have stood outagainst them by the aid of all the gods. Their misfortunes began withfamine; whether it was that the season was unfavourable to the crops, orthat the cultivation of the land was relinquished for the allurements ofthe city, and of public harangues; for both causes are assigned. And thepatricians accused the commons as being idle; the tribunes of thecommons complained sometimes of the fraud, at other times of thenegligence of the consuls. At length the commons prevailed, withoutopposition on the part of the senate, that Lucius Minutius should beappointed president of the market; doomed to be more successful in thatoffice in preserving liberty than in the discharge of his own peculiarprovince: although in the end he bore away the well-earned gratitude ofthe people as well as the glory of having lowered the price ofprovisions. When he had made but slight advance in relieving the marketsby sending embassies around the neighbouring states by land and sea tono purpose, except that an inconsiderable quantity of corn was importedfrom Etruria, and applying himself to the careful dispensations of theirscanty stock, by obliging persons to show their supply, and to sellwhatever was over and above a month's provision, and by depriving theslaves of one half of their daily allowance; then by censuring andholding up to the resentment of the people the corn-hoarders, he ratherdiscovered the great scarcity of grain than relieved it by this rigorousinquisition. Many of the commons, all hope being lost, rather than betortured by dragging out existence, muffled up their heads andprecipitated themselves into the Tiber."Book 4,Chapter 13,"Then Spurius M¾lius, of the equestrian order, extremely richconsidering these times, set about a project useful in itself, buthaving a most pernicious tendency, and a still more pernicious motive.For having, by the assistance of his friends and clients, bought up cornfrom Etruria at his private expense, (which very circumstance, I think,had been an impediment in the endeavour to reduce the price of corn bythe exertions of the state,) he set about giving out largesses of corn:and having won over the commons by this munificence, he drew them withhim wherever he went, conspicuous and consequential beyond the rank of aprivate citizen, insuring to him as undoubted the consulship by thefavour (they manifested towards him) and the hopes (they excited inhim.) He himself, as the mind of man is not to be satiated with thatwhich fortune holds out the hope of, began to aspire to things stillhigher, and altogether unwarrantable; and since even the consulshipwould have to be taken from the patricians against their will, he beganto set his mind on kingly power;--that that would be the only prizeworthy of such grand designs and of the struggle which would have to beendured. The consular elections were now coming on, which circumstancedestroyed him completely, his plans being not yet arranged orsufficiently matured. Titus Quintius Capitolinus was elected consul forthe sixth time, a man by no means well suited to answer the views of onemeditating political innovations: Agrippa Menenius is attached to him ascolleague, who bore the cognomen of Lanatus: and Lucius Minutius aspresident of the markets, whether he was re-elected, or created for anindefinite period, as long as circumstances should require; for there isnothing certain in the matter, except this, his name was entered aspresident in the linen books among the magistrates for both years. HereMinucius, conducting the same office in a public capacity which M¾liushad undertaken to conduct in a private character, the same class ofpersons frequenting the houses of both, having ascertained the matter,lays it before the senate, ""that arms were collecting in the house ofM¾lius, and that he held assemblies in his house: and that his designswere unquestionably bent on regal dominion: that the time for theexecution of the project was not yet fixed: that all other matters weresettled; and that the tribunes were bought over for hire to betray thepublic liberty, and that the several parts were assigned to the leadersof the multitude. That he laid these things before them almost laterthan was consistent with safety, lest he might be the reporter of anything uncertain or ill-grounded."" When these things were heard, thechiefs of the patricians both rebuked the consuls of the former year,for having suffered those largesses and meetings of the people to go onin a private house, as well as the new consuls for having waited until amatter of such importance should be reported to the senate by thepresident of the markets, which required the consul to be not only thereporter, but the punisher also; then Titus Quintius said, ""that theconsuls were unfairly censured, who being fettered by the lawsconcerning appeal, enacted to weaken their authority, by no meanspossessed as much power in their office as will, to punish thatproceeding according to its atrocity. That there was wanting a man notonly determined in himself, but one who was unshackled and freed fromthe fetters of those laws. That he would therefore appoint LuciusQuintius dictator; that in him there would be a determination suitableto so great a power."" Whilst all approved, Quintius at first refused;and asked them what they meant, in exposing him in the extremity of ageto such a contest. Then when they all said that in that aged mind therewas not only more wisdom, but more energy also, than in all the rest,and went on loading him with deserved praises, whilst the consul relaxednot in his original determination; Cincinnatus at length having prayedto the immortal gods, that his old age might not prove a detriment ordisgrace to the republic at so dangerous a juncture, is appointeddictator by the consul: he himself then appoints Caius Servilius Ahalahis master of the horse."Book 4,Chapter 14,"On the next day, having stationed proper guards, when he had gonedown to the forum, and the attention of the commons was attracted to himby the strangeness and extraordinary nature of the thing, and M¾lius'sfriends and himself their leader perceived that the power of such highauthority was directly aimed at them; when, moreover, those who were notaware of the designs on regal power, went on asking, ""what tumult, whatsudden war, had called for either the dictatorial authority, orQuintius, after his eightieth year, administrator of affairs,""Servilius, master of the horse, being sent by the dictator to M¾lius,says, ""The dictator summons you."" When he, being alarmed, asked what hemeant, and Servilius stated that ""he must stand a trial,"" and answer thecharge brought against him before the senate by Minucius, M¾lius drewback into the band of his adherents, and at first, looking around him,he began to skulk off: at length when the beadle, by order of the masterof the horse, was bringing him off, being rescued by those present, andrunning away, he implored the protection of the Roman people, andalleged that he was persecuted by a conspiracy of the patricians becausehe had acted kindly towards the people: he besought them that they wouldassist him in this critical emergency, and not suffer him to bebutchered before their eyes. Ahala Servilius overtook and slew himwhilst exclaiming in this manner; and smeared with the blood of theperson so slain, and surrounded by a body of young nobles, he carriesback word to the dictator that M¾lius having been summoned to him, andcommencing to excite the multitude after he had repulsed the beadle, hadreceived condign punishment. ""Thou hast acted nobly, Caius Servilius,""said the dictator, ""in having saved the republic."""Book 4,Chapter 15,"He then ordered the multitude, who were much agitated, not knowingwhat judgment to form of the deed, to be called to an assembly: and heopenly declared, ""that M¾lius had been justly put to death, even thoughhe may have been innocent of the charge of aiming at regal power, who,when summoned to attend the dictator by the master of the horse, had notcome. That he himself had taken his seat to examine into the case; that,after it had been investigated, M¾lius should have met a resultcorresponding to his deserts; that when employing force, in order thathe might not commit himself to a trial, he had been checked by force.Nor should they proceed with him as with a citizen, who, born in a freestate amid laws and rights, in a city from which he knew that kings hadbeen expelled, and on the same year the sons of the king's sister andthe children of the consul, the liberator of his country, had been putto death by their father, on a plot for readmitting the royal familyinto the city having been discovered, from which Collatinus Tarquiniusthe consul, through a hatred of his name, was ordered to resign hisoffice and go into exile; in which capital punishment was inflicted onSpurius Cassius several years after for forming designs to assume thesovereignty; in which the decemvirs were recently punished withconfiscation, exile, and death, in consequence of regal tyranny in thatcity, Spurius M¾lius conceived a hope of attaining regal power. And whowas this man? Although no nobility, no honours, no deserts should opento any man the road to domination, yet still the Claudii and Cassii, byreason of the consulates, the decemvirates, the honours of their own andthose of their ancestors, and from the splendour of their families, hadraised their aspiring minds to heights to which it was impious to raisethem: that Spurius M¾lius, to whom a tribuneship of the commons shouldrather be an object of wishes than of hope, a wealthy corn-merchant, hadconceived the hope to purchase the liberty of his countrymen for twopounds of corn; had supposed that a people victorious over all theirneighbours could be cajoled into servitude by throwing them a morsel offood; so that a person whom the state could scarcely digest as asenator, it should tolerate as king, possessing the ensigns andauthority of Romulus their founder, who had descended from and hadreturned to the gods. This was to be considered not more criminal thanit was monstrous: nor was it sufficiently expiated by his blood; unlessthe roof and walls within which so mad a project had been conceived,should be levelled to the ground, and his effects were confiscated, asbeing contaminated with the price of purchasing kingly domination. Heordered, therefore, that the qu¾stors should sell this property anddeposit the proceeds in the treasury."""Book 4,Chapter 16,"He then ordered his house to be immediately razed, that the vacantground might serve as a monument of nefarious hopes destroyed. This wascalled ®quim¾lium. Lucius Minucius was presented with a gilded ox on theoutside of the gate Trigemina, and this not even against the will of thecommons, because he distributed M¾lius's corn, after valuing it at one_as_ per bushel. In some writers I find that this Minucius had changedsides from the patricians to the commons, and that having been chosen aseleventh tribune of the people, he quieted a commotion which arose onthe death of M¾lius. But it is scarcely credible that the patricianswould have suffered the number of the tribunes to be increased, and thatsuch a precedent should be introduced more particularly in the case of aman who was a patrician; or that the commons did not afterwardsmaintain, or at least attempt, that privilege once conceded to them. Butthe legal provision made a few years before, viz. that it should not belawful for the tribunes to choose a colleague, refutes beyond everything else the false inscription on the statue. Quintus C¾cilius,Quintus Junius, Sextus Titinius, were the only members of the college oftribunes who had not been concerned in passing the law for conferringhonours on Minucius; nor did they cease both to throw out censures onetime on Minucius, at another time on Servilius, before the commons, andto complain of the unmerited death of M¾lius. They succeeded, therefore,in having an election held for military tribunes rather than forconsuls, not doubting but that in six places, for so many were nowallowed to be elected, some plebeians also might be appointed, by theirprofessing to be avengers of the death of M¾lius. The commons, thoughthey had been agitated that year by many and various commotions, neitherelected more than three tribunes with consular power; and among themLucius Quintius, son of Cincinnatus, from the unpopular nature of whosedictatorship an occasion for disturbance was sought. Mamercus ®milius, aman of the highest dignity, was voted in, prior to Quintius. In thethird place they appoint Lucius Julius."Book 4,Chapter 17,"During their office Fiden¾, a Roman colony, revolted to LarsTolunmius, king of the Veientians, and to the Veientians. To the revolta more heinous crime was added. By order of Tolumnius they put to deathCaius Fulcinius, Cl¾lius Tullus, Spurius Antius, Lucius Roscius, Romanambassadors, who came to inquire into the reason of this new line ofconduct. Some palliate the guilt of the king; that an ambiguousexpression of his, during a lucky throw of dice, having been mistaken bythe Fidenatians, as if it seemed to be an order for their execution, hadbeen the cause of the ambassadors' death. An incredible tale; that histhoughts should not have been drawn away from the game on the arrival ofthe Fidenatians, his new allies, when consulting him on a murder tendingto violate the law of nations; and that the act was not afterwardsviewed by him with horror. It is more probable that he wished the stateof the Fidenatians to be so compromised by their participation in sogreat a crime, that they might not afterwards look to any hope from theRomans. Statues of the ambassadors, who were slain at Fiden¾, were setup in the rostra at the public expense. A desperate struggle was comingon with the Veientians and Fidenatians, who, besides that they wereneighbouring states, had commenced the war with so heinous aprovocation. Therefore, the commons and their tribunes being now quiet,so as to attend to the general welfare, there was no dispute withrespect to the electing of Marcus Geganius Macerinus a third time, andLucius Sergius Fidenas, as consuls; so called, I suppose, from the warwhich he afterwards conducted. For he was the first who fought asuccessful battle with the king of the Veientians on this side of theAnio, nor did he obtain an unbloody victory. Greater grief was thereforefelt from the loss of their countrymen, than joy from the defeat of theenemy: and the senate, as in an alarming crisis, ordered Mamercus®milius to be appointed dictator. He appointed as his master of thehorse from the college of the preceding year, in which there had beentribunes of the soldiers with consular power, Lucius QuintiusCincinnatus, a youth worthy of his parent. To the levy held by theconsuls were added the old centurions well versed in war, and the numberof those lost in the late battle was made up. The dictator orderedLucius Quintius Capitolinus and Marcus Fabius Vibulanus to attend him ashis lieutenants-general. Both the higher powers, and the man suitable tosuch powers, caused the enemy to move from the Roman territory to theother side of the Anio, and continuing their retrograde movement, theytook possession of the hills between Fiden¾ and the Anio, nor did theydescend into the plains until the troops of the Faliscians came to theiraid; then at length the camp of the Etrurians was pitched before thewalls of Fiden¾. The Roman dictator took his post at no great distancefrom thence at the conflux on the banks of both rivers, lines being runacross between them, as far as he was able to follow by a fortification.Next day he marched out his army into the field."Book 4,Chapter 18,"Among the enemy there was a diversity of opinion. The Faliscians,impatient of the hardships of war at a distance from home, andsufficiently confident of their own strength, earnestly demandedbattle; the Veientians and Fidenatians placed more hope in protractingthe war. Tolumnius, though the measures of his own subjects were moreagreeable to him, proclaims that he would give battle on the followingday, lest the Faliscians might not brook the service at so great adistance from their home. The dictator and the Romans took additionalcourage from the fact of the enemy having declined giving battle: and onthe following day, the soldiers exclaiming that they would attack thecamp and the city, if an opportunity of fighting were not afforded them,the armies advance on both sides into the middle of a plain between thetwo camps. The Veientians, having the advantage in numbers, sent arounda party behind the mountains to attack the Roman camp during the heat ofthe battle. The army of the three states stood drawn up in such amanner, that the Veientians occupied the right wing, the Faliscians theleft, whilst the Fidenatians constituted the centre. The dictatorcharged on the right wing against the Faliscians, Quintius Capitolinuson the left against the Veientians, and the master of the horse with thecavalry advanced in the centre. For a short time all was silence andquiet, the Etrurians being determined not to engage unless they werecompelled, and the dictator looking back towards a Roman fort, until asignal should be raised, as had been agreed on, by the augurs, as soonas the birds had given a favourable omen. As soon as he perceived this,he orders the cavalry first to charge the enemy, after raising a loudshout; the line of infantry following, engaged with great fury. In noquarter did the Etrurian legions withstand the shock of the Romans. Thecavalry made the greatest resistance; and the king himself, far thebravest of the cavalry, charging the Romans whilst they were pursuing indisorder in every direction, prolonged the contest."Book 4,Chapter 19,"There was then among the cavalry, Aulus Cornelius Cossus, a tribuneof the soldiers, distinguished for the beauty of his person, and equallyso for courage and great strength of body, and mindful of his rank,which, having received in a state of the highest lustre, he left to hisposterity still greater and more distinguished. He perceiving that theRoman troops gave way at the approach of Tolumnius, wherever he directedhis charge, and knowing him as being remarkable by his royal apparel, ashe flew through the entire line, exclaims, ""Is this the infringer ofhuman treaties and the violator of the law of nations? This victim Ishall now slay, (provided the gods wish that there should be any thingsacred on earth,) and shall offer him up to the manes of theambassadors."" Having clapped spurs to his horse, he advances againstthis single foe with spear presented; and after having struck andunhorsed him, he immediately, by help of his lance, sprung on theground. And as the king attempted to rise, he throws him back again withthe boss of his shield, and with repeated thrusts pins him to the earth.He then stripped off the spoils from the lifeless body; and having cutoff his head and carrying it on the point of his spear, he puts theenemy to rout through terror on seeing their king slain. Thus the lineof cavalry, which alone had rendered the combat doubtful, was beaten.The dictator pursues closely the routed legions, and drove them to theircamp with slaughter. The greater number of the Fidenatians, throughtheir knowledge of the country, made their escape to the mountains.Cossus, having crossed the Tiber with the cavalry, carried off greatplunder from the Veientian territory to the city. During the battlethere was a fight also at the Roman camp against a party of the forces,which, as has been already mentioned, had been sent by Tolumnius to thecamp. Fabius Vibulanus first defends his lines by a ring; then, whilstthe enemy were wholly taken up with the entrenchment, sallying out fromthe principal gate on the right, he suddenly attacks them with thetriarii: and a panic being thus struck into them there was lessslaughter, because they were fewer, but their flight was no lessdisorderly than it had been on the field of battle."Book 4,Chapter 20,"Matters being managed successfully in every direction, the dictator,by a decree of the senate and order of the people, returned to the cityin triumph. By far the most remarkable object in the triumph was Cossus,bearing the _spolia opima_ of the king he had slain. The soldierschaunted their uncouth verses on him, extolling him as equal to Romulus.With the usual form of dedication, he presented, as an offering, thespoils in the temple of Jupiter Feretrius, near the spoils of Romulus,which, having been the first called _opima_, were the only ones at thattime; and he attracted the eyes of all the citizens from the dictator'schariot to himself, and enjoyed almost solely the honour of that day'ssolemnity. The dictator offered up to Jupiter in the Capitol a goldencrown a pound in weight, at the public expense, by order of the people.Following all the Roman writers, I have represented Aulus CorneliusCossus as a military tribune, when he carried the second _spolia opima_to the temple of Jupiter Feretrius. But besides that those spoils arerightly considered _opima_, which one general has taken from another;and we know no general but the person under whose auspices the war isconducted, the inscription itself written on the spoils proves, againstboth me and them, that Cossus was consul when he took them. Having onceheard Augustus C¾sar, the founder or restorer of all our temples, onentering the temple of Jupiter Feretrius, which being dilapidated bytime he rebuilt, aver that he himself had read the said inscription onthe linen breastplate, I thought it would be next to sacrilege to robCossus of such a testimony respecting his spoils as that of C¾sar, therenovator of the temple itself. Whether the mistake is chargeable on thevery ancient annals and the linen books of the magistrates, deposited inthe temple of Moneta, and which Licinius Macer occasionally cites asauthorities, which have Aulus Cornelius Cossus consul with TitusQuintius Pennus, in the ninth year after this, every person may form hisown opinion. For there is this additional proof, that a battle socelebrated could not be transferred to that year; that the three yearsbefore and after the consulship of Aulus Cornelius were entirely freefrom war, in consequence of a pestilence and a scarcity of grain; sothat some annals, as if in mourning, present nothing but the names ofthe consuls. The third year from the consulship of Cossus has him asmilitary tribune with consular power; in the same year as master of thehorse, in which office he fought another distinguished horse battle.Conjecture is open on the matter; but, as I think, idle surmises may beturned to support any opinion: when the hero of the fight, having placedthe recent spoils in the sacred repository, having before him Jovehimself, to whom they were consecrated, and Romulus, no contemptiblewitnesses in case of a false inscription, entitled himself AulusCornelius Cossus consul."Book 4,Chapter 21,"Marcus Cornelius Maluginensis and Lucius Papirius Crassus beingconsuls, the armies were led into the territories of the Veientians andFaliscians; numbers of men and cattle were driven off as spoil; theenemy was no where to be found on the land, and no opportunity offighting was afforded; the cities however were not attacked, because apestilential disorder ran through the people. Disturbances were alsosought at home, but not actually excited, however, by Spurius M¾lius,tribune of the people; who thinking that he might create some tumultthrough the popularity of his name, had both appointed a day of trialfor Minucius, and had also proposed a law for confiscating the propertyof Servilius Ahala: alleging that M¾lius had been circumvented throughfalse impeachments by Minucius, charging Servilius with the killing of acitizen on whom no sentence had been passed; charges which, when broughtbefore the people, proved to be more idle than the author himself. Butthe virulence of the disease now becoming worse, was more an object ofconcern to them, as also the terrors and prodigies, more especiallybecause accounts were being brought, that houses were falling throughoutthe country, in consequence of frequent earthquakes. A supplication wastherefore performed by the people, according to the form dictated by thedecemvirs.[153] The year being still more pestilential, Caius Julius asecond time and Lucius Virginius being consuls, occasioned such dread ofdesolation through the city and country, that not only no one left theRoman territory for the purpose of committing depredations, and not onlydid none of the patricians or commons entertain an idea of commencingany military aggressions; but the Fidenatians, who at first had shutthemselves up either within their town, or mountains, or fortifications,now descended without provocation to commit depredations on the Romanterritory. Then the army of the Veientians being called in to their aid,(for the Faliscians could be induced to renew the war neither by thedistresses of the Romans, nor by the remonstrances of their allies,) thetwo states crossed the Anio; and displayed their ensigns at no greatdistance from the Colline gate. Great consternation arose therefore, notmore in the country than in the city. Julius the consul draws up histroops on the rampart and walls; the senate is consulted by Virginius inthe temple of Quirinus. It is determined that Aulus Servilius beappointed dictator, who some say had the cognomen of Priscus, othersthat of Structus. Virginius having delayed whilst he consulted hiscolleague, with his permission, named the dictator at night. He appointsPostumus ®butius Elva his master of the horse."Book 4,Chapter 22,"The dictator orders all to attend at break of day outside theColline gate. All whosoever had sufficient strength to bear arms,attended; the standards were quickly brought forth from the treasury andconveyed to the dictator. Whilst these matters were going on, theenemies retired to the higher grounds; thither the dictator follows themwith a determined army; and having come to a general engagement not farfrom Nomentum, he routed the Etrurian legions; he then drove them intothe city of Fiden¾, and surrounded it with a rampart. But neither couldthe city be taken by storm as being high and well fortified, nor wasthere any effect in a blockade, because corn was supplied to them inabundance not only for necessary consumption, but for plenty also, inconsequence of that previously laid up. Thus all hope being lost oftaking it by assault, or of forcing it to a surrender, the dictatordetermined on carrying a sap into the citadel in places which were wellknown to him on account of their near situation on the remote side ofthe city, as being most neglected because it was best protected byreason of its own nature; he himself by advancing up to the walls inplaces most remote, with his army divided into four sections, which wereto succeed each other in the action, by continuing the fight day andnight continuously he prevented the enemy from perceiving the work;until the mountain being dug through from the camp, a passage was openedup into the citadel; and the Etrurians being diverted from the realdanger by the idle threats, the shouting of the enemy over their headsproved to them that their city was taken. On that year Caius FuriusPacilus and Marcus Geganius Macerinus, censors, approved of the publicedifice[154] in the Campus Martius, and the census of the people wasthere performed for the first time."Book 4,Chapter 23,"That the same consuls were re-elected on the following year, Juliusfor the third time, Virginius for the second time, I find in LiciniusMacer. Valerius Antias and Quintus Tubero state that Marcus Manlius andQuintus Sulpicius were, the consuls for that year. But inrepresentations so different both Tubero and Macer cite the linen booksas their authority; neither of them denies that it was said by ancienthistorians that there were military tribunes on that year. Liciniusthinks that we should unhesitatingly follow the linen books; and Tuberois uncertain as to the truth. But this also is left unsettled amongother points not ascertained from length of time. Alarm was raised inEtruria after the capture of Fiden¾, not only the Veientians beingterrified by the apprehension of similar ruin, but the Faliscians also,from the recollection of the war having first commenced with them,although they had not joined with those who renewed hostilities.Accordingly when the two nations, having sent ambassadors around to thetwelve states, succeeded so far that a general meeting was proclaimedfor all Etruria at the temple of Voltumna; the senate, apprehending agreat attack threatening from that quarter, ordered Mamercus ®miliusagain to be appointed dictator. Aulus Postumius Tubertus was appointedby him as master of the horse; and preparations for war were made withso much the more energy than on the last occasion, in proportion asthere was more danger from the whole body of Etruria than from two ofits states."Book 4,Chapter 24,"That matter passed off much more quietly than any one expected.Therefore when word was brought by certain traders, that aid was refusedto the Veientians, and that they were bid to prosecute with their ownstrength a war entered into on their own separate views, and not to seekout persons as sharers in their distresses, to whom they had notcommunicated their hopes when flourishing; the dictator, that hisappointment might not be in vain, all opportunity of acquiring militaryglory being now taken from him, desirous of performing during peace somework which might serve as a memorial of his dictatorship, sets aboutlimiting the censorship, either judging its powers excessive, ordisapproving of the duration rather than the extent of the office.Accordingly, having summoned a meeting, he says ""that the immortal godshad taken on themselves that the public affairs should be managedexternally, and that the general security should be insured; that withrespect to what was to be done within the walls, he would provide forthe liberty of the Roman people. But that the most effectual guarding ofit was, that offices of great power should not be of long continuance;and that a limit of time should be set to those to which a limit ofjurisdiction could not be set. That other offices were annual, that thecensorship was quinquennial; that it was a grievance to be subject tothe same individuals for such a number of years in a considerable partof the affairs of life. That he would propose a law, that the censorshipshould not last longer than a year and half."" Amid the great approbationof the people he passed the law on the following day, and says, ""thatyou may know, Romans, in reality, how little pleasing to me are officesof long duration, I resign the dictatorship."" Having laid down his ownoffice, and set a limit to the office of others, he was escorted homewith the congratulation and great good will of the people. The censorsresenting Mamercus' conduct for his having diminished the duration ofone of the offices of the Roman people, degraded him from his tribe, andincreasing his taxes eight-fold, disfranchised[155] him. They say thathe bore this with great magnanimity, as he considered the cause of thedisgrace, rather than the disgrace itself; that the principal patriciansalso, though they had been averse to the curtailing the privileges ofthe censorship, were much displeased at this instance of censorialseverity; inasmuch as each saw that he would be longer and morefrequently subjected to the censors, than he should hold the office ofcensor. Certain it is that such indignation is said to have arisen onthe part of the people, that violence could not be kept off from thecensors through the influence of any person except of Mamercus himself."Book 4,Chapter 25,"The tribunes of the people, by preventing the election of consuls byincessant harangues, succeeded at length, after the matter had been wellnigh brought to an interregnum, in having tribunes of the soldierselected with consular authority: as for the prize of their victory,which was the thing sought, _scil._ that a plebeian should be elected,there was none. All patricians were elected, Marcus Fabius Vibulanus,Marcus Foslius, Lucius Sergius Fidenas. The pestilence during that yearafforded a quiet in other matters. A temple was vowed to Apollo for thehealth of the people. The duumvirs did much, by direction of the books,for the purpose of appeasing the wrath of heaven and averting the plaguefrom the people; a great mortality however was sustained in the city andcountry, by the death of men and of cattle promiscuously. Apprehending afamine for the agriculturists, they sent into Etruria, and the Pomptinedistrict, and to Cum¾, and at last to Sicily also to procure corn. Nomention was made of electing consuls. Military tribunes with consularauthority were appointed, all patricians, Lucius Pinarius Mamercinus,Lucius Furius Medullinus, Spurius Postumius Albus. In this year theviolence of the distemper abated, nor was there any danger from ascarcity of corn, because provision had been previously made against it.Schemes for exciting wars were agitated in the meetings of the ®quansand Volscians, and in Etruria at the temple of Voltumna. Here the matterwas postponed for a year, and by a decree it was enacted, that nomeeting should be held before that time, the Veientian state in vaincomplaining that the same destiny hung over Veii, as that by whichFiden¾ was destroyed. Meanwhile at Rome the chiefs of the commons, whohad now for a long time been vainly pursuing the hope of higher dignity,whilst there was tranquillity abroad, appointed meetings to be held inthe houses of the tribunes of the commons. There they concerted plans insecret: they complained ""that they were so despised by the commons, thatthough tribunes of the soldiers, with consular authority, were nowappointed for so many years, no plebeian ever obtained access to thathonour. That their ancestors had shown much foresight in providing thatplebeian offices should not be open to any patrician; otherwise theyshould be forced to have patricians as tribunes of the commons; sodespicable were they even with their own party, and were not lessdespised by the commons than by the patricians."" Others exculpated thecommons, and threw the blame on the patricians,--""that by theirintriguing and schemes it happened that the road to honour was barredagainst the commons. If the commons were allowed to breathe from theirmixed entreaties and menaces, that they would enter on their suffrageswith a due regard to men of their own party; and, assistance beingalready procured, that they would assume a share in the governmentalso."" It is determined that, for the purpose of doing away with allintriguing, the tribunes should propose a law, that no person be allowedto add white to his garment for the purposes of canvassing. The mattermay now appear trivial and scarcely deserving serious consideration,which then enkindled such strife between the patricians and commons. Thetribunes, however, prevailed in carrying the law; and it appearedevident, that in their present state of irritation, the commons wouldincline their support to men of their own party; and lest this should beoptional with them, a decree of the senate is passed, that the electionfor consuls should be held."Book 4,Chapter 26,"The cause was the rising, which the Hernicians and Latins announcedas about to take place on the part of the ®quans and Volscians. TitusQuintius Cincinnatus, son of Lucius, (to the same person the cognomen ofPennus also is annexed,) and Caius Julius Mento were elected consuls:nor was the terror of war longer deferred. A levy being held under thedevoting law, which with them is the most powerful instrument of forcingmen into service, powerful armies set out from thence, and met atAlgidum; and there the ®quans and Volscians fortified their campsseparately; and the general took greater care than ever before tofortify their posts and train their soldiers; so much the more terrordid the messengers bring to Rome. The senate wished that a dictatorshould be appointed, because though these nations had been oftenconquered, yet they renewed hostilities with more vigorous efforts thanever before, and a considerable number of the Roman youth had beencarried off by sickness. Above all, the perverseness of the consuls, andthe disagreement between them, and their contentions in all thecouncils, terrified them. There are some who state that an unsuccessfulbattle was fought by these consuls at Algidum, and that such was thecause of appointing a dictator. This much is certain, that, thoughdiffering in other points, they perfectly agreed in one against thewishes of the patricians, not to nominate a dictator; until whenaccounts were brought, one more alarming than another, and the consulswould not be swayed by the authority of the senate, Quintus ServiliusPriscus, who had passed through the highest honours with singularhonour, says, ""Tribunes of the people, since we are come toextremities, the senate calls on you, that you would, by virtue of yourauthority, compel the consuls to nominate a dictator in so critical aconjuncture of the state."" On hearing this, the tribunes, conceivingthat an opportunity was presented to them of extending their power,retire together, and declare for their college, that ""it was their wishthat the consuls should be obedient to the instruction of the senate; ifthey persisted further against the consent of that most illustriousorder, that they would order them to be taken to prison."" The consulswere better pleased to be overcome by the tribunes than by the senate,alleging that the prerogatives of the highest magistracy were betrayedby the patricians and the consulship subjugated to tribunitian power,inasmuch as the consuls were liable to be overruled by a tribune in anyparticular by virtue of his power, and (what greater hardship could aprivate man have to dread?) even to be carried off to prison. The lot tonominate the dictator (for the colleagues had not even agreed on that)fell on Titus Quintius. He appointed a dictator, Aulus PostumiusTubertus, his own father-in-law, a man of the utmost strictness incommand: by him Lucius Julius was appointed master of the horse: asuspension of civil business is also proclaimed; and, that nothing elseshould be attended to throughout the city but preparations for war, theexamination of the cases of those who claimed exemption from themilitary service is deferred till after the war. Thus even doubtfulpersons are induced to give in their names. Soldiers were also enjoinedof the Hernicians and Latins: the most zealous obedience is shown to thedictator on both sides."Book 4,Chapter 27,"All these measures were executed with great despatch: and CaiusJulius the consul being left to guard the city, and Lucius Julius masterof the horse, for the sudden exigencies of the war, lest any thing whichthey might want in the camp should cause delay, the dictator, repeatingthe words after Aulus Cornelius the chief pontiff, vowed the great gameson account of the sudden war; and having set out from the city, afterdividing his army with the consul Quintius, he came up with the enemy.As they had observed two separate camps of the enemy at a small distanceone from the other, they in like manner encamped separately about a milefrom them, the dictator towards Tusculum, the consul towards Lanuvium.Thus they had their four armies, as many fortified posts, having betweenthem a plain sufficiently extended not only for excursions to skirmish,but even for drawing up the armies on both sides in battle-array. Fromthe time camp was brought close to camp, they ceased not from lightskirmishing, the dictator readily allowing his soldiers, by comparingstrength, to entertain beforehand the hope of a general victory, afterthey had gradually essayed the result of slight skirmishes. Whereforethe enemy, no hope being now left in a regular engagement, attacked theconsuls' camp in the night, and bring the matter to the chance of adoubtful result. The shout which arose suddenly awoke not only theconsuls' sentinels and then all the army, but the dictator also. Whencircumstances required instant exertion, the consul evinced nodeficiency either in spirit or in judgment. One part of the troopsreinforce the guards at the gates, another man the rampart around. Inthe other camp with the dictator, inasmuch as there is less ofconfusion, so much the more readily is it observed, what is required tobe done. Despatching then forthwith a reinforcement to the consuls'camp, to which Spurius Postumius Albus is appointed lieutenant-general,he himself with a part of his forces, making a small circuit, proceedsto a place entirely sequestered from the bustle, whence he mightsuddenly attack the enemy's rear. Quintus Sulpicius, hislieutenant-general, he appoints to take charge of the camp; to MarcusFabius as lieutenant he assigns the cavalry, and orders that thosetroops, which it would be difficult to manage amid a nightly conflict,should not stir before day-light. All the measures which any otherprudent and active general could order and execute at such a juncture,he orders and executes with regularity; that was an extraordinaryspecimen of judgment and intrepidity, and one deserving of no ordinarypraise, that he despatched Marcus Geganius with some chosen troops toattack the enemy's camp, whence it had been ascertained that they haddeparted with the greater part of their troops. When he fell on thesemen, wholly intent on the result of the danger of their friends, andincautious with respect to themselves, the watches and advanced guardsbeing even neglected, he took their camp almost before the enemy wereperfectly sure that it was attacked. Then when the signal given withsmoke, as had been agreed on, was perceived by the dictator, heexclaims that the enemy's camp was taken, and orders it to be announcedin every direction.28. And now day was appearing, and every thing lay open to view; andFabius had made an attack with his cavalry, and the consul had salliedfrom the camp on the enemy now disconcerted; when the dictator on theother side, having attacked their reserve and second line, threw hisvictorious troops, both horse and foot, in the way of the enemy as theyturned themselves about to the dissonant shouts and the various suddenassaults. Thus surrounded on every side, they would to a man havesuffered the punishment due to their reassumption of hostilities, hadnot Vectius Messius, a Volscian, a man more ennobled by his deeds thanhis extraction, upbraiding his men as they were forming a circle, calledout with a loud voice, ""Are ye about offering yourselves here to theweapons of the enemy, undefended, unavenged? why is it then ye havearms? or why have you undertaken an offensive war, ever turbulent inpeace, and dastardly in war? What hopes have you in standing here? doyou expect that some god will protect you and bear you hence? With thesword way must be opened. Come on ye, who wish to behold your homes,your parents, your wives, and your children, follow me in the way inwhich you shall see me lead you on. It is not a wall, not a rampart, butarmed men that stand in your way with arms in your hands. In valour youare equal to them; in necessity, which is the ultimate and mosteffective weapon, superior."" As he uttered these words and was puttingthem into execution, they, renewing the shout and following him, make apush in that quarter where Postumius Alba had opposed his troops tothem: and they made the victor give ground, until the dictator came up,as his own men were now retreating. To that quarter the whole weight ofthe battle was now turned. On Messius alone the fortune of the enemydepends. Many wounds and great slaughter now took place on both sides.By this time not even the Roman generals themselves fight withoutreceiving wounds, one of them, Postumius, retired from the field havinghis skull fractured by a stroke of a stone; neither the dictator couldbe removed by a wound in the shoulder, nor Fabius by having his thighalmost pinned to his horse, nor the consul by his arm being cut off,from the perilous conflict."Book 4,Chapter 28," And now day was appearing, and every thing lay open to view; andFabius had made an attack with his cavalry, and the consul had salliedfrom the camp on the enemy now disconcerted; when the dictator on theother side, having attacked their reserve and second line, threw hisvictorious troops, both horse and foot, in the way of the enemy as theyturned themselves about to the dissonant shouts and the various suddenassaults.

The consul, pursuing them in their disorderedflight to the very rampart, attacks both the camp and the rampart; inthe same direction the dictator also brings up his forces on the otherside. The assault was conducted with no less intrepidity than the battlehad been. They say that the consul even threw a standard within therampart, in order that the soldiers might push on the more briskly, andthat the first impression was made in recovering the standard. Thedictator also, having levelled the rampart, had now carried the fightinto the camp. Then the enemy began in every direction to throw downtheir arms and to surrender: and their camp also being taken, all theenemy were set up to sale, except the senators.[156] Part of the plunderwas restored to the Latins and Hernicians, when they demanded theirproperty; the remainder the dictator sold by auction: and the consul,being invested with the command of the camp, he himself, entering thecity in triumph, resigned his dictatorship. Some writers cast a gloom onthe memory of this glorious dictatorship, when they state that his son,though victorious, was beheaded by Aulus Postumius, because, tempted bya favourable opportunity of fighting to advantage, he had left his postwithout orders. We are disposed to refuse our belief; and we arewarranted by the variety of opinions on the matter. And it is anargument against it, that such orders have been entitled ""Manlian,"" not""Postumian,"" since the person who first set on foot so barbarous aprecedent, was likely to obtain the signal title of cruelty. Besides,the cognomen of ""Imperiosus"" was affixed to Manlius: Postumius has notbeen marked by any hateful brand. Caius Julius the consul, in theabsence of his colleague, without casting lots, dedicated the temple ofApollo: Quintius resenting this, when, after disbanding his army, hereturned into the city, made a complaint of it in the senate to nopurpose.To the year marked by great achievements is added an event which seemedto have no relation to the interest of Rome, viz. that theCarthaginians, destined to be such formidable enemies, then, for thefirst times on the occasion of some disturbances among the Sicilians,transported an army into Sicily in aid of one of the parties."Book 4,Chapter 30,"In the city efforts were made by the tribunes of the people thatmilitary tribunes with consular power should be elected; nor could thepoint be carried. Lucius Papirius Crassus and Lucius Junius were madeconsuls. When the ambassadors of the ®quans solicited a treaty from thesenate, and instead of a treaty a surrender was pointed out to them,they obtained a truce for eight years. The affairs of the Volscians, inaddition to the disaster sustained at Algidum, were involved in strifesand seditions by an obstinate contention between the advocates for peaceand those for war. The Romans enjoyed tranquillity on all sides. Theconsuls, having ascertained through the information of one of thecollege, that a law regarding the appraising of the fines,[157] whichwas very acceptable to the people, was about to be introduced by thetribunes, took the lead themselves in proposing it. The new consuls wereLucius Sergius Fidenas a second time, and Hostus Lucretius Tricipitinus.During their consulate nothing worth mentioning occurred. The consulswho followed them were Aulus Cornelius Cossus and Titus Quintius Pennusa second time. The Veientians made excursions into the Roman territory.A report existed that some of the youth of the Fidenatians had beenparticipators in that depredation; and the cognizance of that matter wasleft to Lucius Sergius, and Quintus Servilius and Mamercus ®milius. Someof them were sent into banishment to Ostia, because it did not appearsufficiently clear why during these days they had been absent fromFiden¾. A number of new settlers was added, and the land of those whohad fallen in war was assigned to them. There was very great distressthat year in consequence of drought; there was not only a deficiency ofrain; but the earth also destitute of its natural moisture, scarcelyenabled the rivers to flow. In some places the want of water occasionedheaps of cattle, which had died of thirst, around the springs andrivulets which were dried up; others were carried off by the mange; andthe distempers spread by infection to the human subject, and firstassailed the husbandmen and slaves; soon after the city becomes filledwith them; and not only were men's bodies afflicted by the contagion,but superstitions of various kinds, and most of them of foreign growth,took possession of their minds; persons, to whom minds enslaved bysuperstition were a source of gain, introducing by pretending todivination new modes of sacrificing; until a sense of public shame nowreached the leading men of the state, seeing in all the streets andchapels extraneous and unaccustomed ceremonies of expiation for thepurpose of obtaining the favour of the gods. A charge was then given tothe ¾diles, that they should see that no other than Roman gods should beworshipped, nor in any other manner, save that of the country. Theirresentment against the Veientians was deferred till the following year,Caius Servilius Ahala and Lucius Papirius Mugillanus being consuls. Thenalso superstitious influences prevented the immediate declaration of waror the armies being sent; they deemed it necessary that heralds shouldbe first sent to demand restitution. There had been battles foughtlately with the Veientians at Nomentum and Fiden¾; and after that atruce, not a peace, had been concluded; of which both the time hadexpired and they had renewed hostilities before the expiration. Heraldshowever were sent; and when, according to ancient usage, they were swornand demanded restitution, their application was not listened to. Thenarose a dispute whether a war should be declared by order of the people,or whether a decree of the senate would be sufficient. The tribunes, bythreatening that they would stop the levy, so far prevailed that theconsuls should take the sense of the people concerning the war. All thecenturies voted for it. In this particular also the commons showed asuperiority by gaining this point, that consuls should not be electedfor the next year."Book 4,Chapter 31,"Four military tribunes with consular authority were elected--TitusQuintius Pennus, from the consulship, Caius Furius, Marcus Postumius,and Aulus Cornelius Cossus. Of these Cossus held the command in thecity. The other three, after the levy was held, set out to Veii, andwere an instance how mischievous in military affairs is a plurality ofcommanders. By insisting each on his own plans, whilst they severallyentertained different views, they left an opportunity open to the enemyto take them at advantage. For the Veientians, taking an opportunity,attacked their line whilst still uncertain as to their movements, someordering the signal to be given, others a retreat to be sounded: theircamp, which was nigh at hand, received them in their confusion andturning their backs. There was more disgrace therefore than loss. Thestate, unaccustomed to defeat, was become melancholy; they hated thetribunes, they insisted on a dictator, the hopes of the state now seemedto rest on him. When a religious scruple interfered here also, lest adictator could not be appointed except by a consul, the augurs on beingconsulted removed that scruple. Aulus Cornelius nominated Mamercus®milius, and he himself was nominated by him master of the horse. Solittle did censorial animadversion avail, so as to prevent them fromseeking a regulator of their affairs from a family unmeritedly censured,as soon as the condition of the state stood in need of genuine merit.The Veientians elated with their success, having sent ambassadors aroundthe states of Etruria, boasting that three Roman generals had beenbeaten by them in an engagement, though they could not effect a publicco-operation in their designs, procured volunteers from all quartersallured by the hope of plunder. The state of the Fidenatians alonedetermined on renewing hostilities; and as if it would be an impiety tocommence war unless with guilt, after staining their arms with the bloodof the new settlers there, as they had on a former occasion with that ofthe ambassadors, they join the Veientians. After this the leading men ofthe two states consulted whether they should select Veii or Fiden¾ asthe seat of war. Fiden¾ appeared the more convenient. Accordingly,having crossed the Tiber, the Veientians transferred the war thither.There was great consternation at Rome. The army being recalled fromVeii, and that same army dispirited in consequence of their defeat, thecamp is pitched before the Colline gate, and armed soldiers are postedalong the walls, and a suspension of all civil business is proclaimed inthe forum, and the shops were closed; and every place becomes more liketo a camp than a city."Book 4,Chapter 32,"Then the dictator, having sent criers through the streets, andhaving summoned the alarmed citizens to an assembly, began to chide them""that they allowed their minds to depend on such slight impulses offortune, that, on the receipt of a trifling loss, which itself wassustained not by the bravery of the enemy, nor by the cowardice of theRoman army, but by the disagreement of the generals, they now dreadedthe Veientian enemy, six times vanquished, and Fiden¾, which was almosttaken oftener than attacked. That both the Romans and the enemies werethe same as they were for so many ages: that they retained the samespirits, the same bodily strength, the same arms. That he himself,Mamercus ®milius, was also the same dictator, who formerly defeated thearmies of the Veientians and Fidenatians, with the additional support ofthe Faliscians, at Nomentum. That his master of the horse, AulusCornelius, would be the same in the field, he who, as military tribunein a former war, slew Lar Tolumnius, king of the Veientians, in thesight of both armies, and brought the _spolia opima_ into the temple ofJupiter Feretrius. Wherefore that they should take up arms, mindful thatwith them were triumphs, with them spoils, with them victory; with theenemy the guilt of murdering the ambassadors contrary to the law ofnations, the massacre of the Fidenatian colonists in time of peace, theinfraction of truces, a seventh unsuccessful revolt. As soon as theyshould bring their camp near them, he was fully confident that the joyof these most impious enemies at the disgrace of the Roman army wouldnot be of long continuance, and that the Roman people would be convincedhow much better those persons deserved of the republic, who nominatedhim dictator for the third time, than those who, in consequence of hisabolishing the despotism of the censorship, would cast a slur on hissecond dictatorship."" Having offered up his vows and set out on hismarch, he pitches his camp fifteen hundred paces on this side of Fiden¾,covered on his right by mountains, on his left by the river Tiber. Heorders Titus Quintius Pennus to take possession of the mountains, and topost himself secretly on some eminence which might be in the enemy'srear. On the following day, when the Etrurians had marched out to thefield, full of confidence in consequence of their accidental success ofthe preceding day, rather than of their good fighting, he himself,having delayed a little until the senate brought back word that Quintiushad gained an eminence nigh to the citadel of Fiden¾, puts his troopsinto motion and led on his line of infantry in order of battle in theirquickest pace against the enemy: the master of the horse he directs notto commence the fight without orders; that, when it would be necessary,he would give the signal for the aid of the cavalry; then that he wouldconduct the action, mindful of his fight with the king, mindful of therich oblation, and of Romulus and Jupiter Feretrius. The legions beginthe conflict with impetuosity. The Romans, fired with hatred, gratifiedthat feeling both with deeds and words, calling the Fidenatian impious,the Veientian robbers, truce-breakers, stained with the horrid murder ofambassadors, sprinkled with the blood of their own brother-colonists,treacherous allies, and dastardly enemies."Book 4,Chapter 33,"In the very first onset they had made an impression on the enemy;when on a sudden, the gates of Fiden¾ flying open, a strange sort ofarmy sallies forth, unheard of and unseen before that time. An immensemultitude armed with fire and all blazing with fire-brands, as if urgedon by fanatical rage, rush on the enemy: and the form of this unusualmode of fighting frightened the Romans for the moment. Then thedictator, having called to him the master of the horse and the cavalry,and also Quintius from the mountains animating the fight, hastenshimself to the left wing, which, more nearly resembling a conflagrationthan a battle, had from terror given way to the flames, and exclaimswith a loud voice, ""Vanquished by smoke, driven from your ground as if aswarm of bees, will ye yield to an unarmed enemy? will ye not extinguishthe fires with the sword? or if it is with fire, not with weapons, weare to fight, will ye not, each in his post, snatch those brands, andhurl them on them? Come, mindful of the Roman name, of the valour ofyour fathers, and of your own, turn this conflagration against the cityof your enemy, and destroy Fiden¾ by its own flames, which ye could notreclaim by your kindness. The blood of your ambassadors and colonistsand the desolation of your frontiers suggest this."" At the command ofthe dictator the whole line advanced; the firebrands that weredischarged are partly caught up; others are wrested by force: the armieson either side are now armed with fire. The master of the horse too, onhis part, introduces among the cavalry a new mode of fighting; hecommands his men to take the bridles off their horses: and he himself attheir head, putting spurs to his own, dashing forward, is carried by theunbridled steed into the midst of the fires: the other horses also beingurged on carry their riders with unrestrained speed against the enemy.The dust being raised and mixed with smoke excluded the light from theeyes of both men and horses. That appearance which had terrified thesoldiers, no longer terrified the horses. The cavalry therefore,wherever they penetrated, produced a heap of bodies like a ruin. A newshout then assailed their ears; and when this attracted the attention ofthe two armies looking with amazement at each other, the dictator criesout ""that his lieutenant-general and his men had attacked the enemy onthe rear:"" he himself, on the shout being renewed, advances against themwith redoubled vigour. When two armies, two different battles pressed onthe Etrurians, now surrounded, in front and rear, and there was now nomeans of flight back to their camp, nor to the mountains, where newenemies were ready to oppose them, and the horses, now freed from theirbridles, had scattered their riders in every direction, the principalpart of the Veientians make precipitately for the Tiber. Such of theFidenatians as survived, bend their course to the city of Fiden¾. Theirflight hurries them in their state of panic into the midst of slaughter;they are cut to pieces on the banks; others, when driven into the water,were carried off by the eddies; even those who could swim were weigheddown by fatigue, by their wounds, and by fright; a few out of the manymake their way across. The other party make their way through the campinto the city. In the same direction their impetuosity carries theRomans in pursuit; Quintius more especially, and with him those who hadjust come down from the mountain, being the soldiers who were freshestfor labour, because they had come up towards the close of theengagement."Book 4,Chapter 34,"These, after they entered the gate mixed with the enemy, make theirway to the walls, and raise from their summit a signal to their friendsof the town being taken. When the dictator saw this, (for he had nowmade his way into the deserted camp of the enemy,) he leads on thesoldiers, who were now anxious to disperse themselves in quest of booty,entertaining a hope of a greater spoil in the city, to the gate; andbeing admitted within the walls, he proceeds to the citadel, whither hesaw the crowds of fugitives hurrying. Nor was the slaughter in the cityless than in the battle; until, throwing down their arms, beggingnothing but their life, they surrendered to the dictator. The city andcamp are plundered. On the following day, one captive being allotted toeach horseman and centurion, and two to those whose valour had beenconspicuous, and the rest being sold by auction, the dictator in triumphled back to Rome his army victorious and enriched with spoil; and havingordered the master of the horse to resign his office, he immediatelyresigned his own on the sixteenth day (after he had obtained it);surrendering in peace that authority which he had received during warand trepidations. Some annals have reported that there was a navalengagement with the Veientians at Fiden¾, a thing as difficult as it wasincredible, the river even now not being broad enough for such apurpose; and at that time, as we learn from old writers, beingconsiderably narrower: except that perhaps in disputing the passage ofthe river, magnifying, as will happen, the scuffle of a few ships, theysought the empty honour of a naval victory."Book 4,Chapter 35,"The following year had as military tribunes with consular powerAulus Sempronius Atratinus, Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus, Lucius FuriusMedullinus, Lucius Horatius Barbatus. To the Veientians a truce fortwenty years was granted, and one for three years to the ®quans, thoughthey had solicited one for a longer term. There was quiet also from cityriots. The year following, though not distinguished either by war abroador by disturbance at home, was rendered celebrated by the games whichhad been vowed during the war, both through the magnificence displayedin them by the military tribunes, and also through the concourse of theneighbouring states. The tribunes with consular power were AppiusClaudius Crassus, Spurius Nautilus Rutilus, Lucius Sergius Fidenas,Sextus Julius Iulus. The exhibition, besides that they had come with thepublic concurrence of their states, was rendered still more grateful tothe strangers by the courtesy of their hosts. After the games seditiousharangues were delivered by the tribunes of the commons upbraiding themultitude; ""that stupified with admiration of those persons whom theyhated, they kept themselves in a state of eternal bondage; and they notonly had not the courage to aspire to the recovery of their hopes of ashare in the consulship, but even in the electing of military tribunes,which elections lay open to both patricians and commons, they neitherthought of themselves nor of their party. That they must therefore ceasefeeling surprised why no one busied himself about the interests of thecommons: that labour and danger would be expended on objects whenceemolument and honour might be expected. That there was nothing men wouldnot attempt if great rewards were proposed for those who make greatattempts. That any tribune of the commons should rush blindly at greatrisk and with no advantage into contentions, in consequence of which hemay rest satisfied that the patricians against whom he should strive,will persecute him with inexpiable war, whilst with the commons in whosebehalf he may have contended he will not be one whit the more honoured,was a thing neither to be expected nor required. That by great honoursminds became great. That no plebeian would think meanly of himself, whenthey ceased to be despised by others. That the experiment should be atlength made in the case of one or two, whether there were any plebeiancapable of sustaining a high dignity, or whether it were next to amiracle and a prodigy that any one sprung from the commons should be abrave and industrious man. That by the utmost energy the point had beengained, that military tribunes with consular power might be chosen fromamong the commons also. That men well approved both in the civil andmilitary line had stood as candidates. That during the first years theywere hooted at, rejected, and ridiculed by the patricians: that atlength they had ceased to expose themselves to insult. Nor did he forhis part see why the law itself might not be repealed; by which that wasmade lawful which never could take place; for that there would be lesscause for blushing at the injustice of the law, than if they were to bepassed over through their own want of merit."""Book 4,Chapter 36,"Harangues of this kind, listened to with approbation, induced somepersons to stand for the military tribuneship, each avowing that if inoffice he would propose something to the advantage of the commons. Hopeswere held out of a distribution of the public land, of colonies to beplanted, and of money to be raised for the pay of the soldiers, by a taximposed on the proprietors of estates. Then an opportunity was laidhold of by the military tribunes, so that during the absence of mostpersons from the city, when the patricians who were to be recalled by aprivate intimation were to attend on a certain day, a decree of thesenate might be passed in the absence of the tribunes of the commons;that a report existed that the Volscians had gone forth into the landsof Hernici to commit depredations, the military tribunes were to set outto examine into the matter, and that an assembly should be held for theelection of consuls. Having set out, they leave Appius Claudius, son ofthe decemvir, as prefect of the city, a young man of great energy, andone who had ever from his cradle imbibed a hatred of the tribunes andthe commons. The tribunes of the commons had nothing for which theyshould contend, either with those persons now absent, who had procuredthe decree of the senate, nor with Appius, the matter being now allover."Book 4,Chapter 37,"Caius Sempronius Atratinus, Quintus Fabius Vibulanus were electedconsuls. An affair in a foreign country, but one deserving of record, isstated to have happened in that year. Vulturnum, a city of theEtrurians, which is now Capua, was taken by the Samnites; and was calledCapua from their leader, Capys, or, what is more probable, from itschampaign grounds. But they took possession of it, after having beenadmitted into a share of the city and its lands, when the Etrurians hadbeen previously much harassed in war; afterwards the new-comers attackedand massacred during the night the old inhabitants, when on a festivalday they had become heavy with wine and sleep. After those transactionsthe consuls whom we have mentioned entered on office on the ides ofDecember. Now not only those who had been expressly sent, reported thata Volscian war was impending; but ambassadors also from the Latins andHernicians brought word, ""that never at any former period were theVolscians more intent either in selecting commanders, or in levying anarmy; that they commonly observed either that arms and war were to befor ever consigned to oblivion, and the yoke to be submitted to; or thatthey must not yield to those, with whom they contended for empire,either in valour, perseverance, or military discipline."" The accountsthey brought were not unfounded; but neither the senate were so muchaffected by the circumstance; and Caius Sempronius, to whom the provincefell by lot, relying on fortune, as if a most constant object, becausehe was the leader of a victorious state against one frequentlyvanquished, executed all his measures carelessly and remissly; so thatthere was more of the Roman discipline in the Volscian than in the Romanarmy. Success therefore, as on many other occasions, attended merit. Inthe first battle, which was entered on by Sempronius without eitherprudence or caution, they met, without their lines being strengthened byreserves, or their cavalry being properly stationed. The shout was thefirst presage which way the victory would incline; that raised by theenemy was louder and more continued; that by the Romans, beingdissonant, uneven, and frequently repeated in a lifeless manner,betrayed the prostration of their spirits. The enemy advancing the moreboldly on this account, pushed with their shields, brandished theirswords; on the other side the helmets drooped, as the men looked around,and disconcerted they waver, and keep close to the main body. Theensigns at one time standing their ground are deserted by theirsupporters, at another time they retreat between their respectivecompanies. As yet there was no absolute flight, nor was there victory.The Romans rather covered themselves than fought. The Volsciansadvanced, pushed against their line, saw more of the enemy slain thanrunning away."Book 4,Chapter 38,"They now give way in every direction, the consul Sempronius in vainchiding and exhorting them; neither his authority nor his dignityavailed any thing; and they would presently have turned their backs tothe enemy, had not Sextus Tempanius, a commander of a troop of horse,with great presence of mind brought them support, when matters were nowdesperate. When he called out aloud, ""that the horsemen who wished forthe safety of the commonwealth should leap from their horses,"" thehorsemen of all the troops being moved, as if by the consul's orders, hesays, ""unless this cohort by its arms can stop the progress of theenemy, there is an end of the empire. Follow my spear as your standard.Show to the Romans and Volscians, that no cavalry are equal to you ascavalry, nor infantry to you as infantry."" When this exhortation wasapproved by a loud shout, he advances, holding his spear aloft. Whereverthey go, they open a passage for themselves; putting forward theirtargets they force on to the place where they saw the distress of theirfriends greatest. The fight is restored in every part, as far as theironset reached; nor was there a doubt but that if so few could,accomplish every thing at the same time, the enemy would have turnedtheir backs."Book 4,Chapter 39,"And when they could now be withstood in no part, the Volsciancommander gives a signal, that an opening should be made for thetargeteers, the enemy's new cohort; until carried away by theirimpetuosity they should be cut off from their own party. When this wasdone, the horsemen were intercepted; nor were they able to force theirway in the same direction as that through which they had passed; theenemy being thickest in that part through which they had made their way;and the consul and Roman legions, when they could no where see thatparty which had lately been a protection to the entire army, lest theenemy should cut down so many men of distinguished valour by cuttingthem off, push forward at all hazards. The Volscians, forming twofronts, sustained the attack of the consul and the legions on the onehand, with the other front pressed on Tempanius and the horsemen: andwhen they after repeated attempts were unable to force their way totheir own party, they took possession of an eminence, and defendedthemselves by forming a circle, not without taking vengeance on theirenemies. Nor was there an end of the battle before night. The consulalso, never relaxing his efforts as long as any light remained, kept theenemy employed. The night at length separated them undecided as tovictory; and such a panic seized both camps, from their uncertainty asto the issue, that, leaving behind their wounded and a great part of thebaggage, both armies, as if vanquished, betook themselves to theadjoining mountains. The eminence, however, continued to be besiegedtill beyond midnight; but when word was brought to the besiegers thatthe camp was deserted, supposing that their own party had been defeated,they too fled, each whithersoever his fears carried him in the dark.Tempanius, through fear of an ambush, detained his men till daylight.Then having himself descended with a few men to look about, when heascertained by inquiring from some of the wounded enemy that the camp ofthe Volscians was deserted, he joyously calls down his men from theeminence, and makes his way into the Roman camp: where, when he foundevery thing waste and deserted, and the same unsightliness as with theenemy, before the discovery of this mistake should bring back theVolscians, taking with him all the wounded he could, and not knowingwhat route the consul had taken, he proceeds by the shortest roads tothe city."Book 4,Chapter 40,"The report of the unsuccessful battle and of the abandonment of thecamp had already reached there; and, above all other objects, thehorsemen were mourned not more with private than with public grief; andthe consul Fabius, the city also being now alarmed, stationed guardsbefore the gates; when the horsemen, seen at a distance, not withoutsome degree of terror by those who doubted who they were, but soon beingrecognised, from a state of dread produced such joy, that a shoutpervaded the city, of persons congratulating each other on the horsemenhaving returned safe and victorious; and from the houses a little beforein mourning, as they had given up their friends for lost, persons wereseen running into the street; and the affrighted mothers and wives,forgetful of all ceremony through joy, ran out to meet the band, eachone rushing up to her own friends, and through extravagance of delightscarcely retaining power over body or mind. The tribunes of the peoplewho had appointed a day of trial for Marcus Postumius and TitusQuintius, because of the unsuccessful battle fought near Veii by theirmeans, thought that an opportunity now presented itself for renewing thepublic odium against them by reason of the recent displeasure feltagainst the consul Sempronius. Accordingly, a meeting being convened,when they exclaimed aloud that the commonwealth had been betrayed atVeii by the generals, that the army was afterwards betrayed by theconsul in the country of the Volscians, because they had escaped withimpunity, that the very brave horsemen were consigned to slaughter, thatthe camp was shamefully deserted; Caius Julius, one of the tribunes,ordered the horseman Tempanius to be cited, and in presence of them hesays, ""Sextus Tempanius, I ask of you, whether do you think that CaiusSempronius the consul either commenced the battle at the proper time, orstrengthened his line with reserves, or that he discharged any duty of agood consul? or did you yourself, when the Roman legions were beaten, ofyour own judgment dismount the cavalry and restore the fight? then whenyou and the horsemen with you were cut off from our army, did either theconsul himself come to your relief, or did he send you succour? Thenagain, on the following day, had you any assistance any where? or didyou and your cohort by your own bravery make your way into your camp?Did you find a consul or an army in the camp, or did you find the campforsaken, the wounded soldiers left behind? These things are to bedeclared by you this day, as becomes your valour and honour, by whichalone the republic has stood its ground on this day. In a word, where isCaius Sempronius, where are our legions? Have you been deserted, or haveyou deserted the consul and the army? In a word, have we been defeated,or have we gained the victory?"""Book 4,Chapter 41,"In answer to these questions the language of Tempanius is said tohave been entirely devoid of elegance, but firm as became a soldier, notvainly parading his own merits, nor exulting in the inculpation ofothers: ""How much military skill Caius Sempronius possessed, that it wasnot his business as a soldier to judge with respect to his commander,but the business of the Roman people when they were choosing consuls atthe election. Wherefore that they should not require from him a detailof the plans to be adopted by a general, nor of the qualifications to belooked for in a consul; which matters required to be considered by greatminds and great capacities; but what he saw, that he could state. Thatbefore he was separated from his own party, he saw the consul fightingin the first line, encouraging his men, actively employed amid the Romanensigns and the weapons of the enemy; that he was afterwards carried outof sight of his friends. That from the din and shouting he perceivedthat the contest was protracted till night; nor did he think itpossible, from the great numbers of the enemy, that they could forcetheir way to the eminence which he had seized on. Where the army mightbe, he did not know; he supposed that as he protected himself and hismen, by advantage of situation when in danger, in the same way theconsul, for the purpose of preserving his army, had selected a moresecure place for his camp. Nor did he think that the affairs of theVolscians were in a better condition than those of the Roman people.That fortune and the night had occasioned a multitude of mistakes onboth sides:"" and then when he begged that they would not detain him,fatigued with toil and wounds, he was dismissed with high encomiums, notmore on his bravery than his modesty. While these things were going on,the consul was at the temple of Rest on the road leading to Lavici.Waggons and other modes of conveyance were sent thither from the city,and took up the army, exhausted by the action and the travelling bynight. Soon after the consul entered the city, not more anxious toremove the blame from himself, than to bestow on Tempanius the praisesso well deserved. Whilst the citizens were still sorrowful inconsequence of their ill success, and incensed against their leaders,Marcus Postumius, being arraigned and brought before them, he who hadbeen military tribune with consular power at Veii, is condemned in afine of ten thousand _asses_ in weight, of brass. His colleague, TitusQuintius, who endeavoured to shift the entire blame of that period onhis previously condemned colleague, was acquitted by all the tribes,because both in the country of the Volscians, when consul, he hadconducted business successfully under the auspices of the dictator,Postumius Tubertus, and also at Fiden¾, as lieutenant-general of anotherdictator, Mamercus ®milius. The memory of his father, Cincinnatus, a manhighly deserving of veneration, is said to have been serviceable to him,as also Capitolinus Quintius, now advanced in years, humbly entreatingthat they would not suffer him who had so short a time to live to be thebearer of such dismal tidings to Cincinnatus."Book 4,Chapter 42,"The commons elected as tribunes of the people, though absent, SextusTempanius, Aulus Sellius, Sextus Antistius, and Spurius Icilius, whomthe horsemen by the advice of Tempanius had appointed to command them ascenturions. The senate, inasmuch as the name of consuls was now becomingdispleasing through the hatred felt towards Sempronius, ordered thatmilitary tribunes with consular power should be elected. Those electedwere Lucius Manlius Capitolinus, Quintus Antonius Merenda, LuciusPapirius Mugillanus. At the very commencement of the year, LuciusHortensius, a tribune of the people, appointed a day of trial for CaiusSempronius, a consul of the preceding year, and when his fourcolleagues, in sight of the Roman people, entreated him that he wouldnot involve in vexation their unoffending general, in whose casenothing but fortune could be blamed, Hortensius took offence, thinkingit to be a trying of his perseverance, and that the accused depended noton the entreaties of the tribunes, which were merely used for show, buton their protection. Therefore now turning to him, he asked, ""Where werethose patrician airs, where the spirit supported and confiding inconscious innocence; that a man of consular dignity took shelter underthe shade of the tribunes?"" Another time to his colleagues, ""What do youintend doing, if I go on with the prosecution; will you wrest theirjurisdiction from the people and overturn the tribunitian authority?""When they said that, ""both with respect to Sempronius and all others,the power of the Roman people was supreme; that they had neither thewill nor the power to do away with the judgment of the people; but iftheir entreaties for their commander, who was to them in the light of aparent, were to prove of no avail, that they would change their apparelalong with him:"" then Hortensius says, ""The commons of Rome shall notsee their tribunes in the garb of culprits. To Caius Sempronius I havenothing more to say, since when in office he has attained this goodfortune, to be so dear to his soldiers."" Nor was the dutiful attachmentof the four tribunes more grateful alike to the commons and patricians,than was the temper of Hortensius, which yielded so readily to theirjust entreaties. Fortune no longer indulged the ®quans, who had embracedthe doubtful victory of the Volscians as their own."Book 4,Chapter 43,"In the year following, when Numerius Fabius Vibulanus and TitusQuintius Capitolinus, son of Capitolinus, were consuls, nothing worthmentioning was performed under the conduct of Fabius, to whom thatprovince had fallen by lot. When the ®quans had merely showed theirdastardly army, they were routed by a shameful flight, without any greathonour to the consul; therefore a triumph is refused. However inconsequence of having effaced the ignominy of Sempronius's defeat, hewas allowed to enter the city with an ovation. As the war was terminatedwith less difficulty than they had apprehended, so in the city, from astate of tranquillity, an unexpected mass of dissensions arose betweenthe commons and patricians, which commenced with doubling the number ofqu¾stors. When the patricians approved most highly of this measure,(viz. that, besides the two city qu¾stors, two should attend theconsuls to discharge some duties of the military service,) after it wasmoved by the consuls, the tribunes of the commons contended inopposition to the consuls, that half of the qu¾stors should be appointedfrom the commons; for up to that time all patricians were appointed.Against this proceeding both the consuls and patricians at first strovewith all their might; then by making a concession that the will of thepeople should be equally free in the case of qu¾stors, as they enjoyedin the election of tribunes with consular power, when they produced butlittle effect, they gave up the entire matter about increasing thenumber of qu¾stors. When relinquished, the tribunes take it up, andother seditious schemes are continually started, among which is that ofthe agrarian law. On account of these disturbances the senate wasdesirous that consuls should be elected rather than tribunes, but nodecree of the senate could be passed in consequence of the protests ofthe tribunes; the government from being consular came to an interregnum,and not even that without a great struggle (for the tribunes preventedthe patricians from meeting). When the greater part of the followingyear was wasted in contentions by the new tribunes of the commons andsome interreges, the tribunes at one time hindering the patricians fromassembling to declare an interrex, at another time preventing theinterrex from passing a decree regarding the election of consuls; atlength Lucius Papirius Mugillanus, being nominated interrex, censuringnow the patricians, now the tribunes of the people, asserted ""that thestate, deserted and forsaken by man, being taken up by the providenceand care of the gods, subsisted by the Veientian truce and thedilatoriness of the ®quans. From which quarter if any alarm of danger beheard, did it please them that the state, left without a patricianmagistrate, should be taken by surprise? that there should be no army,nor general to enlist one? Will they repel a foreign war by an intestineone? And if they both meet, the Roman state can scarcely be saved, evenby the aid of the gods, from being overwhelmed. That they, by resigningeach a portion of their strict right, should establish concord by acompromise; the patricians, by suffering military tribunes with consularauthority to be elected; the tribunes of the commons, by ceasing toprotest against the four qu¾stors being elected promiscuously from thecommons and patricians by the free suffrage of the people."""Book 4,Chapter 44,"The election of tribunes was first held. There were chosen tribuneswith consular power, Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus a third time, LuciusFurius Medullinus a second time, Marcus Manlius, Aulus SemproniusAtratinus. On the last-named tribune presiding at the election ofqu¾stors, and among several other plebeians a son of Antistius, aplebeian tribune, and a brother of Sextus Pompilius, also a tribune ofthe commons, becoming candidates, neither the power nor interest of thelatter at all availed so as to prevent those, whose fathers andgrandfathers they had seen consuls, from being preferred for their highbirth. All the tribunes of the commons became enraged, above allPompilius and Antistius were incensed at the rejection of theirrelatives. ""What could this mean? that neither through their ownkindnesses, nor in consequence of the injurious treatment of thepatricians, nor even through the natural desire of making use of theirnew right, as that is now allowed which was not allowed before, was anyindividual of the commons elected if not a military tribune, not even aqu¾stor. That the prayers of a father in behalf of a son, those of onebrother in behalf of another, had been of no avail, though proceedingfrom tribunes of the people, a sacrosanct power created for the supportof liberty. There must have been some fraud in the matter, and AulusSempronius must have used more of artifice at the elections than wascompatible with honour."" They complained that by the unfairness of hisconduct their friends had been kept out of office. Accordingly as noattack could be made on him, secured by his innocence and by the officehe then held, they turned their resentment against Caius Sempronius,uncle to Atratinus; and, with the aid of their colleague MarcusCornelius, they entered a prosecution against him on account of thedisgrace sustained in the Volscian war. By the same tribunes mention wasfrequently made in the senate concerning the division of the lands,(which scheme Caius Sempronius had always most vigorously opposed,) theysupposing, as was really the case, that the accused, should he give upthe question, would become less valued among the patricians, or bypersevering up to the period of trial he would give offence to thecommons. He preferred to expose himself to the torrent of popularprejudice, and to injure his own cause, than to be wanting to the publiccause; and he stood firm in the same sentiment, ""that no largess shouldbe made, which was sure to turn to the benefit of the three tribunes;that it was not land was sought for the people, but odium for him. Thathe too would undergo that storm with a determined mind; nor shouldeither himself, nor any other citizen, be of so much consequence to thesenate, that in showing tenderness to an individual, a public injury maybe done."" When the day of trial came, he, having pleaded his own causewith a spirit by no means subdued, is condemned in a fine of fifteenthousand _asses_, though the patricians tried every means to make thepeople relent. The same year Postumia, a Vestal virgin, is tried for abreach of chastity, though guiltless of the charge; having fallen undersuspicion in consequence of her dress being too gay and her manners lessreserved than becomes a virgin, not avoiding the imputation withsufficient care. The case was first deferred, she was afterwardsacquitted; but the chief pontiff, by the instruction of the college,commanded her to refrain from indiscreet mirth, and to dress with moreregard to sanctity than elegance. In the same year Cum¾, a city whichthe Greeks then occupied, was taken by the Campanians."Book 4,Chapter 45,"The following year had for military tribunes with consular power,Agrippa Menenius Lanatus, Publius Lucretius Tricipitinus, SpuriusNautius Rutilus: to the good fortune of the Roman people, the year wasremarkable rather by great danger than by losses. The slaves conspire toset fire to the city in several quarters, and whilst the people shouldbe intent in bearing assistance to the houses in every direction, totake up arms and seize the citadel and Capitol. Jupiter frustrated theirhorrid designs; and the offenders, being seized on the information oftwo (accomplices), were punished. Ten thousand _asses_ in weight ofbrass paid out of the treasury, a sum which at that time was consideredwealth, and their freedom, was the reward conferred on the parties whodiscovered. The ®quans then began to prepare for a renewal ofhostilities; and an account was brought to Rome from good authority,that new enemies, the Lavicanians, were forming a coalition with the oldones. The state had now become habituated, as it were, to theanniversary arms of the ®quans. When ambassadors were sent to Laviciand brought back from thence an evasive answer, from which it becameevident that neither war was intended there, nor would peace be of longcontinuance, instructions were given to the Tusculans, that they shouldobserve attentively, lest any new commotion should arise at Lavici. Tothe military tribunes, with consular power, of the following year,Lucius Sergius Fidenas, Marcus Papirius Mugillanus, Caius Servilius theson of Priscus, in whose dictatorship Fiden¾ had been taken, ambassadorscame from Tusculum, just as they entered on their office. Theambassadors brought word that the Lavicanians had taken arms, and havingravaged the Tusculan territory in conjunction with the army of the®quans, that they had pitched their camp at Algidum. Then war wasproclaimed against the Lavicanians; and a decree of the senate havingbeen passed, that two of the tribunes should proceed to the war, andthat one should manage affairs at Rome, a contest suddenly sprung upamong the tribunes. Each represented himself as a fitter person to takethe lead in the war, and scorned the management of the city asdisagreeable and inglorious. When the senate beheld with surprise theindecent contention between the colleagues, Quintus Servilius says,""Since there is no respect either for this house, or for thecommonwealth, parental authority shall set aside this altercation ofyours. My son, without having recourse to lots, shall take charge of thecity. I wish that those who are so desirous of managing the war, mayconduct it with more consideration and harmony than they covet it."""Book 4,Chapter 46,"It was determined that the levy should not be made out of the entirebody of the people indiscriminately. Ten tribes were drawn by lot; thetwo tribunes enlisted the younger men out of these, and led them to thewar. The contentions which commenced between them in the city, were,through the same eager ambition for command, carried to a much greaterheight in the camp: on no one point did they think alike; they contendedstrenuously for their own opinion; they desired their own plans, theirown commands only to be ratified; they mutually despised each other, andwere despised, until, on the remonstrances of the lieutenant-generals,it was at length so arranged, that they should hold the supreme commandon alternate days. When an account of these proceedings was brought toRome, Quintus Servilius, taught by years and experience, is said tohave prayed to the immortal gods, that the discord of the tribunes mightnot prove more detrimental to the commonwealth than it had done at Veii:and, as if some certain disaster was impending over them, he pressed hisson to enlist soldiers and prepare arms. Nor was he a false prophet. Forunder the conduct of Lucius Sergius, whose day of command it was, beingsuddenly attacked by the ®quans on disadvantageous ground near theenemy's camp, after having been decoyed thither by the vain hope oftaking it, because the enemy had counterfeited fear and betakenthemselves to their rampart, they were beaten down a declivity, andgreat numbers were overpowered and slaughtered by their tumbling oneover the other rather than by flight: and the camp, retained withdifficulty on that day, was, on the following day, deserted by ashameful flight through the opposite gate, the enemy having invested itin several directions. The generals, lieutenant-generals, and such ofthe main body of the army as kept near the colours, made their way toTusculum; others, dispersed in every direction through the fields,hastened to Rome by different roads, announcing a heavier loss than hadbeen sustained. There was less of consternation, because the resultcorresponded to the apprehensions of persons; and because thereinforcements, which they could look to in this distressing state ofthings, had been prepared by the military tribune: and by his orders,after the disturbance in the city was quieted by the inferiormagistrates, scouts were instantly despatched, and brought intelligencethat the generals and the army were at Tusculum; that the enemy had notremoved their camp. And, what raised their spirits most, QuintusServilius Priscus was created dictator in pursuance of a decree of thesenate; a man whose judgment in public affairs the state had experiencedas well on many previous occasions, as in the issue of that war, becausehe alone had expressed his apprehensions of the result of the disputesamong the tribunes, before the occurrence of the misfortune; he havingappointed for his master of the horse, by whom, as military tribune, hehad been nominated dictator, his own son, as some have stated, (forothers mention that Ahala Servilius was master of the horse that year;)and setting out to the war with his newly-raised army, after sending forthose who were at Tusculum, chose ground for his camp at the distanceof two miles from the enemy."Book 4,Chapter 47,"The arrogance and negligence arising from success, which hadpreviously existed in the Roman generals, were now transferred to the®quans. Accordingly, when in the very first engagement the dictator hadthrown the enemy's van into disorder by a charge of his cavalry, heimmediately ordered the infantry to advance, and slew one of his ownstandard-bearers who hesitated in so doing. So great was the ardour tofight, that the ®quans did not stand the shock; and when, vanquished inthe field, they made for their camp in a precipitate flight, the takingof it was shorter in time and less in trouble than the battle had been.After the camp had been taken and plundered, and the dictator had givenup the spoil to the soldiers, and the cavalry, who had pursued the enemyin their flight, brought back intelligence that all the Lavicanians werevanquished, and that a considerable number of the ®quans had fled toLavici, the army was marched to Lavici on the following day; and thetown, being invested on all sides, was taken by storm and plundered. Thedictator, having marched back his victorious army to Rome, resigned hisoffice on the eighth day after he had been appointed; and beforeagrarian disturbances could be raised by the tribunes of the commons,allusion having been made to a division of the Lavicanian land, thesenate very opportunely voted in full assembly that a colony should beconducted to Lavici. One thousand five hundred colonists were sent fromthe city, and received each two acres. Lavici being taken, andsubsequently Agrippa Menenius Lanatus, and Lucius Servilius Structus,and Publius Lucretius Tricipitinus, all these a second time, and SpuriusRutilius Crassus being military tribunes with consular authority, and onthe following year Aulus Sempronius Atratinus a third time, and MarcusPapirius Mugillanus and Spurius Nautius Rutilus both a second time,affairs abroad were peaceable for two years, but at home there wasdissension from the agrarian laws."Book 4,Chapter 48,"The disturbers of the commons were Spurius M¾cilius a fourth time,and Spurius M¾tilius a third time, tribunes of the people, both electedduring their absence. And after they had proposed a bill, that the landtaken from the enemy should be divided man by man, and the property ofa considerable part of the nobles would be confiscated by such ameasure; for there was scarcely any of the land, considering the cityitself was built on a strange soil, that had not been acquired by arms;nor had any other persons except the commons possession of that whichhad been sold or publicly assigned, a violent contest between thecommons and patricians seemed to be at hand; nor did the militarytribunes discover either in the senate, or in the private meetings ofthe nobles, any line of conduct to pursue; when Appius Claudius, thegrandson of him who had been decemvir for compiling the laws, being theyoungest senator of the meeting, is stated to have said; ""that hebrought from home an old and a family scheme, for that hisgreat-grandfather, Appius Claudius, had shown the patricians one methodof baffling tribunitian power by the protests of their colleagues; thatmen of low rank were easily led away from their opinions by theinfluence of men of distinction, if language were addressed to themsuitable to the times, rather than to the dignity of the speakers. Thattheir sentiments were regulated by their circumstances. When they shouldsee that their colleagues, having the start in introducing the measure,had engrossed to themselves the whole credit of it with the commons, andthat no room was left for them, that they would without reluctanceincline to the interest of the senate, through which they may conciliatethe favour not only of the principal senators, but of the whole body.""All expressing their approbation, and above all, Quintius ServiliusPriscus eulogizing the youth, because he had not degenerated from theClaudian race, a charge is given, that they should gain over as many ofthe college of the tribunes as they could, to enter protests. On thebreaking up of the senate the tribunes are applied to by the leadingpatricians: by persuading, admonishing, and assuring them ""that it wouldbe gratefully felt by them individually, and gratefully by the entiresenate, they prevailed on six to give in their protests."" And on thefollowing day, when the proposition was submitted to the senate, as hadbeen preconcerted, concerning the sedition which M¾cilius and M¾tiliuswere exciting by urging a largess of a most mischievous precedent, suchspeeches were delivered by the leading senators, that each declared""that for his part he had no measure to advise, nor did he see anyother resource in any thing, except in the aid of the tribunes. That tothe protection of that power the republic, embarrassed as it was, fledfor succour, just as a private individual in distress. That it washighly honourable to themselves and to their office that there residednot in the tribuneship more strength to harass the senate and to excitedisunion among the several orders, than to resist their perversecolleagues."" Then a shout arose throughout the entire senate, when thetribunes were appealed to from all parts of the house: then silencebeing established, those who had been prepared through the interest ofthe leading men, declare that they will protest against the measurewhich had been proposed by their colleagues, and which the senateconsiders to tend to the dissolution of the state. Thanks were returnedto the protestors by the senate. The movers of the law, having conveneda meeting, and styling their colleagues traitors to the interests of thecommons and the slaves of the consulars, and after inveighing againstthem in other abusive language, relinquished the measure."Book 4,Chapter 49,"The following year, on which Publius Cornelius Cossus, CaiusValerius Potitus, Quintus Quintius Cincinnatus, Numerius FabiusVibulanus were military tribunes with consular power, would have broughtwith it two continual wars, had not the Veientian campaign been deferredby the religious scruples of the leaders, whose lands were destroyed,chiefly by the ruin of the country-seats, in consequence of the Tiberhaving overflowed its banks. At the same time the loss sustained threeyears before prevented the ®quans from affording assistance to theBolani, a state belonging to their own nation. Excursions had been madefrom thence on the contiguous territory of Lavici, and hostilities werecommitted on the new colony. As they had expected to be able to defendthis act of aggression by the concurrent support of all the ®quans, whendeserted by their friends they lost both their town and lands, after awar not even worth mentioning, through a siege and one slight battle. Anattempt made by Lucius Sextius, tribune of the people, to move a law bywhich colonists might be sent to Bol¾ also, in like manner as to Lavici,was defeated by the protests of his colleagues, who declared openly thatthey would suffer no order of the commons to be passed, unless with theapprobation of the senate. On the following year the ®quans, havingrecovered Bol¾, and sent a colony thither, strengthened the town withadditional fortifications, the military tribunes with consular power atRome being Cneius Cornelius Cossus, Lucius Valerius Potitus, QuintusFabius Vibulanus a second time, Marcus Postumius Regillensis. The waragainst the ®quans was intrusted to the latter, a man of depraved mind,which victory manifested more effectually than war. For having withgreat activity levied an army and marched it to Bol¾, after breakingdown the spirits of the ®quans in slight engagements, he at lengthforced his way into the town. He then turned the contest from the enemyto his countrymen; and when during the assault he had proclaimed, thatthe plunder should belong to the soldiers, after the town was taken hebroke his word. I am more inclined to believe that this was the cause ofthe displeasure of the army, than that in a city lately sacked and in acolony still young there was less booty found than the tribune hadrepresented. An expression of his heard in the assembly, which was verysilly and almost insane, after he returned into the city on being sentfor on account of some tribunitian disturbances, increased this badfeeling; on Sextus, a tribune of the commons, proposing an agrarian law,and at the same time declaring that he would also propose that colonistsshould be sent to Bol¾; for that those who had taken them by their armswere deserving that the city and lands of Bol¾ should belong to them, heexclaimed, ""Woe to my soldiers, if they are not quiet;"" which words,when heard, gave not greater offence to the assembly, than they did soonafter to the patricians. And the plebeian tribune being a sharp man andby no means devoid of eloquence, having found among his adversaries thishaughty temper and unbridled tongue, which by irritating and exciting hecould urge into such expressions as might prove a source of odium notonly to himself, but to his cause and to the entire body, he strove todraw Postumius into discussion more frequently than any of the collegeof military tribunes. Then indeed, after so brutal and inhuman anexpression, ""Romans,"" says he, ""do ye hear him threatening woe to hissoldiers as to slaves? Yet this brute will appear to you more deservingof so high an honour than those who send you into colonies, after havinggranted to you cities and lands; who provide a settlement for your oldage, who fight against such cruel and arrogant adversaries in defenceof your interests. Begin then to wonder why few persons now undertakeyour cause. What are they to expect from you? is it honours which yougive to your adversaries rather than to the champions of the Romanpeople. You felt indignant just now, on hearing an expression of thisman? What matters that, if you will prefer this man who threatens woe toyou, to those who are desirous to secure for you lands, settlements, andproperty?"""Book 4,Chapter 50,"This expression of Postumius being conveyed to the soldiers, excitedin the camp much greater indignation. ""Did the embezzler of the spoilsand the defrauder threaten woe also to the soldiers?"" Accordingly, whenthe murmur of indignation now became avowed, and the qu¾stor, PubliusSestius, thought that the mutiny might be quashed by the same violenceby which it had been excited; on his sending a lictor to one of thesoldiers who was clamorous, when a tumult and scuffle arose from thecircumstance, being struck with a stone he retired from the crowd; theperson who had given the blow, further observing with a sneer, ""That thequ¾stor got what the general had threatened to the soldiers."" Postumiusbeing sent for in consequence of the disturbance, exasperated everything by the severity of his inquiries and the cruelty of hispunishment. At last, when he set no bounds to his resentment, a crowdcollecting at the cries of those whom he had ordered to be put to deathunder a hurdle, he himself madly ran down from his tribunal to those whowere interrupting the execution. There, when the lictors, endeavouringto disperse them, as also the centurions, irritated the crowd, theirindignation burst forth to such a degree, that the military tribune wasoverwhelmed with stones by his own army. When an account was brought toRome of so heinous a deed, the military tribunes endeavouring to procurea decree of the senate for an inquiry into the death of their colleague,the tribunes of the people entered their protest. But that contentionbranched out of another subject of dispute; because the patricians hadbecome uneasy lest the commons, through dread of the inquiries andthrough resentment, might elect military tribunes from their own body:and they strove with all their might that consuls should be elected.When the plebeian tribunes did not suffer the decree of the senate topass, and when they also protested against the election of consuls, theaffair was brought to an interregnum. The victory was then on the sideof the patricians."Book 4,Chapter 51,"Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, interrex, presiding in the assembly, AulusCornelius Cossus, Lucius Furius Medullinus were elected consuls. Duringtheir office, at the commencement of the year, a decree of the senatewas passed that the tribunes should, at the earliest opportunity,propose to the commons an inquiry into the murder of Postumius, and thatthe commons should appoint whomsoever they thought proper to conduct theinquiry. The office is intrusted to the consuls by the commons with theconsent of the people at large, who, after having executed the task withthe utmost moderation and lenity by punishing only a few, who there aresufficient grounds for believing put a period to their own lives, stillcould not succeed so as to prevent the people from feeling the utmostdispleasure. ""That constitutions, which were enacted for theiradvantages, lay so long unexecuted; while a law passed in the mean timeregarding their blood and punishment was instantly put into executionand possessed full force."" This was a most seasonable time, after thepunishment of the mutiny, that the division of the territory of Bol¾should be presented as a soother to their minds; by which proceedingthey would have diminished their eagerness for an agrarian law, whichtended to expel the patricians from the public land unjustly possessedby them. Then this very indignity exasperated their minds, that thenobility persisted not only in retaining the public lands, which theygot possession of by force, but would not even distribute to the commonsthe unoccupied land lately taken from the enemy, and which would, likethe rest, soon become the prey of a few. The same year the legions wereled out by the consul Furius against the Volscians, who were ravagingthe country of the Hernicians, and finding no enemy there, they tookFerentinum, whither a great multitude of the Volscians had betakenthemselves. There was less plunder than they had expected; because theVolscians, seeing small hopes of keeping it, carried off their effectsand abandoned the town. It was taken on the following day, being nearlydeserted. The land itself was given to the Hernicians."Book 4,Chapter 52,"The year, tranquil through the moderation of the tribunes, wassucceeded by one in which Lucius Icilius was plebeian tribune, QuintusFabius Ambustus, Caius Furius Pacilus being consuls. When this man, atthe very commencement of the year, began to excite disturbances by thepublication of agrarian laws, as if such was the task of his name andfamily, a pestilence broke out, more alarming however than deadly, whichdiverted men's thoughts from the forum and political disputes to theirdomestic concerns and the care of their personal health; and personsthink that it was less mischievous than the disturbance would haveproved. The state being freed from this (which was attended) with a verygeneral spread of illness, though very few deaths, the year ofpestilence was followed by a scarcity of grain, the cultivation of theland having been neglected, as usually happens, Marcus PapiriusAtratinus, Caius Nautius Rutilus being consuls. The famine would nowhave proved more dismal than the pestilence, had not the scarcity beenrelieved by sending envoys around all the states, which border on theTuscan Sea and the Tiber, to purchase the corn. The envoys wereprevented from trading in an insolent manner by the Samnitians, who werein possession of Capua and Cum¾; on the contrary, they were kindlyassisted by the tyrants of Sicily. The Tiber brought down the greatestsupplies, through the very active zeal of the Etrurians. In consequenceof the sickness, the consuls laboured under a paucity of hands inconducting the government; when not finding more than one senator foreach embassy, they were obliged to attach to it two knights. Except fromthe pestilence and the scarcity, there was no internal or externalannoyance during those two years. But as soon as these causes of anxietydisappeared, all those evils by which the state had hitherto beendistressed, started up, discord at home, war abroad."Book 4,Chapter 53,"In the consulship of Mamercus ®milius and Caius Valerius Potitus,the ®quans made preparations for war; the Volscians, though not bypublic authority, taking up arms, and entering the service as volunteersfor pay. When on the report of these enemies having started up, (forthey had now passed into the Latin and Hernican land,) Marcus M¾nius, aproposer of an agrarian law, would obstruct Valerius the consul whenholding a levy, and when no one took the military oath against his ownwill under the protection of the tribune; an account is suddenly broughtthat the citadel of Carventa had been seized by the enemy. The disgraceincurred by this event was both a source of odium to M¾nius in the handsof the fathers, and it moreover afforded to the other tribunes, alreadypre-engaged as protestors against an agrarian law, a more justifiablepretext for resisting their colleague. Wherefore after the matter hadbeen protracted for a long time by wrangling, the consuls calling godsand men to witness, that whatever disgrace or loss had either beenalready sustained or hung over them from the enemy, the blame of itwould be imputed to M¾nius, who hindered the levy; M¾nius, on the otherhand, exclaiming ""that if the unjust occupiers would yield up possessionof the public land, he would cause no delay to the levy:"" the ninetribunes interposing a decree, put an end to the contest; and theyproclaimed as the determination of their college, ""that they would, forthe purposes of the levy, in opposition to the protest of theircolleague, afford their aid to Caius Valerius the consul in inflictingfines and other penalties on those who refused to enlist."" When theconsul, armed with this decree, ordered into prison a few who appealedto the tribune, the rest took the military oath from fear. The army wasmarched to the citadel of Carventa, and though hated by and dislikingthe consul, they on their first arrival recovered the citadel in aspirited manner, having dislodged those who were protecting it; some inquest of plunder having straggled away through carelessness from thegarrison, afforded an opportunity for attacking them. There wasconsiderable booty from the constant devastations, because all had beencollected into a safe place. This the consul ordered the qu¾stors tosell by auction and carry it into the treasury, declaring that the armyshould then participate in the booty, when they had not declined theservice. The exasperation of the commons and soldiers against the consulwas then augmented. Accordingly, when by a decree of the senate theconsul entered the city in an ovation, rude verses in couplets werethrown out with military licence; in which the consul was severelyhandled, whilst the name of M¾nius was cried up with encomiums, when atevery mention of the tribune the attachment of the surrounding peoplevied by their applause and commendation with the loud praises of thesoldiers. And that circumstance occasioned more anxiety to thepatricians, than the wanton raillery of the soldiers against theconsul, which was in a manner a usual thing; and the election of M¾niusamong the military tribunes being deemed as no longer questionable, ifhe should become a candidate, he was kept out of it by an election forconsuls being appointed."Book 4,Chapter 54,"Cneius Cornelius Cossus and Lucius Furius Medullinus were electedconsuls. The commons were not on any other occasion more dissatisfied atthe election of tribunes not being conceded to them. This sense ofannoyance they both manifested at the nomination of qu¾stors, andavenged by then electing plebeians for the first time as qu¾stors; sothat in electing four, room was left for only one patrician; whilstthree plebeians, Quintus Silius, Publius Aelius, and Publius Pupius,were preferred to young men of the most illustrious families. I learnthat the principal advisers of the people, in this so independent abestowing of their suffrage, were the Icilii, three out of this familymost hostile to the patricians having been elected tribunes of thecommons for that year, by their holding out the grand prospect of manyand great achievements to the people, who became consequently mostardent; after they had affirmed that they would not stir a step, if thepeople would not, even at the election of qu¾stors, the only one whichthe senate had left open to the commons and patricians, evincesufficient spirit to accomplish that which they had so long wished for,and which was allowed by the laws. This therefore the people consideredan important victory; and that qu¾storship they estimated not by theextent of the honour itself; but an access seemed opened to new men tothe consulship and the honours of a triumph. The patricians, on theother hand, expressed their indignation not so much at the honours ofthe state being shared, but at their being lost; they said that, ""ifmatters be so, children need no longer be educated; who being drivenfrom the station of their ancestors, and seeing others in the possessionof their dignity, would be left without command or power, as mere saliiand flamens, with no other employment than to offer sacrifices for thepeople."" The minds of both parties being irritated, since the commonshad both assumed new courage, and had now three leaders of the mostdistinguished reputation for the popular side; the patricians seeingthat the result of all the elections would be similar to that forqu¾stors, wherever the people had the choice from both sides, strovevigorously for the election of consuls, which was not yet open to them.The Icilii, on the contrary, said that military tribunes should beelected, and that posts of honour should be at length imparted to thecommons."Book 4,Chapter 55,"But the consuls had no proceeding on hand, by opposing which theycould extort that which they desired; when by an extraordinary andfavourable occurrence an account is brought that the Volscians and®quans had proceeded beyond their frontiers into the Latin and Hernicanterritory to commit depredations. For which war when the consulscommence to hold a levy in pursuance of a decree of the senate, thetribunes then strenuously opposed them, affirming that such a fortunateopportunity was presented to them and to the commons. There were three,and all very active men, and of respectable families, considering theywere plebeians. Two of them choose each a consul, to be watched by themwith unremitting assiduity; to one is assigned the charge sometimes ofrestraining, sometimes of exciting, the commons by his harangues.Neither the consuls effected the levy, nor the tribunes the electionwhich they desired. Then fortune inclining to the cause of the people,expresses arrive that the ®quans had attacked the citadel of Carventa,the soldiers who were in garrison having straggled away in quest ofplunder, and had put to death the few left to guard it; that others wereslain as they were returning to the citadel, and others who weredispersed through the country. This circumstance, prejudicial to thestate, added force to the project of the tribunes. For, assailed byevery argument to no purpose that they would then at length desist fromobstructing the war, when they yielded neither to the public storm, norto the odium themselves, they succeed so far as to have a decree of thesenate passed for the election of military tribunes; with an expressstipulation, however, that no candidate should be considered, who wastribune of the people that year, and that no one should be re-electedplebeian tribune for the year following; the senate undoubtedly pointingat the Icilians, whom they suspected of aiming at the consulartribuneship as the reward of their turbulent tribuneship of the commons.Then the levy began to proceed, and preparations for war began to bemade with the concurrence of all ranks. The diversity of the statementsof writers leaves it uncertain whether both the consuls set out for thecitadel of Carventa, or whether one remained behind to hold theelections; those facts in which they do not disagree are to be receivedas certain, that they retired from the citadel of Carventa, after havingcarried on the attack for a long time to no purpose: that Verrugo in theVolscian country was taken by the same army, and that great devastationhad been made, and considerable booty captured both amongst the ®quansand in the Volscian territory."Book 4,Chapter 56,"At Rome, as the commons gained the victory so far as to have thekind of elections which they preferred, so in the issue of the electionsthe patricians were victorious; for, contrary to the expectation of all,three patricians were elected military tribunes with consular power,Caius Julius Julus, Publius Cornelius Cossus, Caius Servilius Ahala.They say that an artifice was employed by the patricians (with which theIcilii charged them even at the time); that by intermixing a crowd ofunworthy candidates with the deserving, they turned away the thoughts ofthe people from the plebeian through the disgust excited by theremarkable meanness of some. Then tidings are brought that the Volsciansand ®quans, whether the retention of the citadel of Carventa raisedtheir hopes, or the loss of the garrison at Verrugo excited theirresentment, united in making preparations for war with the utmostenergy: that the Antians were the chief promoters of the project; thattheir ambassadors had gone about the states of both these nations,upbraiding their dastardly conduct; that shut up within their walls,they had on the preceding year suffered the Romans to carry theirdepredations throughout their country, and the garrison of Verrugo to beoverpowered. That now not only armed troops but colonies also were sentinto their territories; and that not only the Romans distributed amongthemselves and kept their property, but that they had made a present tothe Hernici of Ferentinum what had been taken from them. After theirminds were inflamed by these remonstrances, according as they madeapplications to each, a great number of young men were enlisted. Thusthe youth of all the states were drawn together to Antium: there theypitched their camp and awaited the enemy. When these accounts arereported at Rome with much greater alarm than the circumstancewarranted, the senate instantly ordered a dictator to be nominated,which was their last resource in perilous circumstances. They say thatJulius and Cornelius were much offended at this proceeding, and that thematter was accomplished with great warmth of temper: when the leadingmen of the patricians, complaining fruitlessly that the militarytribunes would not conform to the judgment of the senate, at lastappealed even to the tribunes of the commons, and stated that force hadbeen used even with the consuls by that body on a similar occasion. Theplebeian tribunes, overjoyed at the dissension among the patricians,said, ""that there was no support in persons who were not held in therank of citizens, nor even of human beings; if ever the posts of honourwere open, and the administration of government were shared, that theyshould then see that the decrees of the senate should not be invalidatedby the arrogance of magistrates; that in the mean while, the patricians,unrestrained as they were by respect for laws or magistrates, mustmanage the tribunitian office also by themselves."""Book 4,Chapter 57,"This contention occupied men's thoughts at a most unseasonable time,when a war of such importance was on hand: until when Julius andCornelius descanted for a long time by turns, on ""how unjust it was thata post of honour conferred on them by the people was now to be wrestedfrom them, since they were generals sufficiently qualified to conductthat war."" Then Ahala Servilius, military tribune, says, ""that he hadremained silent for so long a time, not because he was uncertain as tohis opinion, (for what good citizen can separate his own interests fromthose of the public,) but because he wished that his colleagues shouldof their own accord yield to the authority of the senate, rather thansuffer the tribunitian power to be suppliantly appealed to against them.That even then, if circumstances permitted, he would still give themtime to retract an opinion too pertinaciously adhered to. But since theexigences of war do not await the counsels of men, that the public wealwas of deeper importance to him than the good will of his colleagues,and if the senate continued in the same sentiments, he would, on thefollowing night, nominate a dictator; and if any one protested against adecree of the senate being passed, that he would be content with itsauthority.""[158] When by this conduct he bore away the well-meritedpraises and good will of all, having named Publius Cornelius dictator,he himself being appointed by him as master of the horse, served as aninstance to those who considered his case and that of his colleagues,how much more attainable public favour and honour sometimes were tothose who evinced no desire for them. The war was in no respect amemorable one. The enemy were beaten at Antium in one, and that an easybattle; the victorious army laid waste the Volscian territory; theirfort at the lake Fucinus was taken by storm, and in it three thousandmen made prisoners; the rest of the Volscians being driven within thewalls, and not defending the lands. The dictator having conducted thewar in such a manner as to show that he was not negligent of fortune'sfavours, returned to the city with a greater share of success than ofglory, and resigned his office. The military tribunes, without makingany mention of an election of consuls, (through pique, I suppose, forthe appointment of a dictator,) issued a proclamation for the electionof military tribunes. Then indeed the perplexity of the patriciansbecame still greater, as seeing their cause betrayed by their own party.Wherefore, as on the year before, by bringing forward as candidates themost unworthy individuals from amongst the plebeians, they produced adisgust against all, even those who were deserving; so then by engagingsuch of the patricians as were most distinguished by the splendour oftheir character and by their influence to stand as candidates, theysecured all the places; so that no plebeian could get in. Four wereelected, all of them men who had already served the office, LuciusFurius Medullinus, Caius Valerius Potitus, Numerius Fabius Vibulanus,Caius Servilius Ahala. The last had the honour continued to him byre-election, as well in consequence of his other deserts, as on accountof his recent popularity, acquired by his singular moderation."Book 4,Chapter 58,"In that year, because the term of the truce with the Veientiannation was expired, restitution began to be demanded through ambassadorsand heralds, who on coming to the frontiers were met by an embassy fromthe Veientians. They requested that they would not proceed to Veii,until they should first have access to the Roman senate. They obtainedfrom the senate, that, because the Veientians were distressed byintestine dissension, restitution would not be demanded from them; sofar were they from seeking, in the troubles of others, an opportunityfor advancing their own interest. In the Volscian territory also adisaster was sustained in the loss of the garrison at Verrugo; where somuch depended on time, that when the soldiers who were besieged there,and were calling for succour, might have been relieved, if expeditionhad been used, the army sent to their aid only came in time to surprisethe enemy, who were straggling in quest of plunder, just after theirputting [the garrison] to the sword. The cause of the dilatoriness wasless referrible to the tribunes than to the senate, who, because wordwas brought that they were holding out with the most vigorousresistance, did not duly reflect that there is a limit to humanstrength, which no bravery can exceed. These very gallant soldiers,however, were not without revenge, both before and after their death. Inthe following year, Publius and Cneius Cornelius Cossus, Numerius FabiusAmbustus, and Lucius Valerius Potitus, being military tribunes withconsular power, the Veientian war was commenced on account of aninsolent answer of the Veientian senate, who, when the ambassadorsdemanded restitution, ordered them to be told, that if they did notspeedily quit the city and the territories, they should give them whatLars Tolumnius had given them. The senate, indignant at this, decreedthat the military tribunes should, on as early a day as possible,propose to the people the proclaiming war against the Veientians. Whenthis was first made public, the young men expressed theirdissatisfaction. ""That the war with the Volscians was not yet over; thata little time ago two garrisons were utterly destroyed, and that [one ofthe forts] was with great risk retained. That there was not a year inwhich they had not to fight in the field: and, as if they weredissatisfied at the insufficiency of these toils, a new war was now seton foot with a neighbouring and most powerful nation, who were likely torouse all Etruria."" These discontents, first discussed among themselves,were further aggravated by the plebeian tribunes. These constantlyaffirm that the war of the greatest moment was that between thepatricians and commons. That the latter was designedly harassed bymilitary service, and exposed to be butchered by the enemy; that theywere kept at a distance from the enemy, and as it were banished, lestduring the enjoyment of rest at home, mindful of liberty and ofestablishing colonies, they may form plans for obtaining some of thepublic land, or for giving their suffrages freely; and taking hold ofthe veterans, they recounted the campaigns of each, and their wounds andscars, frequently asking what sound spot was there on their body for thereception of new wounds? what blood had they remaining which could beshed for the commonwealth? When by discussing these subjects in privateconversations, and also in public harangues, they produced in the peoplean aversion to undertaking a war, the time for proposing the law wasadjourned; which would obviously have been rejected, if it had beensubjected to the feeling of discontent then prevailing."Book 4,Chapter 59,"In the mean time it was determined that the military tribunes shouldlead an army into the Volscian territory. Cneius Cornelius alone wasleft at Rome. The three tribunes, when it became evident that theVolscians had not established a camp any where, and that they would notventure an engagement, separated into three different parties to laywaste the country. Valerius makes for Antium, Cornelius for Ecetr¾.Wherever they came, they committed extensive devastations on the housesand lands, so as to separate the Volscians: Fabius, without committingany devastation, proceeded to attack Auxur, which was a principal objectin view. Auxur is the town now called Tarracin¾; a city built on adeclivity leading to a morass: Fabius made a feint of attacking it onthat side. When four cohorts sent round under Caius Servilius Ahala tookpossession of a hill which commanded the city, they attacked the wallswith a loud shout and tumult, from the higher ground where there was noguard of defence. Those who were defending the lower parts of the cityagainst Fabius, astounded at this tumult, afforded him an opportunity ofapplying the scaling ladders, and every place soon became filled withthe enemy, and a dreadful slaughter continued for a long time,indiscriminately of those who fled and those who resisted, of the armedor unarmed. The vanquished were therefore obliged to fight, there beingno hope for those who gave way, when a proclamation suddenly issued,that no persons except those with arms in their hands should be injured,induced all the remaining multitude voluntarily to lay down their arms;of whom two thousand five hundred are taken alive. Fabius kept hissoldiers from the spoil, until his colleagues should come; affirmingthat Auxur had been taken by these armies also, who had diverted theother Volscian troops from the defence of that place. When they came,the three armies plundered the town, which was enriched with wealth ofmany years' accumulation; and this generosity of the commanders firstreconciled the commons to the patricians. It was afterwards added, by aliberality towards the people on the part of the leading men the mostseasonable ever shown, that before any mention should be made of it bythe commons or tribunes, the senate should decree that the soldiersshould receive pay out of the public treasury, whereas up to that periodevery one had discharged that duty at his own expense."Book 4,Chapter 60,"It is recorded that nothing was ever received by the commons with somuch joy; that they ran in crowds to the senate-house, and caught thehands of those coming out, and called them fathers indeed; acknowledgingthat the result of such conduct was that no one would spare his personor his blood, whilst he had any strength remaining, in defence of acountry so liberal. Whilst the prospect of advantage pleased them, thattheir private property should remain unimpaired at the time during whichtheir bodies should be devoted and employed for the interest of thecommonwealth, it further increased their joy very much, and renderedtheir gratitude for the favour more complete, because it had beenoffered to them voluntarily, without ever having been agitated by thetribunes of the commons, or made the subject of a demand in their ownconversations. The tribunes of the commons, the only parties who did notparticipate in the general joy and harmony prevailing through thedifferent ranks, denied ""that this measure would prove so much a matterof joy, or so honourable to the patricians,[159] as they themselvesmight imagine. That the measure at first sight was better than it wouldprove by experience. For from what source was that money to be raised,except by levying a tax on the people. That they were generous to sometherefore at the expense of others; and even though others may endureit, those who had already served out their time in the service, wouldnever endure that others should serve on better terms than theythemselves had served; and that these same individuals should have tobear the expense of their own service, and then that of others."" Bythese arguments they influenced a part of the commons. At last, when thetax was now announced, the tribunes publicly declared, that they wouldafford protection to any one who should refuse to contribute hisproportion for the pay of the soldiers. The patricians persisted insupporting a matter so happily commenced. They themselves were the firstto contribute; and because there was as yet no coined silver, some ofthem conveying their weighed brass to the treasury in waggons, renderedtheir contribution very showy. After the senate had contributed with theutmost punctuality according to their rated properties, the principalplebeians, friends of the nobility, according to a concerted plan, beganto contribute. And when the populace saw these men highly applauded bythe patricians, and also looked up to as good citizens by men of themilitary age, scorning the support of the tribunes, an emulationcommenced at once about paying the tax. And the law being passed aboutdeclaring war against the Veientians, the new military tribunes withconsular power marched to Veii an army consisting in a great measure ofvolunteers."Book 4,Chapter 61,"The tribunes were Titus Quintius Capitolinus, Publius QuintiusCincinnatus, Caius Julius Julus a second time, Aulus Manlius, LuciusFurius Medullinus a second time, and Manius ®milius Mamercinus. By theseVeii was first invested. A little before the commencement of this siege,when a full meeting of the Etrurians was held at the temple of Voltumna,it was not finally determined whether the Veientians were to besupported by the public concurrence of the whole confederacy. The siegewas less vigorous in the following year, some of the tribunes and theirarmy being called off to the Volscian war. The military tribunes withconsular power in this year were Caius Valerius Potitus a third time,Manius Largius Fidenas, Publius Cornelius Maluginensis, Cneius CorneliusCossus, K¾so Fabius Ambustus, Spurius Nautius Rutilus a second time. Apitched battle was fought with the Volscians between Ferentinum andEcetra; the result of the battle was favourable to the Romans. Artenathen, a town of the Volscians, began to be besieged by the tribunes.Thence during an attempt at a sally, the enemy being driven back intothe town, an opportunity was afforded to the Romans of forcing in; andevery place was taken except the citadel. Into the fortress, wellprotected by nature, a body of armed men retired. Beneath the fortressmany were slain and made prisoners. The citadel was then besieged; norcould it either be taken by storm, because it had a garrison sufficientfor the size of the place, nor did it hold out any hope of surrender,all the public corn having been conveyed to the citadel before the citywas taken; and they would have retired from it, being wearied out, hadnot a slave betrayed the fortress to the Romans: the soldiers beingadmitted by him through a place difficult of access, took it; by whomwhen the guards were being killed, the rest of the multitude,overpowered with sudden panic, surrendered. After demolishing both thecitadel and city of Artena, the legions were led back from the Volscianterritory; and the whole Roman power was turned against Veii. To thetraitor, besides his freedom, the property of two families was given asa reward. His name was Servius Romanus. There are some who think thatArtena belonged to the Veientians, not to the Volscians. What occasionsthe mistake is that there was a city of the same name between C¾re andVeii. But the Roman kings destroyed it; and it belonged to theC¾retians, not to the Veientians. The other of the same name, thedemolition of which has been mentioned, was in the Volscian territory."Book 5,Chapter 1,"Peace being established in every other quarter, the Romans andVeientians were still in arms with such rancour and animosity, that itwas evident that ruin awaited the vanquished party. The elections in thetwo states were conducted in very different methods. The Romansaugmented the number of military tribunes with consular power. Eight, anumber greater than on any previous occasion, were appointed, Manius®milius Mamercinus a second time, Lucius Valerius Potitus a third time,Appius Claudius Crassus, Marcus Quintilius Varus, Lucius Julius Iulus,Marcus Postumius, Marcus Furius Camillus, Marcus Postumius Albinus. TheVeientians, on the contrary, through disgust at the annual intriguingwhich was sometimes the cause of dissensions, elected a king. That stepgave offence to the feelings of the states of Etruria, not more fromtheir hatred of kingly government than of the king himself. He hadbefore this become obnoxious to the nation by reason of his wealth andarrogance, because he had violently broken off the performance of someannual games, the omission of which was deemed an impiety: when throughresentment of a repulse, because another had been preferred to him as apriest by the suffrages of the twelve states, he suddenly carried off,in the middle of the performance, the performers, of whom a great partwere his own slaves. The nation, therefore, devoted beyond all others toreligious performances, because they excelled in the method ofconducting them, passed a decree that aid should be refused to theVeientians, as long as they should be subject to a king. All allusion tothis decree was suppressed at Veii through fear of the king, who wouldhave considered the person by whom any such matter might be mentioned asa leader of sedition, not as the author of an idle rumour. Althoughmatters were announced to the Romans as being quiet in Etruria, yetbecause it was stated that this matter was being agitated in all theirmeetings, they so managed their fortifications, that there should besecurity on both sides; some were directed towards the city and thesallies of the townsmen; by means of others a front looking towardsEtruria was opposed to such auxiliaries as might happen to come fromthence."Book 5,Chapter 2,"When the Roman generals conceived greater hopes from a blockade thanfrom an assault, winter huts also, a thing quite new to the Romansoldier, began to be built; and their determination was to continue thewar by wintering there. After an account of this was brought to Rome tothe tribunes of the people, who for a long time past had found nopretext for exciting disturbances, they run forward into the assembly,stir up the minds of the commons, saying that ""this was the motive forwhich pay had been established for the soldiers, nor had it escapedtheir knowledge, that such a present from the enemies was tainted withpoison. That the liberty of the commons had been sold; that their youthremoved for ever, and exiled from the city and the republic, did not noweven yield to the winter and to the season of the year, and visit theirhomes and private affairs. What could they suppose was the cause forcontinuing the service without intermission? That undoubtedly theyshould find none other than [the fear] lest any thing might be done infurtherance of their interests by the attendance of those youths inwhom the entire strength of the commons lay. Besides that they wereharassed and worked much more severely than the Veientians. For thelatter spent the winter beneath their own roofs, defending their city bystrong walls and its natural situation, whilst the Roman soldier, in themidst of toil and hardship, continued beneath the covering of skins,overwhelmed with snow and frost, not laying aside his arms even duringthe period of winter, which is a respite from all wars by land and sea.Neither kings, nor those consuls, tyrannical as they were before theinstitution of the tribunitian office, nor the stern authority of thedictator, nor the overbearing decemvirs, ever imposed such slavery asthat they should perform unremitting military service, which degree ofregal power the military tribunes now exercised over the Roman commons.What would these men have done as consuls or dictators, who haveexhibited the picture of the proconsular office so implacable andmenacing? but that all this happened justly. Among eight militarytribunes there was no room even for one plebeian. Formerly thepatricians filled up three places with the utmost difficulty; now theywent in file eight deep to take possession of the various offices; andnot even in such a crowd is any plebeian intermixed; who, if he did noother good, might remind his colleagues, that it was freemen and fellowcitizens, and not slaves, that constituted the army, who ought to bebrought back during winter at least to their homes and roofs; and tocome and see at some part of the year their parents, children, andwives, and to exercise the rights of freedom, and to take part inelecting magistrates."" While they exclaimed in these and such terms,they found in Appius Claudius an opponent not unequal to them, who hadbeen left behind by his colleagues to check the turbulence of thetribunes; a man trained even from his youth in contests with theplebeians; who several year's before, as has been mentioned, recommendedthe dissolution of the tribunitian power by means of the protests oftheir colleagues."Book 5,Chapter 3,"He, not only endowed with good natural powers, but well trained alsoby experience, on that particular occasion, delivered the followingaddress: ""If, Romans, there was ever reason to doubt, whether thetribunes of the people have ever promoted sedition for your sake ortheir own, I am certain that in the course of this year that doubt musthave ceased to exist; and while I rejoice that an end has at length comeof a mistake of such long continuance, I in the next place congratulateyou, and on your account the republic, that this delusion has beenremoved during a course of prosperous events. Is there any person whocan feel a doubt that the tribunes of the commons were never so highlydispleased and provoked by any wrongs done to you, if ever such didhappen, as by the munificence of the patricians to the commons, when paywas established for those serving in the army. What else do you supposethat they either then dreaded, or now wish to disturb, except the unionbetween the orders, which they think contributes most to the dissolutionof the tribunitian power? Thus, by Jove, like workers in iniquity, theyare seeking for work, who also wish that there should be always somediseased part in the republic, that there may be something for the cureof which they may be employed by you. For, [tribunes,] whether do youdefend or attack the commons? whether are you the enemies of those inthe service, or do you plead their cause? Unless perhaps you say,whatever the patricians do, displeases us; whether it is for thecommons, or against the commons; and just as masters forbid their slavesto have any dealing with those belonging to others, and deem it rightthat they should equally refrain from having any commerce with them,either for kindness or unkindness; ye, in like manner, interdict us thepatricians from all intercourse with the people, lest by ourcourteousness and munificence we may challenge their regard, and theybecome tractable and obedient to our direction. And if there were in youany thing of the feeling, I say not of fellow-citizens, but of humanbeings, how much more ought you to favour, and, as far as in you lay, topromote rather the kindly demeanour of the patricians and thetractability of the commons! And if such concord were once permanent,who would not venture to engage, that this empire would in a short timebecome the highest among the neighbouring states?"Book 5,Chapter 4,"""I shall hereafter explain to you how not only expedient, but evennecessary has been this plan of my colleagues, according to which theywould not draw off the army from Veii until the business has beencompleted. For the present I am disposed to speak concerning thecondition of the soldiers. Which observations of mine I think wouldappear reasonable not only before you, but even, if they were deliveredin the camp, in the opinion of the soldiers themselves; on which subjectif nothing could suggest itself to my own mind to say, I certainlyshould be satisfied with that which is suggested by the arguments of myadversaries. They lately said, that pay should not be given to thesoldiers because it had never been given. How then can they now feeldispleased, that additional labour should be imposed in due proportionon those to whom some addition of profit has been added? In no case isthere either labour without emolument, nor emolument in general withoutthe expense of labour. Toil and pleasure, in their natures most unlike,are yet linked together by a sort of natural connexion. Formerly thesoldier thought it a hardship that he gave his labour to thecommonwealth at his own expense; at the same time he was glad for a partof the year to till his own ground; to acquire that means whence hemight support himself and family at home and in war. Now he feels apleasure that the republic is a source of advantage to him, and gladlyreceives his pay. Let him therefore bear with patience that he is alittle longer absent from home and his family affairs, to which no heavyexpense is now attached. Whether if the commonwealth should call him toa settlement of accounts, would it not justly say, You have pay by theyear, perform labour by the year? do you think it just to receive awhole year's pay for six months' service? Romans, with reluctance do Idwell on this topic; for so ought those persons proceed who employmercenary troops. But we wish to treat as with fellow-citizens, and wethink it only just that you treat with us as with the country. Eitherthe war should not have been undertaken, or it ought to be conductedsuitably to the dignity of the Roman people, and brought to a close assoon as possible. But it will be brought to a conclusion if we press onthe besieged; if we do not retire until we have consummated our hopes bythe capture of Veii. In truth, if there were no other motive, the verydiscredit of the thing should impose on us perseverance. In former timesa city was kept besieged for ten years, on account of one woman, by allGreece. At what a distance from their homes! how many lands, how manyseas distant! We grumble at enduring a siege of a year's duration withintwenty miles of us, almost within sight of our own city; because, Isuppose, the cause of the war is trifling, nor is there resentmentsufficiently just to stimulate us to persevere. Seven times they haverebelled: in peace they never acted faithfully. They have laid waste ourlands a thousand times: the Fidenatians they forced to revolt from us:they have put to death our colonists there: contrary to the law ofnations, they have been the instigators of the impious murder of ourambassadors: they wished to excite all Etruria against us, and are atthis day busily employed at it; and they scarcely refrained fromviolating our ambassadors when demanding restitution. With such peopleought war to be conducted in a remiss and dilatory manner?"Book 5,Chapter 5,"""If such just resentment have no influence with us, will not, Ientreat you, the following considerations influence you? Their city hasbeen enclosed with immense works, by which the enemy is confined withintheir walls. They have not tilled their land, and what was previouslytilled has been laid waste in the war. If we withdraw our army, who isthere who can doubt that they will invade our territory not only from adesire of revenge, but from the necessity also imposed on them ofplundering from the property of others, since they have lost their own?By such measures then we do not put off the war, but admit it within ourown frontiers. What shall I say of that which properly interests thesoldiers, for whose interests those worthy tribunes of the commons, allon a sudden, are now so anxious to provide, after they have endeavouredto wrest their pay from them? How does it stand? They have formed arampart and a trench, both works of great labour, through so great anextent of ground; they have erected forts, at first only a few,afterwards very many, when the army became increased; they have raiseddefenders not only towards the city, but towards Etruria also, againstany succours which may come from thence. What need I mention towers,vine¾, and testudines, and the other apparatus used in attacking towns?When so much labour has been expended, and they have now at lengthreached the end of the work, do you think that all these preparationsshould be abandoned that, next summer, the same course of toil may haveto be undergone again in forming them anew? How much less trouble tosupport the works already done, and to press on and persevere, and toget rid of our task! For certainly the matter is of short duration, ifit be conducted with a uniform course of exertions; nor do we by theseintermissions and interruptions expedite the attainment of our hopes. Iam now speaking of labour and of loss of time. What? do these suchfrequent meetings in Etruria on the subject of sending aid to Veiisuffer us to disregard the danger which we encounter by procrastinatingthe war? As matters stand now, they are incensed, they dislike them,they refuse to send any; as far as they are concerned, we are at libertyto take Veii. Who can promise that their temper will be the samehereafter, if the war is suspended? when, if you suffer any relaxation,more respectable and more frequent embassies will go; when that whichnow displeases the Etrurians, the establishment of a king at Veii, may,after an interval, be done away with, either by the joint determinationof the state that they may recover the good will of the Etrurians, or bya voluntary act of the king, who may be unwilling that his reign shouldstand in the way of the welfare of his countrymen. See how manycircumstances, and how detrimental, follow that line of conduct: theloss of works formed with so great labour; the threatening devastationof our frontiers; an Etruscan excited instead of a Veientian war. These,tribunes, are your measures, pretty much the same, in truth, as if aperson should render a disease tedious, and perhaps incurable, for thesake of present meat or drink, in a patient who, by resolutely sufferinghimself to be treated, might soon recover his health."Book 5,Chapter 6,"""If, by Jove, it were of no consequence with respect to the presentwar, yet it certainly would be of the utmost importance to militarydiscipline, that our soldiers should be accustomed not only to enjoy thevictory obtained by them; but even though matters should proceed moreslowly than was anticipated, to brook the tediousness and await theissue of their hopes, however tardy; and if the war be not finished inthe summer, to wait for the winter, and not, like summer birds, in thevery commencement of autumn look out for shelter and a retreat. I prayyou, the eagerness and pleasure of hunting hurries men into snow andfrost, over mountains and woods; shall we not employ that patience onthe exigencies of war, which even sport and pleasure are wont to callforth? Are we to suppose that the bodies of our soldiers are soeffeminate, their minds so feeble, that they cannot hold out for onewinter in a camp, and be absent from home? that, like persons who wage anaval war, by taking advantage of the weather, and observing the seasonof the year, they are able to endure neither heat nor cold? They wouldcertainly blush, should any one lay these things to their charge; andwould maintain that both their minds and their bodies were possessed ofmanly endurance, and that they were able to conduct war equally well inwinter and in summer; and that they had not consigned to the tribunesthe patronage of indolence and sloth, and that they remembered thattheir ancestors had created this very power, neither in the shade norbeneath their roofs. Such sentiments are worthy of the valour of yoursoldiers, such sentiments are worthy of the Roman name, not to considermerely Veii, nor this war which is now pressing us, but to seek areputation for hereafter for other wars and for other states. Do youconsider the difference of opinion likely to result from this matter astrivial? Whether, pray, are the neighbouring states to suppose that theRoman people is such, that if any one shall sustain their first assault,and that of very short continuance, they have nothing afterwards tofear? or whether such should be the terror of our name, that neither thetediousness of a distant siege, nor the inclemency of winter, candislodge the Roman army from a city once invested, and that they know noother termination of war than victory, and that they carry on wars notmore by briskness than by perseverance; which is necessary no doubt inevery kind of war, but more especially in besieging cities; most ofwhich, impregnable both by their works and by natural situation, timeitself overpowers and reduces by famine and thirst; as it will reduceVeii, unless the tribunes of the commons shall afford aid to the enemy,and the Veientians find in Rome reinforcements which they seek in vainin Etruria. Is there any thing which can happen so much in accordancewith the wishes of the Veientians, as that first the Roman city, thenthe camp, as it were by contagion, should be filled with sedition? But,by Jove, among the enemy so forbearing a state of mind prevails, thatnot a single change has taken place among them, either through disgustat the length of the siege nor even of the kingly form of government;nor has the refusal of aid by the Etrurians aroused their tempers. Forwhoever will be the abettor of sedition, will be instantly put to death;nor will it be permitted to any one to utter those sentiments whichamongst you are expressed with impunity. He is sure to receive thebastinade, who forsakes his colours or quits his post. Persons advisingnot one or two soldiers, but whole armies to relinquish their colours orto forsake their camp, are openly listened to in your public assemblies.Accordingly whatever a tribune of the people says, although it tends tothe ruin of the country or the dissolution of the commonwealth, you areaccustomed to listen to with partiality; and captivated with the charmsof that authority, you suffer all sorts of crimes to lie concealedbeneath it. The only thing that remains is, that what they vociferatehere, the same projects do they realize in the camp and among thesoldiers, and seduce the armies, and not suffer them to obey theirofficers; since that and that only is liberty in Rome, to show nodeference to the senate, nor to magistrates, nor laws, nor the usages ofancestors, nor the institutions of our fathers, nor militarydiscipline."""Book 5,Chapter 7,"Even already Appius was a match for the tribunes of the people in thepopular assemblies; when suddenly a misfortune sustained before Veii,from a quarter whence no one could expect it, both gave Appius thesuperiority in the dispute, produced also a greater harmony between thedifferent orders, and greater ardour to carry on the siege of Veii withmore pertinacity. For when the trenches were now advanced to the verycity, and the machines were almost about to be applied to the walls,whilst the works are carried on with greater assiduity by day, than theyare guarded by night, a gate was thrown open on a sudden, and a vastmultitude, armed chiefly with torches, cast fire about on all sides; andafter the lapse of an hour the flames destroyed both the rampart and themachines, the work of so long a time, and great numbers of men, bearingassistance in vain, were destroyed by the sword and by fire. When theaccount of this circumstance was brought to Rome, it inspired sadnessinto all ranks; into the senate anxiety and apprehension, lest thesedition could no longer be withstood either in the city or in the camp,and lest the tribunes of the commons should insult over thecommonwealth, as if vanquished by them; when on a sudden, those whopossessed an equestrian fortune, but to whom horses had not beenassigned by the public, having previously held a meeting together, wentto the senate; and having obtained permission to speak, promise thatthey will serve on their own horses. And when thanks were returned tothem by the senate in the most complimentary terms, and the report ofthis proceeding spread through the forum and the city, there suddenlyensues a concourse of the commons to the senate-house. They say that""they are now of the pedestrian order, and they preferred their servicesto the commonwealth, though not compelled to serve, whether they wishedto march them to Veii, or to any other place. If they were led to Veii,they affirm, that they would not return from thence, until the city ofthe enemy was taken."" Then indeed they with difficulty set bounds to thejoy which now poured in upon them; for they were not ordered, as in thecase of the horsemen, to be publicly eulogized, the order for so doingbeing consigned to the magistrates, nor were they summoned into thesenate-house to receive an answer; nor did the senate confine themselveswithin the threshold of their house, but every one of them individuallywith their voice and hands testified from the elevated ground the publicjoy to the multitude standing in the assembly; they declared that bythat unanimity the Roman city would be happy, and invincible andeternal; praised the horsemen, praised the commons; extolled the dayitself by their praises; they acknowledged that the courtesy andkindness of the senate was outdone. Tears flowed in abundance throughjoy both from the patricians and commons; until the senators beingcalled back into the house, a decree of the senate was passed, ""that themilitary tribunes, summoning an assembly, should return thanks to theinfantry and cavalry; and should state that the senate would be mindfulof their affectionate attachment to their country. But that it was theirwish that their pay should go on for those who had, out of their turn,undertaken voluntary service."" To the horsemen also a certain stipendwas assigned. Then for the first time the cavalry began to serve ontheir own horses. This army of volunteers being led to Veii, not onlyrestored the works which had been lost, but also erected new ones.Supplies were conveyed from the city with greater care than before; lestany thing should be wanting for the accommodation of an army whodeserved so well."Book 5,Chapter 8,"The following year had military tribunes with consular authority,Caius Servilius Ahala a third time, Quintus Servilius, Lucius Virginius,Quintus Sulpicius, Aulus Manlius a second time, Manius Sergius a secondtime. During their tribuneship, whilst the solicitude of all wasdirected to the Veientian war, the garrison at Anxur was neglected inconsequence of the absence of the soldiers on leave, and from theindiscriminate admission of Volscian traders was overpowered, the guardsat the gates being suddenly betrayed. Less of the soldiers perished,because they were all trafficking through the country and city likesuttlers. Nor were matters conducted more successfully at Veii, whichwas then the chief object of all public solicitude. For both the Romancommanders had more quarrels among themselves, than spirit against theenemy; and the severity of the war was exaggerated by the sudden arrivalof the Capenatians and the Faliscians. These two states of Etruria,because they were contiguous in situation, judging that in case Veii wasconquered, they should be next to the attacks of the Romans in war; theFaliscians also, incensed from a cause affecting themselves, becausethey had already on a former occasion mixed themselves up in aFidenatian war, being bound together by an oath by reciprocal embassies,marched unexpectedly with their armies to Veii. It so happened, theyattacked the camp in that quarter where Manius Sergius, militarytribune, commanded, and occasioned great alarm; because the Romansimagined that all Etruria was aroused and were advancing in a greatmass. The same opinion aroused the Veientians in the city. Thus theRoman camp was attacked on both sides; and crowding together, whilstthey wheeled round their battalions from one post to another, they wereunable either to confine the Veientians within their fortifications, orrepel the assault from their own works, and to defend themselves fromthe enemy on the outside. The only hope was, if succour could be broughtfrom the greater camp, that the different legions should fight, someagainst the Capenatians and Faliscians, others against the sallies ofthe townsmen. But Virginius had the command of that camp, who, frompersonal grounds, was hateful to and incensed against Sergius. Thisman, when word was brought that most of the forts were attacked, thefortifications scaled, and that the enemy were pouring in on both sides,kept his men under arms, saying that if there was need of assistance,his colleague would send to him. His arrogance was equalled by theobstinacy of the other; who, that he might not appear to have sought anyaid from an adversary, preferred being defeated by an enemy toconquering through a fellow-citizen. His men were for a long time cutdown between both: at length, abandoning their works, a very smallnumber made their way to the principal camp; the greater number, withSergius himself, made their way to Rome. Where, when he threw the entireblame on his colleague, it was resolved that Virginius should be sentfor from the camp, and that lieutenant-generals should take the commandin the mean time. The affair was then discussed in the senate, and thedispute was carried on between the colleagues with (mutual)recriminations. But few took up the interests of the republic, (thegreater number) favoured the one or the other, according as privateregard or interest prejudiced each."Book 5,Chapter 9,"The principal senators were of opinion, that whether so ignominious adefeat had been sustained through the misconduct or the misfortune ofthe commanders, ""the regular time of the elections should not be waitedfor, but that new military tribunes should be created immediately, whoshould enter into office on the calends of October."" Whilst they wereproceeding to intimate their assent to this opinion, the other militarytribunes offered no opposition. But Sergius and Virginius, on whoseaccount it was evident that the senate were dissatisfied with themagistrates of that year, at first deprecated the ignominy, thenprotested against the decree of the senate; they declared that theywould not retire from office before the ides of December, the usual dayfor persons entering on magisterial duties. Upon this the tribunes ofthe plebeians, whilst in the general harmony and in the prosperous stateof public affairs they had unwillingly kept silence, suddenly becomingconfident, began to threaten the military tribunes, that unless theyconformed to the order of the senate, they would order them to be throwninto prison. Then Caius Servilius Ahala, a military tribune, observed,""With respect to you, tribunes of the commons, and your threats, Iwould with pleasure put it to the test, how there is not more ofauthority in the latter than of spirit in yourselves. But it is impiousto strive against the authority of the senate. Wherefore do you cease toseek amid our quarrels for an opportunity of doing mischief; and mycolleagues will either do that which the senate thinks fit, or if theyshall persist with too much pertinacity, I will immediately nominate adictator, who will oblige them to retire from office."" When this speechwas approved with general consent, and the patricians rejoiced, thatwithout the terrors of the tribunitian office, another and a superiorpower had been discovered to coerce the magistrates, overcome by theuniversal consent, they held the elections of military tribunes, whowere to commence their office on the calends of October, and before thatday they retired from office."Book 5,Chapter 10,"During the military tribuneship of Lucius Valerius Potitus for thefourth time, Marcus Furius Camillus for the second time, Manius ®miliusMamercinus a third time, Cneius Cornelius Cossus a second time, K¾soFabius Ambustus, Lucius Julius Iulus, much business was transacted athome and abroad. For there was both a complex war at the same time, atVeii, at Capena, at Falerii, and among the Volscians, that Anxur mightbe recovered from the enemy; and at the same time there was somedifficulty experienced both in consequence of the levy, and of thecontribution of the tax: there was also a contention about theappointment of plebeian tribunes; and the two trials of those, who alittle before had been invested with consular authority, excited notrifling commotion. First of all the tribunes of the soldiers took carethat the levy should be held; and not only the juniors were enlisted,but the seniors also were compelled to give in their names, to serve asa garrison to the city. But in proportion as the number of the soldierswas augmented, so much the greater sum of money was required for pay;and this was collected by a tax, those who remained at home contributingagainst their will, because those who guarded the city had to performmilitary service also, and to serve the commonwealth. The tribunes ofthe commons, by their seditious harangues, caused these things, grievousin themselves, to seem more exasperating, by their asserting, ""that paywas established for the soldiers with this view, that they might wearout one half of the commons by military service, the other half by thetax. That a single war was being waged now for the third year, onpurpose that they may have a longer time to wage it. That armies hadbeen raised at one levy for four different wars, and that boys even andold men were dragged from home. That neither summer nor winter now madeany difference, so that there may never be any respite for theunfortunate commons, who were now even at last made to pay a tax; sothat after they brought home their bodies wasted by hardship, wounds,and eventually by age, and found their properties at home neglected bythe absence of the proprietors, had to pay a tax out of their impairedfortunes, and to refund to the state in a manifold proportion themilitary pay which had been as it were received on interest."" Betweenthe levy and the tax, and their minds being taken up by more importantconcerns, the number of plebeian tribunes could not be filled up at theelections. A struggle was afterwards made that patricians should beelected into the vacant places. When this could not be carried, still,for the purpose of weakening the Trebonian law, it was managed thatCaius Lacerius and Marcus Acutius should be admitted as tribunes of thecommons, no doubt through the influence of the patricians."Book 5,Chapter 11,"Chance so directed it, that this year Cneius Trebonius was tribuneof the commons, and he considered that he undertook the patronage of theTrebonian law as a debt due to his name and family. He crying out aloud,""that a point which some patricians had aimed at, though baffled intheir first attempt, had yet been carried by the military tribunes; thatthe Trebonian law had been subverted, and tribunes of the commons hadbeen elected not by the suffrages of the people but by the mandate ofthe patricians; and that the thing was now come to this, that eitherpatricians or dependants of patricians were to be had for tribunes ofthe commons; that the devoting laws were taken away, the tribunitianpower wrested from them; he alleged that this was effected by someartifice of the patricians, by the villany and treachery of hiscolleagues."" While not only the patricians, but the tribunes of thecommons also became objects of public resentment; as well those who wereelected, as those who had elected them; then three of the college,Publius Curiatius, Marcus Metilius, and Marcus Minucius, alarmed fortheir interests, make an attack on Sergius and Virginius, militarytribunes of the former year; they turn away the resentment of thecommons, and public odium from themselves on them, by appointing a dayof trial for them. They observe that ""those persons by whom the levy,the tribute, the long service, and the distant seat of the war was feltas a grievance, those who lamented the calamity sustained at Veii; suchas had their houses in mourning through the loss of children, brothers,relatives, and kinsmen, had now through their means the right and powerof avenging the public and private sorrow on the two guilty causes. Forthat the sources of all their sufferings were centred in Sergius andVirginius: nor did the prosecutor advance that charge moresatisfactorily than the accused acknowledged it; who, both guilty, threwthe blame from one to the other, Virginius charging Sergius with runningaway, Sergius charging Virginius with treachery. The folly of whoseconduct was so incredible, that it is much more probable that the affairhad been contrived by concert, and by the common artifice of thepatricians. That by them also an opportunity was formerly given to theVeientians to burn the works for the sake of protracting the war; andthat now the army was betrayed, and the Roman camp delivered up to theFaliscians. That every thing was done that the young men should grow oldbefore Veii, and that the tribunes should not be able to consult thepeople either regarding the lands or the other interests of the commons,and to give weight to their measures by a numerous attendance [ofcitizens], and to make head against the conspiracy of the patricians.That a previous judgment had been already passed on the accused both bythe senate and the Roman people and by their own colleagues. For that bya decree of the senate they had been removed from the administration ofaffairs, and when they refused to resign their office they had beenforced into it by their colleagues; and that the Roman people hadelected tribunes, who were to enter on their office not on the ides ofDecember, the usual day, but instantly on the calends of October,because the republic could no longer subsist, these persons remaining inoffice. And yet these individuals, overwhelmed and already condemned byso many decisions against them, presented themselves for trial beforethe people; and thought that they were done with the matter, and hadsuffered sufficient punishment, because they were reduced to the stateof private citizens two months sooner [than ordinary]: and did notconsider that the power of doing mischief any longer was then taken fromthem, that punishment was not inflicted; for that the official power oftheir colleagues also had been taken from them who certainly hadcommitted no fault. That the Roman citizens should resume thosesentiments which they had when the recent disaster was sustained, whenthey beheld the army flying in consternation, covered with wounds, andin dismay pouring into the gates, accusing not fortune nor any of thegods, but these their commanders. They were certain, that there was nota man present in the assembly who did not execrate and detest thepersons, families, and fortunes of Lucius Virginius and Manius Sergius.That it was by no means consistent that now, when it was lawful andtheir duty, they should not exert their power against persons, on whomthey had severally imprecated the vengeance of the gods. That the godsthemselves never laid hands on the guilty; it was enough if they armedthe injured with the means of taking revenge."""Book 5,Chapter 12,"Urged on by these discourses the commons condemn the accused [in afine] of ten thousand _asses_ in weight, Sergius in vain throwing theblame on fortune and the common chance of war, Virginius entreating thathe might not be more unfortunate at home than he had been in the field.The resentment of the people being turned against them, obliterated theremembrance of the assumption of the tribunes and of the fraud committedagainst the Trebonian law. The victorious tribunes, in order that thepeople might reap an immediate benefit from the trial, publish a form ofan agrarian law, and prevent the tax from being contributed, since therewas need of pay for so great a number of troops, and the enterprises ofthe service were conducted with success in such a manner, that in noneof the wars did they reach the consummation of their hope. At Veii thecamp which had been lost was recovered and strengthened with forts and agarrison. Here M. ®milius and K¾so Fabius, military tribunes, commanded.None of the enemy were found outside the walls by Marcus Furius in theFalisean territory, and Cneius Cornelius in the Capenatian district:spoil was driven off, and the country laid waste by burning of thehouses and the fruits of the earth: the towns were neither assaultednor besieged. But among the Volscians, their territory beingdepopulated, Anxur, which was situate on an eminence, was assaulted, butto no purpose; and when force was ineffectual, they commenced tosurround it with a rampart and a trench. The province of the Volscianshad fallen [to the lot of] Valerius Potitus. In this state of militaryaffairs an intestine disturbance broke out with greater violence thanthe wars were proceeded with. And when it was rendered impossible by thetribunes to have the tax paid, and the payment [of the army] was notremitted to the generals, and the soldiers became importunate for theirpay, the camp also was well nigh being involved in the contagion of thesedition in the city. Amid this resentment of the commons against thepatricians, though the tribunes asserted that now was the time forestablishing liberty, and transferring the sovereign dignity from theSergii and Virginii to plebeians, men of fortitude and energy, stillthey proceeded no further than the election of one of the commons,Publius Licinius Calvus, military tribune with consular power for thepurpose of establishing their right by precedent: the others electedwere patricians, Publius M¾nius, Lucius Titinius, Publius M¾lius, LuciusFurius Medullinus, Lucius Publius Volscus. The commons themselves weresurprised at having gained so important a point, and not merely he whohad been elected, being a person who had filled no post of honourbefore, being only a senator of long standing, and now weighed down withyears. Nor does it sufficiently appear, why he was elected first and inpreference to any one else to taste the sweets of the new dignity. Somethink that he was raised to so high a dignity through the influence ofhis brother, Cneius Cornelius, who had been military tribune on thepreceding year, and had given triple pay to the cavalry. Others [say]that he had himself delivered a seasonable address equally acceptable tothe patricians and commons, concerning the harmony of the several orders[of the state]. The tribunes of the commons, exulting in this victory atthe election, relaxed in their opposition regarding the tax, a matterwhich very much impeded the progress of public business. It was paid inwith submission, and sent to the army."Book 5,Chapter 13,"In the country of the Volscians Anxur was soon retaken, the guardingof the city having been neglected during a festival day. This year wasremarkable for a cold and snowy winter, so that the roads wereimpassable, and the Tiber not navigable. The price of provisionsunderwent no change, in consequence of the abundance previously laid in.And because Publius Licinius, as he obtained his office without anyrioting, to the greater joy of the commons than annoyance of thepatricians, so also did he administer it; a rapturous desire of electingplebeians at the next election took possession of them. Of thepatricians Marcus Veturius alone obtained a place: almost all thecenturies appointed the other plebeian candidates as military tribuneswith consular authority. Marcus Pomponius, Caius Duilius, VoleroPublilius, Cneius Genucius, Lucius Atilius. The severe winter, whetherfrom the ill temperature of the air [arising] from the abrupt transitionto the contrary state, or from whatsoever other cause, was followed byan unhealthy summer, destructive to all species of animals; and whenneither the cause nor termination of this intractable pestilence couldbe discovered, the Sibylline books were consulted according to a decreeof the senate. The duumvirs for the direction of religious matters, thelectisternium being then for the first time introduced into the city ofRome, for eight days implored the favour of Apollo and Latona, Diana andHercules, Mercury and Neptune, three couches being laid out with thegreatest magnificence that was then possible. The same solemn rite wasobserved also by private individuals. The doors lying open throughoutthe entire city, and the use of every thing lying out in common, theysay that all passengers, both those known and those unknownindiscriminately, were invited to lodgings, and that conversation wasadopted between persons at variance with complaisance and kindness, andthat they refrained from disputes and quarrels; their chains were alsotaken off those who were in confinement during those days; thatafterward a scruple was felt in imprisoning those to whom the gods hadbrought such aid. In the mean while the alarm was multiplied at Veii,three wars being concentred in the one place. For as the Capenatians andFaliscians had suddenly come with succour [to the Veientians], they hadto fight against three armies on different sides in the same manner asformerly, through the whole extent of their works. The recollection ofthe sentence passed on Sergius and Virginius aided them above everything else. Accordingly some forces being led around in a short timefrom the principal camp, where some delay had been made on the formeroccasion, attack the Capenatians on their rear, whilst they were engagedin front against the Roman rampart. The fight commencing in this quarterstruck terror into the Faliscians also, and a sally from the campopportunely made put them to flight, thrown into disorder as they nowwere. The victors, having then pursued them in their retreat, made greatslaughter amongst them. And soon after those who had been devastatingthe territory of Capena, having met them as it were by chance, entirelycut off the survivors of the fight as they were straggling through thecountry: and many of the Veientians in their retreat to the city wereslain before the gates; whilst, through fear lest the Romans shouldforce in along with them, they excluded the hindmost of their men byclosing the gates."Book 5,Chapter 14,"These were the transactions of that year. And now the election ofmilitary tribunes approached; about which the patricians felt moreintense solicitude than about the war, inasmuch as they saw that thesupreme authority was not only shared with the commons, but almost lostto themselves. Wherefore the most distinguished individuals being, byconcert, prepared to stand candidates, whom they thought [the people]would feel ashamed to pass by, they themselves, nevertheless, as if theywere all candidates, trying every expedient, strove to gain over notonly men, but the gods also, raising religious scruples about theelections held the two preceding years; that, in the former of thoseyears, a winter set in intolerably severe, and like to a prodigy fromthe gods; on the next year [they had] not prodigies, but events, apestilence inflicted on both city and country through the manifestresentment of the gods: whom, as was discovered in the books of thefates, it was necessary to appease, for the purpose of warding off thatplague. That it seemed to the gods an affront that honours should beprostituted, and the distinctions of birth confounded, in an electionwhich was held under proper auspices. The people, overawed as well bythe dignity of the candidates as by a sense of religion, elected all themilitary tribunes with consular power from among the patricians, thegreater part being men who had been most highly distinguished by honour;Lucius Valerius Potitus a fifth time, Marcus Valerius Maximus, MarcusFurius Camillus a third time, Lucius Furius Medullinus a third time,Quintus Servilius Fidenas a second time, Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus asecond time. During this tribunate, nothing very memorable was performedat Veii. All their force was employed in depopulating the country. Twoconsummate commanders, Potitus from Falerii, Camillus from Capena,carried off great booty, nothing being left undestroyed which could beinjured by sword or by fire."Book 5,Chapter 15,"In the mean time many prodigies were announced; the greater part ofwhich were little credited or even slighted, because individuals werethe reporters of them, and also because, the Etrurians being now at warwith them, they had no aruspices through whom they might attend to them.The attention of all was turned to a particular one: the lake in theAlban grove swelled to an unusual height without any rain, or any othercause which could account for the matter independently of a miracle.Commissioners were sent to the Delphic oracle to inquire what the godsportended by this prodigy; but an interpreter of the fates was presentedto them nearer home in a certain aged Veientian, who, amid the scoffsthrown out by the Roman and Etrurian soldiers from the out-posts andguards, declared, after the manner of one delivering a prophecy, thatuntil the water should be discharged from the Alban lake, the Romansshould never become masters of Veii. This was disregarded at first ashaving been thrown out at random, afterwards it began to be canvassed inconversation; until one of the Roman soldiers on guard asked one of thetownsmen who was nearest him (a conversational intercourse having nowtaken place in consequence of the long continuance of the war) who hewas, who threw out those dark expressions concerning the Alban lake?After he heard that he was an aruspex, being a man whose mind was notwithout a tincture of religion, pretending that he wished to consult himon the expiation of a private portent, if he could aid him, he enticedthe prophet to a conference. And when, being unarmed, they had proceededa considerable distance from their respective parties without anyapprehension, the Roman youth having the advantage in strength, took upthe feeble old man in the sight of all, and amid the ineffectual bustlemade by the Etrurians, carried him away to his own party. When he wasconducted before the general, and sent from thence to Rome to thesenate, to those who asked him what that was which he had statedconcerning the Alban lake, he replied, ""that undoubtedly the gods wereangry with the Veientian people on that day, on which they had inspiredhim with the resolve to disclose the ruin of his country as destined bythe fates. Wherefore what he then declared urged by divine inspiration,he neither could recall so that it may be unsaid; and perhaps byconcealing what the immortal gods wished to be published, no less guiltwas contracted than by openly declaring what ought to be concealed. Thustherefore it was recorded in the books of the fates, thus in theEtrurian doctrine, that whensoever the Alban water should rise to agreat height, then, if the Romans should discharge it in a propermanner, victory was granted them over the Veientians: before thatoccurred, that the gods would not desert the walls of Veii."" He thendetailed what would be the legitimate method of draining. But the senatedeeming his authority as but of little weight, and not to be entirelydepended on in so important a matter, determined to wait for thedeputies and the responses of the Pythian oracle."Book 5,Chapter 16,"Before the commissioners returned from Delphos, or an expiation ofthe Alban prodigy was discovered, the new military tribunes withconsular power entered on their office, Lucius Julius Iulus, LuciusFurius Medullinus for the fourth time, Lucius Sergius Fidenas, AulusPostumius Regillensis, Publius Cornelius Maluginensis, and AulusManlius. This year a new enemy, the Tarquinians, started up. Becausethey saw the Romans engaged in many wars together, that of the Volsciansat Anxur, where the garrison was besieged, that of the ®quans at Lavici,who were attacking the Roman colony there, moreover in the Veientian,Faliscan, and Capenatian war, and that matters were not more tranquilwithin the walls, by reason of the dissensions between the patriciansand commons; considering that amid these [troubles] there was anopportunity for an attack, they send their light-armed cohorts to commitdepredations on the Roman territory. For [they concluded] either thatthe Romans would suffer that injury to pass off unavenged, that theymight not encumber themselves with an additional war, or that they wouldresent it with a scanty army, and one by no means strong. The Romans[felt] greater indignation, than alarm, at the inroads of theTarquinians. On this account the matter was neither taken up with greatpreparation, nor was it delayed for any length of time. Aulus Postumiusand Lucius Julius, having raised a body of men, not by a regular levy,(for they were prevented by the tribunes of the commons,) but [a bodyconsisting] mostly of volunteers, whom they had aroused by exhortations,having proceeded by cross marches through the territory of C¾re, fellunexpectedly on the Tarquinians, as they were returning from theirdepredations and laden with booty; they slew great numbers, strippedthem all of their baggage, and, having recovered the spoils of their ownlands, they return to Rome. Two days were allowed to the owners toreclaim their effects. On the third day, that portion not owned (formost of it belonged to the enemies themselves) was sold by publicauction; and what was produced from thence, was distributed among thesoldiers. The other wars, and more especially the Veientian, were ofdoubtful issue. And now the Romans, despairing of human aid, began tolook to the fates and the gods, when the deputies returned from Delphos,bringing with them an answer of the oracle, corresponding with theresponse of the captive prophet: ""Roman, beware lest the Alban water beconfined in the lake, beware of suffering it to flow into the sea in itsown stream. Thou shalt let it out and form a passage for it through thefields, and by dispersing it in channels thou shalt consume it. Thenpress boldly on the walls of the enemy, mindful that the victory isgranted to you by these fates which are now revealed over that citywhich thou art besieging for so many years. The war being ended, dothou, as victorious, bring ample offerings to my temples, and havingrenewed the religious institutions of your country, the care of whichhas been given up, perform them in the usual manner."""Book 5,Chapter 17,"Upon this the captive prophet began to be held in high esteem, andCornelius and Postumius, the military tribunes, began to employ him forthe expiation of the Alban prodigy, and to appease the gods in due form.And it was at length discovered wherein the gods found fault with theneglect of the ceremonies and the omission of the customary rites; thatit was undoubtedly nothing else, than that the magistrates, having beenappointed under some defect [in their election], had not directed theLatin festival and the solemnities on the Alban mount with dueregularity. The only mode of expiation in the case was, that themilitary tribunes should resign their office, the auspices be takenanew, and an interregnum be adopted. All these things were performedaccording to a decree of the senate. There were three interreges insuccession, Lucius Valerius, Quintus Servilius Fidenas, Marcus FuriusCamillus. In the mean time disturbances never ceased to exist, thetribunes of the commons impeding the elections until it was previouslystipulated, that the greater number of the military tribunes should beelected out of the commons. Whilst these things are going on, assembliesof Etruria were held at the temple of Voltumna, and the Capenatians andFaliscians demanding that all the states of Etruria should by commonconsent and resolve aid in raising the siege of Veii, the answer givenwas: ""that on a former occasion they had refused that to the Veientians,because they had no right to demand aid from those from whom they hadnot solicited advice on so important a matter. That for the presenttheir own condition instead of themselves[160] denied it to them, moreespecially in that part of Etruria. That a strange nation, the Gauls,were become new neighbours, with whom they neither had a sufficientlysecure peace, nor a certainty of war: to the blood, however, and thename and the present dangers of their kinsmen this [mark of respect] waspaid, that if any of their youth were disposed to go to that war, theywould not prevent them."" Hence there was a report at Rome, that a greatnumber of enemies had arrived, and in consequence the intestinedissensions began to subside, as is usual, through alarm for the generalsafety."Book 5,Chapter 18,"Without opposition on the part of the patricians, the prerogativetribe elect Publius Licinius Calvus military tribune without his suingfor it, a man of tried moderation in his former tribunate, but now ofextreme old age; and it was observed that all were re-elected in regularsuccession out of the college of the same year, Lucius Titinius, PubliusM¾nius, Publius M¾lius, Cneius Genucius, Lucius Atilius: before thesewere proclaimed, the tribes being summoned in the ordinary course,Publius Licinius Calvus, by permission of the interrex, spoke asfollows: ""Romans, I perceive that from the recollection of ouradministration you are seeking an omen of concord, a thing mostimportant at the present time, for the ensuing year. If you re-elect thesame colleagues, improved also by experience, in me you no longer beholdthe same person, but the shadow and name of Publius Licinius now left.The powers of my body are decayed, my senses of sight and hearing aregrown dull, my memory falters, the vigour of my mind is blunted. Beholdhere a youth,"" says he, holding his son, ""the representation and imageof him whom ye formerly made a military tribune, the first from amongthe commons. This youth, formed under my own discipline, I present anddedicate to the commonwealth as a substitute for myself. And I beseechyou, Romans, that the honour readily offered by yourselves to me, youwould grant to his suit, and to my prayers added in his behalf."" Thefavour was granted to the request of the father, and his son, PubliusLicinius, was declared military tribune with consular power along withthose whom I have mentioned above. Titinius and Genucius, militarytribunes, proceeded against the Faliscians and Capenatians, and whilstthey conduct the war with more courage than conduct, they fall into anambush. Genucius, atoning for his temerity by an honourable death, fellamong the foremost in front of the standards. Titinius, having collectedhis men from the great confusion [into which they were thrown] on arising ground, restored their order of battle; nor did he, however,venture to engage the enemy on even ground. More of disgrace than ofloss was sustained; which was well nigh proving a great calamity; somuch alarm was excited not only at Rome, whither an exaggerated accountof it had reached, but in the camp also at Veii. There the soldiers werewith difficulty restrained from flight, as a report had spread throughthe camp that, the generals and army having been cut to pieces, thevictorious Capenatians and Faliscians and all the youth of Etruria werenot far off. At Rome they gave credit to accounts still more alarmingthan these, that the camp at Veii was now attacked, that a part of theenemy was now advancing to the city prepared for an attack: they crowdedto the walls, and supplications of the matrons, which the public panichad called forth from their houses, were offered up in the temples; andthe gods were petitioned by prayers, that they would repel destructionfrom the houses and temples of the city and from the walls of Rome, andthat they would avert that terror to Veii, if the sacred rites had beenduly renewed, if the prodigies had been expiated."Book 5,Chapter 19,"The games and the Latin festival had now been performed anew; nowthe water from the Alban lake had been discharged upon the fields, andthe fates were demanding [the ruin of] Veii. Accordingly a generaldestined for the destruction of that city and the preservation of hiscountry, Marcus Furius Camillus, being nominated dictator, appointedPublius Cornelius Scipio his master of the horse. The change of thegeneral suddenly produced a change in every thing. Their hopes seemeddifferent, the spirits of the people were different, the fortune also ofthe city seemed changed. First of all, he punished according to militarydiscipline those who had fled from Veii in that panic, and took measuresthat the enemy should not be the most formidable object to the soldier.Then a levy being proclaimed for a certain day, he himself in the meanwhile makes an excursion to Veii to strengthen the spirits of thesoldiers: thence he returns to Rome to enlist the new army, not a singleman declining the service. Youth from foreign states also, Latins andHernicians, came, promising their service for the war: after thedictator returned them thanks in the senate, all preparations being nowcompleted for the war, he vowed, according to a decree of the senate,that he would, on the capture of Veii, celebrate the great games, andthat he would repair and dedicate the temple of Mother Matuta, which hadbeen formerly consecrated by King Servius Tullius. Having set out fromthe city with his army amid the high expectation[161] rather than merehopes of persons, he first encountered the Faliscians and Capenatians inthe district of Nepote. Every thing there being managed with consummateprudence and skill, was attended, as is usual, with success. He not onlyrouted the enemy in battle, but he stripped them also of their camp, andobtained a great quantity of spoil, the principal part of which washanded over to the qu¾stor; not much was given to the soldiers. Fromthence the army was marched to Veii, and additional forts close to eachother were erected; and by a proclamation being issued, that no oneshould fight without orders, the soldiers were taken off from thoseskirmishes, which frequently took place at random between the wall andrampart, [so as to apply] to the work. Of all the works, far thegreatest and more laborious was a mine which they commenced to carryinto the enemies' citadel. And that the work might not be interrupted,and that the continued labour under ground might not exhaust the sameindividuals, he divided the number of pioneers into six companies; sixhours were allotted for the work in rotation; nor by night or day didthey give up, until they made a passage into the citadel."Book 5,Chapter 20,"When the dictator now saw that the victory was in his hands, that amost opulent city was on the point of being taken, and that there wouldbe more spoil than had been obtained in all previous wars takentogether, that he might not incur either the resentment of the soldiersfrom a parsimonious partition of the plunder, or displeasure among thepatricians from a prodigal lavishing of it, he sent a letter to thesenate, ""that by the kindness of the immortal gods, his own measures,and the perseverance of the soldiers, Veii would be soon in the power ofthe Roman people."" What did they think should be done with respect tothe spoil? Two opinions divided the senate; the one that of the elderPublius Licinius, who on being first asked by his son, as they say,proposed it as his opinion, that a proclamation should be openly sentforth to the people, that whoever wished to share in the plunder, shouldproceed to the camp before Veii; the other that of Appius Claudius,[162]who, censuring such profusion as unprecedented, extravagant, partial,and one that was unadvisable, if they should once judge it criminal,that money taken from the enemy should be [deposited] in the treasurywhen exhausted by wars, advised their pay to be paid to the soldiers outof that money, so that the commons might thereby have to pay less tax.For that ""the families of all would feel their share of such a bounty inequal proportion; that the hands of the idlers in the city, ever greedyfor plunder, would not then carry off the prizes due to brave warriors,as it generally so happens that according as each individual is wont toseek the principal part of the toil and danger, so is he the leastactive as a plunderer."" Licinius, on the other hand, argued that themoney in that case would ever prove the source of jealousy andanimosity, and that it would afford grounds for charges before thecommons, and thence for seditions and new laws. ""That it was moreadvisable therefore that the feelings of the commons should beconciliated by that bounty; that succour should be afforded them,exhausted and drained by a tax of so many years, and that they shouldfeel the fruits arising from a war, in which they had in a manner grownold. What each took from the enemy with his own hand and brought homewith him would be more gratifying and delightful, than if he were toreceive a much larger share at the will of another."" That the dictatorhimself wished to shun the odium and recriminations arising from thematter; for that reason he transferred it to the senate. The senate,too, ought to hand the matter thus referred to them over to the commons,and suffer every man to have what the fortune of war gave to him. Thisproposition appeared to be the safer, as it would make the senatepopular. A proclamation was therefore issued, that those who choseshould proceed to the camp to the dictator for the plunder of Veii."Book 5,Chapter 21,"The vast multitude who went filled the camp. Then the dictator,going forth after taking the auspices, having issued orders that thesoldiers should take arms, says, ""Under thy guidance, O Pythian Apollo,and inspired by thy divinity, I proceed to destroy the city of Veii, andI vow to thee the tenth part of the spoil.[163] Thee also, queen Juno,who inhabitest Veii, I beseech, that thou wilt accompany us, whenvictors, into our city, soon to be thine, where a temple worthy of thymajesty shall receive thee.""[164] Having offered up these prayers, therebeing more than a sufficient number of men, he assaults the city onevery quarter, in order that the perception of the danger threateningthem from the mine might be diminished. The Veientians, ignorant thatthey had already been doomed by their own prophets, already by foreignoracles, that the gods had been already invited to a share in theirplunder, that some, called out by vows from their city, were lookingtowards the temple of the enemy and new habitations, and that they werespending that the last day [of their existence], fearing nothing lessthan that, their walls being undermined, the citadel was now filled withenemies, briskly run to the walls in arms, wondering what could be thereason that, when no one had stirred from the Roman posts for so manydays, then, as if struck with sudden fury, they should run heedlessly tothe walls. A fabulous narrative is introduced here, that, when the kingof the Veientians was offering sacrifice, the voice of the aruspex,declaring that the victory was given to him who should cut up theentrails of that victim, having been heard in the mine, incited theRoman soldiers to burst open the mine, carry off the entrails, and bringthem to the dictator. But in matters of such remote antiquity, I shoulddeem it sufficient, if matters bearing a resemblance to truth beadmitted as true. Such stories as this, more suited to display on thestage, which delights in the marvellous, than to historic authenticity,it is not worth while either to affirm or refute. The mine, at this timefull of chosen men, suddenly discharged the armed troops in the templeof Juno which was in the citadel of Veii.[165] Some of them attack therear of the enemy on the walls; some tore open the bars of the gates;some set fire to the houses, while stones and tiles were thrown downfrom the roofs by the women and slaves. Clamour, consisting of thevarious voices of the assailants and the terrified, mixed with thecrying of women and children, fills every place. The soldiers being inan instant beaten off from the walls, and the gates being thrown open,some entering in bodies, others scaling the deserted walls, the citybecome filled with enemies, fighting takes place in every quarter. Then,much slaughter being now made, the ardour of the fight abates; and thedictator commands the heralds to proclaim that the unarmed should bespared. This put an end to bloodshed. Then laying down their arms, theycommenced to surrender; and, by permission of the dictator, the soldiersdisperse in quest of plunder. And when this was collected before hiseyes, greater in quantity and in the value of the effects than he hadhoped or expected, the dictator, raising his hands to heaven, is said tohave prayed, ""that, if his success and that of the Roman people seemedexcessive to any of the gods and men, it might be permitted to the Romanpeople to appease that jealousy with as little detriment as possible tohimself and the Roman people.""[166] It is recorded that, when turningabout during this prayer, he stumbled and fell; and to persons judgingof the matter by subsequent events, that seemed to refer as an omen toCamillus' own condemnation, and the disaster of the city of Rome beingakin, which happened a few years after. And that day was consumed inslaughtering the enemy and in the plunder of this most opulent city."Book 5,Chapter 22,"On the following day the dictator sold the inhabitants of freecondition by auction: that was the only money applied to public use, notwithout resentment on the part of the people: and for the spoil theybrought home with them, they felt no obligation either to theircommander, who, in his search for abettors of his own parsimony, hadreferred to the senate a matter within his own jurisdiction, or to thesenate, but to the Licinian family, of which the son had laid the matterbefore the senate, and the father had been the proposer of so popular aresolution. When all human wealth had been carried away from Veii, theythen began to remove the offerings to their gods and the godsthemselves, but more after the manner of worshippers than of plunderers.For youths selected from the entire army, to whom the charge ofconveying queen Juno to Rome was assigned, after having thoroughlywashed their bodies and arrayed themselves in white garments, enteredher temple with profound adoration, applying their hands at first withreligious awe, because, according to the Etrurian usage, no one but apriest of a certain family had been accustomed to touch that statue.Then when some one, moved either by divine inspiration, or in youthfuljocularity, said, ""Juno, art thou willing to go to Rome,"" the restjoined in shouting that the goddess had nodded assent. To the story anaddition was afterwards made, that her voice was heard, declaring that""she was willing."" Certain it is, we are informed that, having beenraised from her place by machines of trifling power, she was light andeasily removed, like as if she [willingly] followed; and that she wasconveyed safe to the Aventine, her eternal seat, whither the vows of thedictator had invited her; where the same Camillus who had vowed it,afterwards dedicated a temple to her. Such was the fall of Veii, thewealthiest city of the Etrurian nation, which even in its finaloverthrow demonstrated its greatness; for having been besieged for tensummers and winters without intermission, after it had inflictedconsiderably greater losses than it had sustained, eventually, fate nowat length urging [its destruction], it was carried after all by thecontrivances of art, not by force."Book 5,Chapter 23,"When news was brought to Rome that Veii was taken, although boththe prodigies had been expiated, and the answers of the prophets and thePythian responses were well known, and though they had selected as theircommander Marcus Furius, the greatest general of the day, which wasdoing as much to promote success as could be done by human prudence; yetbecause the war had been carried on there for so many years with varioussuccess, and many losses had been sustained, their joy was unbounded, asif for an event not expected; and before the senate could pass anydecree, all the temples were crowded with Roman matrons returning thanksto the gods. The senate decrees supplications for the space of fourdays, a number of days greater than [was prescribed] in any former war.The dictator's arrival also, all ranks pouring out to meet him, wasbetter attended than that of any general before, and his triumphconsiderably surpassed all the ordinary style of honouring such a day.The most conspicuous of all was himself, riding through the city in achariot drawn by white horses; and that appeared unbecoming, not to saya citizen, but even a human being. The people considered it an outrageon religion that the dictator's equipage should emulate that of Jupiterand Apollo; and for that single reason his triumph was rather splendidthan pleasing. He then contracted for a temple for queen Juno on MountAventine, and consecrated that of Mother Matuta: and, after havingperformed these services to the gods and to mankind, he laid down hisdictatorship. They then began to consider regarding the offering toApollo; and when Camillus stated that he had vowed the tenth part of thespoil to him, and the pontiff declared that the people ought todischarge their own obligation, a plan was not readily struck out ofordering the people to refund the spoil, so that the due proportionmight be set aside out of it for sacred purposes. At length they hadrecourse to this which seemed the easiest course, that, whoever wishedto acquit himself and his family of the religious obligation, after hehad made his own estimate of his portion of the plunder, should pay intothe treasury the value of the tenth part, so that out of it a goldenoffering worthy of the grandeur of the temple and the divinity of thegod might be made, suitable to the dignity of the Roman people. Thiscontribution also tended to alienate the affections of the commons fromCamillus. During these transactions ambassadors came from the Volsciansand ®quans to sue for peace; and peace was obtained, rather that thestate wearied by so tedious a war might obtain repose, than that thepetitioners were deserving of it."Book 5,Chapter 24,"After the capture of Veii, the following year had six militarytribunes with consular power, the two Publii Cornelii, Cossus andScipio, Marcus Valerius Maximus a second time, K¾so Fabius Ambustus athird time, Lucius Furius Medullinus a fifth time, Quintus Servilius athird time. To the Cornelii the Faliscian war, to Valerius and Serviliusthe Capenatian war, fell by lot. By them no cities were attempted bystorm or by siege, but the country was laid waste, and the plunder ofthe effects on the lands was driven off; not a single fruit tree, not avegetable was left on the land. These losses reduced the people ofCapena; peace was granted to them on their suing for it. The war amongthe Faliscians still continued. At Rome in the mean time sedition becamemultiplied; and for the purpose of assuaging this they resolved that acolony should be sent off to the Volscian country, for which threethousand Roman citizens should be enrolled; and the triumvirs appointedfor the purpose, distributed three acres and seven-twelfths to each man.This donation began to be scorned, because they thought that it wasoffered as a solace for the disappointment of higher hopes. For why werethe commons to be sent into exile to the Volscians, when the magnificentcity of Veii was still in view, and the Veientian territory, morefertile and extensive than the Roman territor? The city also theyextolled as preferable to the city of Rome, both in situation, in thegrandeur of its enclosures, and buildings, both public and private. Nay,even that scheme was proposed, which after the taking of Rome by theGauls was still more strongly urged, of removing to Veii. But theydestined Veii to be inhabited by half the commons and half the senate;and that two cities of one common republic might be inhabited by theRoman people.[167] When the nobles strove against these measures sostrenuously, as to declare ""that they would sooner die in the sight ofthe Roman people, than that any of these things should be put to thevote; for that now in one city there were so many dissensions; whatwould there be in two? Would any one prefer a vanquished to a victoriouscity; and suffer Veii now after being captured to enjoy greaterprosperity than it had before its capture? Lastly, that they may beforsaken in their country by their fellow-citizens; that no power shouldever oblige them to forsake their country and fellow-citizens, andfollow Titus Licinius (for he was the tribune of the commons whoproposed the measure) as a founder to Veii, abandoning the divineRomulus, the son of a god, the parent and founder of the city of Rome.""When these proceedings were going on with shameful contentions, (for thepatricians had drawn over, one half of the tribunes of the commons totheir sentiments,) nothing else obliged the commons to refrain fromviolence, but that whenever a clamour was set up for the purpose ofcommencing a riot, the principal members of the senate, presentingthemselves among the foremost to the crowd, ordered that they themselvesshould be attacked, struck, and put to death. Whilst they abstained fromviolating their age, dignity, and honourable station, their respect forthem checked their rage even with respect to similar attempts on others."Book 5,Chapter 25,"Camillus, at every opportunity and in all places, stated publicly,""that this was not at all surprising; that the state was gone mad;which, though bound by a vow, yet felt greater concern in all othermatters than in acquitting itself of its religious obligations. He wouldsay nothing of the contribution of an alms more strictly speaking thanof a tenth; since each man bound himself in his private capacity by it,the public was set free. However, that his conscience would not permithim to pass this over in silence, that out of that spoil only whichconsisted of movable effects, a tenth was set apart; that no mention wasmade of the city and captured land, which were also included in thevow."" As the discussion of this point seemed difficult to the senate, itwas referred to the pontiffs; Camillus being invited [to the council],the college decided, that whatever had belonged to the Veientians beforethe uttering of the vow, and had come into the power of the Roman peopleafter the vow was made, of that a tenth part was sacred to Apollo. Thusthe city and land were brought into the estimate. The money was issuedfrom the treasury, and the consular tribunes of the soldiers werecommissioned to purchase gold with it. And when there was not asufficient quantity of this [metal], the matrons having held meetings todeliberate on the subject, and by a general resolution having promisedthe military tribunes their gold and all their ornaments, brought theminto the treasury. This circumstance was peculiarly grateful to thesenate, and they say that in return for this generosity the honour wasconferred on the matrons, that they might use covered chariots [whengoing] to public worship and the games, and open chaises on festival andcommon days. A certain weight of gold being received from each andvalued, in order that the price might be paid for it, it was resolvedthat a golden bowl should be made of it, which was to be carried toDelphos as an offering to Apollo. As soon as they disengaged their mindsfrom the religious obligation, the tribunes of the commons renew theirseditious practices; the populace are excited against all the nobles,but above all against Camillus: that ""he by confiscating andconsecrating the plunder of Veii had reduced it to nothing."" The absent[nobles] they abuse in violent terms: they evince a respect for them intheir presence, when they voluntarily presented themselves to theirfury. As soon as they perceived that the business would be protractedbeyond that year, they re-elect as tribunes of the commons for thefollowing year the same abettors of the law; and the patricians stroveto accomplish the same thing with respect to those who were opponents ofthe law. Thus the same persons in a great measure were re-electedtribunes of the commons."Book 5,Chapter 26,"At the election of military tribunes the patricians succeeded bytheir utmost exertions in having Marcus Furius Camillus elected. Theypretended that he was wanted as a commander on account of the wars; buthe was intended as an opponent to the tribunes in their profusion. Themilitary tribunes with consular authority elected with Camillus were,Lucius Furius Medullinus a sixth time, Caius ®milius, Lucius ValeriusPublicola, Spurius Postumius, Publius Cornelius a second time. At thecommencement of the year the tribunes of the commons took not a stepuntil Marcus Furius Camillus should set out to the Faliscians, as thatwar had been assigned to him. Then by delaying the project cooled; andCamillus, whom they chiefly dreaded as an antagonist, acquired anincrease of glory among the Faliscians. For when the enemy at firstconfined themselves within the walls, considering it the safest plan, bylaying waste their lands and burning their houses, he compelled them tocome forth from the city; but their fears prevented them from proceedingto any considerable length. At about a mile from the town they pitchtheir camp; trusting that it was sufficiently secure from no othercause, than the difficulty of the approaches, the roads around beingrough and craggy, in some parts narrow, in others steep. But Camillushaving followed the direction of a prisoner belonging to the country ashis guide, decamping at an advanced hour of the night, at break of dayshows himself on ground considerably higher [than theirs]. The Romansworked at the fortifications in three divisions: the rest of the armystood prepared for battle. There he routs and puts to flight the enemywhen they attempted to interrupt his works; and such terror was struckinto the Faliscians in consequence, that, in their precipitate flightpassing by their own camp which lay in their way, they made for thecity. Many were slain and wounded, before that in their panic they couldmake their way through the gates. Their camp was taken; the spoil wasgiven up to the qu¾stors, to the great dissatisfaction of the soldiers;but overcome by the strictness of his authority, they both hated andadmired the same firmness of conduct. Then a regular siege of the citytook place, and the lines of circumvallation were carried on, andsometimes occasional attacks were made by the townsmen on the Romanposts, and slight skirmishes took place: and the time was spent, no hope[of success] inclining to either side, whilst corn and other provisionswere possessed in much greater abundance by the besieged than thebesiegers from [the store] which had been previously laid in. And theirtoil appeared likely to prove just as tedious as it had at Veii, had notfortune presented to the Roman general at once both an opportunity fordisplaying his virtuous firmness of mind already tested in warlikeaffairs, and a speedy victory."Book 5,Chapter 27,"It was the custom among the Faliscians to employ the same person aspreceptor and private tutor for their children; and, as continues theusage to this day in Greece, several youths were intrusted to the careof one man. The person who appeared to excel in knowledge, instructed,as it is natural to suppose, the children of the leading men. As he hadestablished it as a custom during peace to carry the boys out beyond thecity for the sake of play and of exercise; that custom not having beendiscontinued during the existence of the war; then drawing them awayfrom the gate, sometimes in shorter, sometimes in longer excursions,advancing farther than usual, when an opportunity offered, by varyingtheir play and conversation, he led them on between the enemy's guards,and thence to the Roman camp into his tent to Camillus. There to theatrocious act he added a still more atrocious speech: that ""he haddelivered Falerii into the hands of the Romans, when he put into theirpower those children, whose parents are there at the head of affairs.""When Camillus heard this, he says, ""Wicked as thou art, thou hast comewith thy villanous offering neither to a people nor a commander likethyself. Between us and the Faliscians there exists not that form ofsociety which is established by human compact; but between both theredoes exist, and ever will exist, that which nature has implanted. Thereare laws of war as well of peace; and we have learned to wage themjustly not less than bravely. We carry arms not against that age whichis spared even when towns are taken, but against men who are themselvesarmed, and who, not having been injured or provoked by us, attacked theRoman camp at Veii. Those thou hast surpassed, as far as lay in you, byan unprecedented act of villany: I shall conquer them, as I did Veii, byRoman arts, by bravery, labour, and by arms."" Then having stripped himnaked, and tied his hands behind his back, he delivered him up to theboys to be brought back to Falerii; and supplied them with rods toscourge the traitor and drive him into the city. At which spectacle, acrowd of people being assembled, afterwards the senate being convened bythe magistrates on the extraordinary circumstance, so great a change wasproduced in their sentiments, that the entire state earnestly demandedpeace at the hands of those, who lately, outrageous by hatred and anger,almost preferred the fate of the Veientians to the peace of theCapenatians. The Roman faith, the justice of the commander, are cried upin the forum and in the senate-house; and by universal consentambassadors set out to the camp to Camillus, and thence by permission ofCamillus to Rome to the senate, in order to deliver up Falerii. Whenintroduced before the senate, they are represented as having spokenthus: ""Conscript fathers, overcome by you and your commander by avictory at which neither god nor man can feel displeasure, we surrenderourselves to you, considering that we shall live more happily under yourrule than under our own law, than which nothing can be more glorious fora conqueror. In the result of this war, two salutary examples have beenexhibited to mankind. You preferred faith in war to present victory: we,challenged by your good faith, have voluntarily given up to you thevictory. We are under your sovereignty. Send men to receive our arms,our hostages, our city with its gates thrown open. You shall never haveto repent of our fidelity, nor we of your dominion."" Thanks werereturned to Camillus both by the enemy and by his own countrymen. Moneywas required of the Faliscians to pay off the soldiers for that year,that the Roman people might be relieved from the tribute. Peace beinggranted, the army was led back to Rome."Book 5,Chapter 28,"When Camillus returned home, signalized by much more solid glorythan when white horses had drawn him through the city, having vanquishedthe enemy by justice and good faith, the senate did not conceal theirsense of respect for him, but immediately set about acquitting him ofhis vow; and Lucius Valerius, Lucius Sergius, Aulus Manlius, being sentin a ship of war as ambassadors to carry the golden bowl to Delphos asan offering to Apollo, were intercepted by the pirates of the Liparensesnot far from the Sicilian Strait, and carried to Lipar¾. It was thecustom of the state to make a division of all booty which was acquired,as it were, by public piracy. On that year it so happened that oneTimasitheus filled the office of chief magistrate, a man more like theRomans than his own countrymen. Who, himself reverencing the name ofambassadors, and the offering, and the god to whom it was sent, and thecause of the offering, impressed the multitude also, who almost on alloccasions resemble their ruler, with [a sense] of religious justice; andafter having brought the ambassadors to a public entertainment, escortedthem with the protection of some ships to Delphos, and from thencebrought them back in safety to Rome. By a decree of the senate a leagueof hospitality was formed with him, and presents were conferred on himby the state. During the same year the war with the ®quans wasconducted with varying success; so that it was a matter of doubt bothamong the troops themselves and at Rome, whether they had beenvictorious or were vanquished. The Roman commanders were Caius ®miliusand Spurius Postumius, two of the military tribunes. At first they actedin conjunction; then, after the enemy were routed in the field, it wasagreed that ®milius should take possession of Verrugo with a certainforce, and that Postumius should devastate the country. There, as thelatter proceeded rather negligently, and with his troops irregularlydrawn up, he was attacked by the ®quans, and an alarm being occasioned,he was driven to the nearest hill; and the panic spread from thence toVerrugo to the other detachment of the army. When Postumius, havingwithdrawn his men to a place of safety, summoned an assembly andupbraided them with their fright and flight; with having been beaten bya most cowardly and dastardly enemy; the entire army shout aloud thatthey deserved to hear all this, and admitted the disgrace they hadincurred; but [they promised] that they would make amends, and that theenemy's joy should not be of long duration. Demanding that he wouldinstantly lead them from thence to the camp of the enemy, (this lay inthe plain within their view,) they submitted to any punishment, if theydid not take it before night. Having praised them, he orders them totake refreshment, and to be in readiness at the fourth watch. And theenemy, in order to prevent the flight of the Romans from the hillthrough the road which led to Verrugo, were posted to meet them; and thebattle commenced before daylight, (but the moon was up all the night,)and was not more confused than a battle fought by day. But the shouthaving reached Verrugo, when they thought that the Roman camp wasattacked, occasioned such a panic, that in spite of the entreaties of®milius and his efforts to stop them, they fled to Tusculum in greatdisorder. From thence a report was carried to Rome that ""Postumius andhis army were cut to pieces."" When the dawn of day had removed allapprehension of an ambuscade in case of a hasty pursuit, after ridingthrough the ranks, by demanding [the performance of] their promises heinfused such ardour into them, that the ®quans could no longer withstandtheir impetuosity. Then the slaughter of them in their flight, such astakes place when matters are conducted more under the influence ofanger than of courage, was continued even to the total destruction ofthe enemy, and the melancholy news from Tusculum, the state having beenalarmed without cause, was followed by a letter from Postumius deckedwith laurel, (announcing) that ""the victory belonged to the Romanpeople; that the army of the ®quans was destroyed."""Book 5,Chapter 29,"As the proceedings of the plebeian tribunes had not yet attained atermination, both the commons exerted themselves to continue theiroffice for the promoters of the law, and the patricians to re-elect theopponents of the law; but the commons were more successful in theelection of their own magistrates. Which annoyance the patriciansavenged by passing a decree of the senate that consuls should beelected, magistrates detested by the commons. After an interval offifteen years, Lucius Lucretius Flavus and Servius Sulpicius Camerinuswere appointed consuls. In the beginning of this year, whilst thetribunes of the commons united their efforts to pass the law, becausenone of their college were likely to oppose them, and the consulsresisted them with no less energy, the ®quans storm Vitellia, a Romancolony in their territory. The chief part of the colonists made theirway in safety to Rome, because the town, having been taken by treacheryin the night, afforded an unimpeded mode of escape by the remote side ofthe city. That province fell to the lot of Lucius Lucretius the consul.He having set out with his army, vanquished the enemy in the field; andreturned victorious to Rome to a much more serious contest. A day oftrial had been appointed for Aulus Virginius and Quintus Pomponius,plebeian tribunes of the two preceding years, in whose defence by thecombined power of the patricians, the honour of the senate was involved.For no one laid against them any other impeachment, either of their modeof life or of their conduct in office, save that, to gratify thepatricians, they had protested against the tribunitian law. Theresentment of the commons, however, prevailed over the influence of thesenate; and by a most pernicious precedent these men, though innocent,were condemned [to pay a fine of] ten thousand _asses_ in weight. Atthis the patricians were very much incensed. Camillus openly charged thecommons with gross violation of duty, ""who, now turning their venomagainst their own body, did not feel that by their iniquitous sentenceon the tribune they abolished the right of protesting; that abolishingthis right of protesting, they had upset the tribunitian authority. Forthey were mistaken in expecting that the patricians would tolerate theunbridled licentiousness of that office. If tribunitian violence couldnot be repelled by tribunitian aid, that the patricians would find outsome other weapon."" The consuls he also blamed, because they had insilence suffered those tribunes who had followed the authority of thesenate to be deceived by [their reliance] on the public faith. By openlyexpressing these sentiments, he every day still further exasperated theangry feelings of the people."Book 5,Chapter 30,"But he ceased not to urge the senate to oppose the law; ""that whenthe day for proposing the law had arrived they should go down to theforum with no other feeling than as men who remembered that they had tocontend for their altars and homes, and the temples of the gods, and thesoil in which they had been born. For that as far as he himselfindividually was concerned, if during this contest [to be sustained] byhis country it were allowable for him to think of his own glory, itwould even reflect honour on himself, that a city captured by him shouldbe densely inhabited, that he would daily enjoy the monument of hisglory, and that he would have before his eyes a city borne by him in histriumph, that all would tread in the footsteps of his renown. But thathe deemed it an impiety that a city deserted and forsaken by theimmortal gods should be inhabited; that the Roman people should residein a captive soil, and that a vanquished should be taken in exchange fora victorious country."" Stimulated by these exhortations of their leader,the patricians, both young and old, entered the forum in a body, whenthe law was about to be proposed: and dispersing themselves through thetribes, each earnestly appealing to the members of their own tribe,began to entreat them with tears ""not to desert that country for whichthey themselves and their fathers had fought most valiantly andsuccessfully,"" pointing to the Capitol, the temple of Vesta, and theother temples of the gods around; ""not to drive the Roman people, exilesand outcasts, from their native soil and household gods into the city ofthe enemy; and not to bring matters to such a state, that it was betterthat Veii were not taken, lest Rome should be deserted."" Because theyproceeded not by violence, but by entreaties, and in the midst of theseentreaties frequent mention was [made] of the gods, the greatest part[of the people] were influenced by religious scruples: and more tribesby one rejected the law than voted for it. And so gratifying was thisvictory to the patricians, that on the following day, on a motion madeby the consuls, a decree of the senate was passed, that seven acres aman of Veientian territory should be distributed to the commons; and notonly to the fathers of families, but so that all persons in their housein a state of freedom should be considered, and that they might bewilling to rear up their children with that prospect."Book 5,Chapter 31,"The commons being won over by such a boon, no opposition was made toholding the elections for consuls. Lucius Valerius Potitus, and MarcusManlius, who afterwards obtained the surname of Capitolinus, wereelected consuls. These consuls celebrated the great games which MarcusFurius, when dictator, had vowed in the Veientian war. In the same yearthe temple of imperial Juno, vowed by the same dictator and during thesame war, is dedicated; and they state that the dedication was attendedwith great zeal by the matrons. A war scarcely worth mentioning waswaged with the ®quans at Algidum, the enemies taking to flight almostbefore they commenced the fight. To Valerius, because he was morepersevering in slaughtering them in their flight, a triumph was granted;it was decreed that Manlius should enter the city with an ovation. Thesame year a new war broke out with the Volsinians; whither an army couldnot be led, on account of a famine and pestilence in the Romanterritories, which arose from drought and excessive heat; on account ofwhich the Volsinians forming a junction with the Salpinians, beingelated with pride, made an unprovoked incursion into the Romanterritories. War was then proclaimed against the two states. CaiusJulius died during his censorship; Marcus Cornelius was substituted inhis room; a proceeding which was afterwards considered as offensive toreligion; because during that lustrum Rome was taken. Nor since thattime has a censor ever been substituted in the room of one deceased. Andthe consuls being seized by the distemper, it was determined that theauspices should be taken anew during an interregnum."Book 5,Chapter 32,"Therefore when in pursuance of a decree of the senate the consulsresigned their office, Marcus Furius Camillus is created interrex, whoappointed Publius Cornelius Scipio interrex, and he afterwards LuciusValerius Potitus. By him were appointed six military tribunes withconsular power; so that, though any one of them should be incommoded bybad health, the state might have a sufficient number of magistrates. Onthe calends of July, the following entered on their office, LuciusLucretius, Servius Sulpicius, Marcus ®milius, Lucius Furius Medullinus aseventh time, Agrippa Furius, Caius ®milius a second time. Of these,Lucius Lucretius and Caius ®milius got the Volsinians as their province;the Salpinians fell to the lot of Agrippa Furius and Servius Sulpicius.The first engagement was with the Volsinians. The war, important fromthe number of the enemy, was without difficulty brought to a close. Atthe first onset, their army was put to flight. Eight thousand soldiers,hemmed in by the cavalry, laid down their arms and surrendered. Theaccount received of that war had the effect of preventing the Salpiniansfrom hazarding an engagement; the troops secured themselves within theirtowns. The Romans drove spoil in every direction, both from theSalpinian and Volsinian territory, there being no one to repel thataggression; until a truce for twenty years was granted to theVolsinians, exhausted by the war, on this condition, that they shouldmake restitution to the Roman people, and furnish the pay of the armyfor that year. During the same year, Marcus C¾dicius, a plebeian,announced to the tribunes that in the New Street, where the chapel nowstands, above the temple of Vesta, he had heard in the silence of thenight a voice louder than that of a human being, which ordered themagistrates to be told, that the Gauls were approaching. This, as isusual, was disregarded, on account of the humble station of the author,and also because the nation was a remote one, and therefore the lessknown. And not only were the warnings of the gods disregarded, fate nowimpending; but further, the only human aid which was left them, MarcusFurius, they drove away from the city; who, on a day [of trial] beingappointed for him by Lucius Appuleius, a tribune of the people, inreference to the Veientian spoil, he having also lost his son, a youngman, about the same time, when he summoned to his house the members ofhis tribe and his dependents, (they constituted a considerable portionof the commons,) and having sounded their sentiments, he received foranswer, ""that they would contribute whatever fine he should be condemnedto pay; that to acquit him they were unable,""[168] retired into exile;after praying to the immortal gods, ""that if that outrage was done tohim without his deserving it, they would at the earliest opportunitygive cause to his ungrateful country to regret his absence."" In hisabsence he was fined fifteen thousand _asses_ in weight."Book 5,Chapter 33,"That citizen being driven away, who being present, Rome could not becaptured, if any thing is certain regarding human affairs; the destinedruin now approaching the city, ambassadors came from the Clusinians,soliciting aid against the Gauls. A report is current that that nation,allured by the delightfulness of the crops, and more especially of thewine, an enjoyment then new to them, crossed the Alps, and tookpossession of the lands formerly cultivated by the Etrurians; and thatAruns, a native of Clusium, introduced wine into Gaul for the purpose ofenticing the nation, through resentment for his wife's having beendebauched by Lucumo, whose guardian he himself had been, a veryinfluential young man, and on whom vengeance could not be taken, unlessforeign aid were resorted to; that this person served as a guide to themwhen crossing the Alps, and advised them to lay siege to Clusium. Iwould not indeed deny that the Gauls were brought to Clusium by Aruns orany other native of Clusium; but that those persons who laid siege toClusium were not they who first crossed the Alps, is sufficientlycertain. For two hundred years before they laid siege to Clusium andcaptured the city of Rome, the Gauls passed over into Italy. Nor werethese the first of the Etrurians with whom the Gauls fought, but longbefore that they frequently fought with those who dwelt between theApennines and the Alps. Before the Roman empire the sway of the Tuscanswas much extended by land and by sea; how very powerful they were inthe upper and lower seas, by which Italy is encompassed like an island,the names [of these seas] is a proof; the one of which the Italiannations have called the Tuscan sea, the general appellation of thepeople; the other the Hadriatic, from Hadria, a colony of Tuscans. TheGreeks call these same seas the Tyrrhenian and Hadriatic. This peopleinhabited the country extending to both seas in twelve cities, coloniesequal in number to the mother cities having been sent, first on thisside the Apennines towards the lower sea, afterwards to the other sideof the Apennines; who obtained possession of all the district beyond thePo, even as far as the Alps, except the corner of the Venetians, whodwell round the extreme point of the [Hadriatic] sea. The Alpine nationsalso have this origin, more especially the Rh¾tians; whom their verysituation has rendered savage, so as to retain nothing of theiroriginal, except the accent of their language, and not even that withoutcorruption."Book 5,Chapter 34,"Concerning the passage of the Gauls into Italy we have heard asfollows. In the reign of Tarquinius Priscus at Rome, the supremegovernment of the Celts, who compose the third part of Gaul, was in thehands of the Biturigians: they gave a king to the Celtic nation. Thiswas Ambigatus, one very much distinguished by his merit, and both hisgreat prosperity in his own concerns and in those of the public; forunder his administration Gaul was so fruitful and so well peopled, thatso very great a population appeared scarcely capable of being restrainedby any government. He being now advanced in years, and anxious torelieve his kingdom of so oppressive a crowd, declares his intention tosend his sister's sons, Bellovesus and Sigovesus, two enterprisingyouths, into whatever settlements the gods should grant them by augury:that they should take out with them as great a number of men as theypleased, so that no nation might be able to obstruct them in theirprogress. Then to Sigovesus the Hercynian forest was assigned by theoracle: to Bellovesus the gods marked out a much more cheering routeinto Italy. He carried out with him from the Biturigians, theArvernians, the Senonians, the ®duans, the Ambarrians, the Carnutians,and the Aulercians, all that was superfluous in their population. Havingset out with an immense force of horse and foot, he arrived in thecountry of the Tricastinians. Next the Alps were opposed [to theirprogress], and I am not surprised that they should seem impassable, asthey had never been climbed over through any path as yet, as far atleast as tradition can extend, unless we are disposed to believe thestories regarding Hercules. When the height of the mountains kept theGauls there penned up as it were, and they were looking around [todiscover] by what path they might pass into another world between thesummits, which joined the sky, a religious scruple detained them, ithaving been announced to them that strangers in search of lands wereattacked by the nation of the Salyans. These were the Massilians, whohad come by sea from Phoc¾a. The Gauls considering this an omen of theirown fortune, assisted them in fortifying the ground which they had takenpossession of on their first landing, covered with spacious woods. Theythemselves crossed the Alps through the Taurinian and pathless forests;and having defeated the Etrurians not far from the Ticinus, on hearingthat the land in which they had posted themselves was called Insubria,the same name as the Insubres, a canton of the ®dui: embracing the omenof the place, they built a city there, and called it Mediolanum."Book 5,Chapter 35,"Some time after another body, consisting of Cenomanians, havingfollowed the tracks of the former under the conduct of Elitovius,crossed the Alps through the same forest, with the aid of Bellovesus,and settle themselves where the cities of Brixia and Verona now stand(the Libuans then possessed these places). After these came theSalluvians, who fix themselves near the ancient canton of the Ligurianscalled L¾vi, inhabiting the banks of the Ticinus. Next the Boians andLingonians, having made their way over through the Penine pass, all thetract between the Po and the Alps being occupied, crossed the Po onrafts, and drove out of the country not only the Etrurians, but theUmbrians also: they confined themselves however within the Apennines.Then the Senonians, the latest of these emigrants, took possession ofthe track [extending] from the Utens to the ®sis. I find that it wasthis nation that came to Clusium, and thence to Rome; whether alone, oraided by all the nations of the Cisalpine Gauls, is not dulyascertained. The Clusians, terrified at their strange enemy, onbeholding their great numbers, the forms of the men such as they hadnever seen, and the kind of arms [they carried], and on hearing thatthe troops of the Etrurians had been frequently defeated by them on bothsides of the Po, sent ambassadors to Rome to solicit aid from thesenate, though they had no claim on the Roman people, in respect eitherof alliance or friendship, except that they had not defended theirrelations the Veientians against the Roman people. No aid was obtained:three ambassadors were sent, sons of Marcus Fabius Ambustus, to treatwith the Gauls in the name of the senate and Roman people; that theyshould not attack the allies and friends of the Roman people from whomthey had received no wrong. That they should be supported by the Romanseven by force of arms, if circumstances obliged them; but it seemedbetter that war itself should be kept aloof, if possible; and that theGauls, a nation strangers to them, should be known by peace, rather thanby arms."Book 5,Chapter 36,"The embassy was a mild one, had it not been consigned to ambassadorstoo hot in temper, and who resembled Gauls more than Romans. To whom,after they delivered their commission in the assembly of the Gauls, thefollowing answer is returned: Though the name of the Romans was new totheir ears, yet they believed them to be brave men, whose aid wasimplored by the Clusians in their perilous conjuncture. And since theychose to defend their allies against them by negociation rather than byarms, that they on their part would not reject the pacific terms whichthey propose, if the Clusians would give up to the Gauls in want ofland, a portion of their territories which they possessed to a greaterextent than they could cultivate; otherwise peace could not be obtained:that they wished to receive an answer in presence of the Romans; and ifthe land were refused them, that they would decide the matter with thesword in presence of the same Romans; that they might have anopportunity of carrying home an account how much the Gauls excelled allother mortals in bravery. On the Romans asking what right they had todemand land from the possessors, or to threaten war [in case ofrefusal], and what business the Gauls had in Etruria, and on theirfiercely replying, that they carried their right in their swords, thatall things were the property of the brave, with minds inflamed on bothsides they severally have recourse to arms, and the battle is commenced.Here, fate now pressing hard on the Roman city, the ambassadors,contrary to the law of nations, take up arms; nor could this be done insecret, as three of the noblest and bravest of the Roman youth fought inthe van of the Etrurians; so conspicuous was the valour of theforeigners. Moreover Quintus Fabius, riding out beyond the line, slew ageneral of the Gauls who was furiously charging the very standards ofthe Etrurians, having run him through the side with his spear: and theGauls recognised him when stripping him of his spoils; and a signal wasgiven throughout the entire line that he was a Roman ambassador. Givingup therefore their resentment against the Clusians, they sound aretreat, threatening the Romans. Some gave it as their opinion that theyshould proceed forthwith to Rome. The seniors prevailed, thatambassadors should be sent to complain of the injuries done them, and todemand that the Fabii should be given up to them in satisfaction forhaving violated the law of nations. When the ambassadors had statedmatters, according to the instructions given to them, the conduct of theFabii was neither approved by the senate, and the barbarians seemed tothem to demand what was just: but in the case of men of such stationparty favour prevented them from decreeing that which they felt to beright. Wherefore lest the blame of any misfortune, which might happen tobe received in a war with the Gauls, should lie with them, they referthe consideration of the demands of the Gauls to the people, whereinfluence and wealth were so predominant, that those persons, whosepunishment was under consideration, were elected military tribunes withconsular power for the ensuing year. At which proceeding the Gauls beingenraged, as was very natural, openly menacing war, return to their ownparty. With the three Fabii the military tribunes elected were QuintusSulpicius Longus, Quintus Servilius a fourth time, Servius CorneliusMaluginensis."Book 5,Chapter 37,"Though danger of such magnitude was impending (so completely doesFortune blind the minds of men when she wishes not her threateningstroke to be foiled) a state, which against the Fidenatian and Veientianenemies, and other neighbouring states, had recourse to aid even fromthe most extreme quarters, and had appointed a dictator on many tryingoccasions, that same state now, when an enemy, never before seen orheard of, from the ocean and remotest regions of the earth, wasadvancing in arms against them, looked not for any extraordinary commandor aid. Tribunes, by whose temerity the war had been brought on them,were appointed to the chief direction of affairs, and even making lessof the war than fame had represented it, held the levy with no greaterdiligence than used to be exercised for ordinary wars. In the mean whilethe Gauls, on hearing that honour was even conferred on the violators ofhuman law, and that their embassy was slighted, inflamed withresentment, over which that nation has no control, immediately snatchedup their standards, and enter on their march with the utmost expedition.When the cities, alarmed at the tumult occasioned by them as they passedprecipitately along, began to run to arms, and the peasants took toflight, they indicated by a loud shout that they were proceeding toRome, taking up an immense space of ground, wherever they passed, withtheir horses and men, their troops spreading widely in every direction.But fame and the messengers of the Clusians, and then of the otherstates one after another, preceding them, the rapid advance of the enemybrought the greatest consternation to Rome; for, with their tumultuarytroops hastily led on, they met them within the distance of the eleventhmile-stone, where the river Allia, descending from the Crustuminianmountains in a very deep channel, joins the river Tiber not far belowthe road. Already all places in front and on each side were crowded withthe enemy, and this nation, which has a natural turn for causelessconfusion, by their harsh music and discordant clamours, filled allplaces with a horrible din."Book 5,Chapter 38,"There the military tribunes, without having previously selected aplace for their camp, without having previously raised a rampart towhich they might have a retreat, unmindful of their duty to the gods, tosay nothing of that to man, without taking auspices or offeringsacrifices, draw up their line, which was extended towards the flanks,lest they should be surrounded by the great numbers of the enemy. Stilltheir front could not be made equal to that of the enemy, though bythinning their line they rendered their centre weak and scarcelyconnected. There was on the right a small eminence, which it wasdetermined to fill with bodies of reserve; and that circumstance, as itwas the first cause of their dismay and flight, so it proved their onlymeans of safety in their flight. For Brennus, the chieftain of theGauls, being chiefly apprehensive of some design[169] being intended inthe small number of the enemy, thinking that the high ground had beenseized for this purpose, that, when the Gauls had been engaged in frontwith the line of the legions, the reserve was to make an attack on theirrear and flank, directed his troops against the reserve; certain, thatif he had dislodged them from their ground, the victory would be easy inthe plain for a force which had so much the advantage in point ofnumbers: thus not only fortune, but judgment also stood on the side ofthe barbarians. In the opposite army there appeared nothing like Romans,either in the commanders, or in the soldiers. Terror and dismay hadtaken possession of their minds, and such a forgetfulness of everything, that a far greater number of them fled to Veii, a city of theirenemy, though the Tiber stood in their way, than by the direct road toRome, to their wives and children. Their situation defended the reservefor some time; throughout the remainder of the line as soon as the shoutwas heard, by those who stood nearest on their flank, and by those at adistance on their rear, almost before they could look at the enemy asyet untried, not only without attempting to fight, but without evenreturning the shout, fresh and unhurt they took to flight. Nor was thereany slaughter of them in the act of fighting; but their rear was cut topieces, whilst they obstructed their flight by their struggling one withanother. Great slaughter was made on the bank of the Tiber, whither theentire left wing, having thrown down their arms, directed their flight;and many who did not know how to swim, or were exhausted, being weigheddown by their coats of mail and other defensive armour, were swallowedup in the current. The greatest part however escaped safe to Veii;whence not only no reinforcement, but not even an account of theirdefeat, was forwarded to Rome. Those on the right wing which had beenposted at a distance from the river, and rather near the foot of themountain, all made for Rome, and, without even shutting the gates, fledinto the citadel."Book 5,Chapter 39,"The miraculous attainment of so sudden a victory held even the Gaulsin a state of stupefaction. And at first they stood motionless withpanic, as if not knowing what had happened; then they apprehended astratagem; at length they began to collect the spoils of the slain, andto pile up the arms in heaps, as is their custom. Then, at length, whenno appearance of any thing hostile was any where observed, havingproceeded on their journey, they reach the city of Rome not long beforesun-set: where when some horsemen, who had advanced before, brought backword that the gates were not shut, that no guard was posted before thegates, no armed troops on the walls, another cause of amazement similarto the former made them halt; and dreading the night and ignorance ofthe situation of the city, they posted themselves between Rome and theAnio, after sending scouts about the walls and the several gates toascertain what plans the enemy would adopt in their desperatecircumstances. With respect to the Romans, as the greater part had goneto Veii from the field of battle, and no one supposed that any survivedexcept those who had fled back to Rome, being all lamented as lost, boththose living and those dead, they caused the entire city to be filledwith wailings. The alarm for the public interest stifled private sorrow,as soon as it was announced that the enemy were at hand. Presently thebarbarians patrolling around the walls in troops, they heard their yellsand the dissonant clangour of their arms. All the interval up to thenext day kept their minds in such a state of suspense, that an assaultseemed every moment about to be made on the city: on their firstapproach, when they arrived at the city, [it was expected;] for if thiswere not their design, that they would have remained at the Allia; thentowards sunset, because there was not much of the day remaining, theyimagined that they would attack them before night; then that the designwas deferred until night, in order to strike the greater terror. Atlength the approach of light struck them with dismay; and the calamityitself followed closely upon their continued apprehension of it, whenthe troops entered the gates in hostile array. During that night,however, and the following day, the state by no means bore anyresemblance to that which which had fled in so dastardly a manner at theAllia. For as there was not a hope that the city could be defended, sosmall a number of troops now remaining, it was determined that theyouth fit for military service, and the abler part of the senate withtheir wives and children, should retire into the citadel and Capitol;and having collected stores of arms and corn, and thence from afortified post, that they should defend the deities, and theinhabitants, and the Roman name: that the flamen [Quirinalis] and thevestal priestesses should carry away far from slaughter andconflagration the objects appertaining to the religion of the state: andthat their worship should not be intermitted, until there remained noone who should continue it. If the citadel and Capitol, the mansion ofthe gods, if the senate, the source of public counsel, if the youth ofmilitary age, should survive the impending ruin of the city, the losswould be light of the aged, the crowd left behind in the city, and whowere sure to perish[170] under any circumstances. And in order that theplebeian portion of the multitude might bear the thing with greaterresignation, the aged men, who had enjoyed triumphs and consulships,openly declared that they would die along with them, and that they wouldnot burden the scanty stores of the armed men with those bodies, withwhich they were now unable to bear arms, or to defend their country.Such was the consolation addressed to each other by the aged nowdestined to death."Book 5,Chapter 40,"Their exhortations were then turned to the band of young men, whomthey escorted to the Capitol and citadel, commending to their valour andyouth whatever might be the remaining fortune of a city, which for threehundred and sixty years had been victorious in all its wars. When thosewho carried with them all their hope and resources, parted with theothers, who had determined not to survive the ruin of their capturedcity; both the circumstance itself and the appearance [it exhibited] wasreally distressing, and also the weeping of the women, and theirundecided running together, following now these, now those, and askingtheir husbands and children what was to become of them, [all together]left nothing that could be added to human misery. A great many of them,however, escorted their friends into the citadel, no one eitherpreventing or inviting them; because the measure which was advantageousto the besieged, that of reducing the number of useless persons, was butlittle in accordance with humanity. The rest of the crowd, chieflyplebeians, whom so small a hill could not contain, nor could they besupported amid such a scarcity of corn, pouring out of the city as if inone continued train, repaired to the Janiculum. From thence some weredispersed through the country, some made for the neighbouring cities,without any leader or concert, following each his own hopes, his ownplans, those of the public being given up as lost. In the mean time theFlamen Quirinalis and the vestal virgins, laying aside all concern fortheir own affairs, consulting which of the sacred deposits should becarried with them, which should be left behind, for they had notstrength to carry them all, or what place would best preserve them insafe custody, consider it best to put them into casks and to bury themin the chapel adjoining to the residence of the Flamen Quirinalis, wherenow it is profane to spit out. The rest they carry away with them, afterdividing the burden among themselves, by the road which leads by theSublician bridge to the Janiculum. When Lucius Albinius, a Romanplebeian, who was conveying his wife and children in a waggon, beheldthem on that ascent among the rest of the crowd which was leaving thecity as unfit to carry arms; even then the distinction of things divineand human being preserved, considering it an outrage on religion, thatthe public priests and sacred utensils of the Roman people should go onfoot and be carried, that he and his family should be seen in acarriage, he commanded his wife and children to alight, placed thevirgins and sacred utensils in the vehicle, and carried them on to C¾re,whither the priests had intended to go."Book 5,Chapter 41,"Meanwhile at Rome all arrangements being now made, as far as waspossible in such an emergency, for the defence of the citadel, the crowdof aged persons having returned to their houses, awaited the enemy'scoming with minds firmly prepared for death. Such of them as had bornecurule offices, in order that they may die in the insignia of theirformer station, honours, and merit, arraying themselves in the mostmagnificent garments worn by those drawing the chariots of the gods inprocession, or by persons riding in triumph, seated themselves in theirivory chairs, in the middle of their halls. Some say that they devotedthemselves for their country and the citizens of Rome, Marcus Fabius,the chief pontiff, dictating the form of words. The Gauls, both becauseby the intervention of the night they had abated all angry feelingsarising from the irritation of battle, and because they had on nooccasion fought a well-disputed fight, and were then not taking the cityby storm or violence, entering the city the next day, free fromresentment or heat of passion, through the Colline gate which lay open,advance into the forum, casting their eyes around on the temples of thegods, and on the citadel, which alone exhibited any appearance of war.From thence, after leaving a small guard, lest any attack should be madeon them whilst scattered, from the citadel or Capitol, they dispersed inquest of plunder; the streets being entirely desolate, rush some of themin a body into the houses that were nearest; some repair to those whichwere most distant, considering these to be untouched and abounding withspoil. Afterwards being terrified by the very solitude, lest anystratagem of the enemy should surprise them whilst being dispersed, theyreturned in bodies into the forum and the parts adjoining to the forum,where the houses of the commons being shut, and the halls of the leadingmen lying open, almost greater backwardness was felt to attack the openthan the shut houses; so completely did they behold with a sort ofveneration men sitting in the porches of the palaces, who besides theirornaments and apparel more august than human, bore a strikingresemblance to gods, in the majesty which their looks and the gravity oftheir countenance displayed. Whilst they stood gazing on these as onstatues, it is said that Marcus Papirius, one of them, roused the angerof a Gaul by striking him on the head with his ivory, while he wasstroking his beard, which was then universally worn long; and that thecommencement of the bloodshed began with him, that the rest were slainin their seats. After the slaughter of the nobles, no person whateverwas spared; the houses were plundered, and when emptied were set onfire."Book 5,Chapter 42,"But whether it was that all were not possessed with a desire ofdestroying the city, or it had been so determined by the leading men ofthe Gauls, both that some fires should be presented to their view, [tosee] if the besieged could be forced into a surrender through affectionfor their dwellings, and that all the houses should not be burned down,so that whatever portion should remain of the city, they might hold asa pledge to work upon the minds of the enemy; the fire by no meansspread either indiscriminately or extensively on the first day, as isusual in a captured city. The Romans beholding from the citadel the cityfilled with the enemy, and their running to and fro through all thestreets, some new calamity presenting itself in every different quarter,were neither able to preserve their presence of mind, nor even to haveperfect command of their ears and eyes. To whatever direction the shoutsof the enemy, the cries of women and children, the crackling of theflames, and the crash of falling houses, had called their attention,thither, terrified at every incident, they turned their thoughts, faces,and eyes, as if placed by fortune to be spectators of their fallingcountry, and as if left as protectors of no other of their effects,except their own persons: so much more to be commiserated than anyothers who were ever besieged, because, shut out from their country,they were besieged, beholding all their effects in the power of theenemy. Nor was the night, which succeeded so shockingly spent a day,more tranquil; daylight then followed a restless night; nor was thereany time which failed to produce the sight of some new disaster. Loadedand overwhelmed by so many evils, they did not at all abate theirdetermination, [resolved,] though they should see every thing in flamesand levelled to the dust, to defend by their bravery the hill which theyoccupied, small and ill provided as it was, being left [as a refuge] forliberty. And now, as the same events recurred every day, as ifhabituated to misfortunes, they abstracted their thoughts from allfeeling of their circumstances, regarding their arms only, and theswords in their right hands, as the sole remnants of their hopes."Book 5,Chapter 43,"The Gauls also, after having for several days waged an ineffectualwar against the buildings of the city, when they saw that among thefires and ruins of the captured city nothing now remained except armedenemies, neither terrified by so many disasters, nor likely to turntheir thoughts to a surrender, unless force were employed, determine tohave recourse to extremities, and to make an attack on the citadel. Asignal being given at break of day, their entire multitude is marshalledin the forum; thence, after raising the shout and forming a testudo,they advance to the attack. Against whom the Romans, acting neitherrashly nor precipitately, having strengthened the guards at everyapproach, and opposing the main strength of their men in that quarterwhere they saw the battalions advancing, suffer the enemy to ascend,judging that the higher they ascended, the more easily would they bedriven back down the steep. About the middle of the ascent they metthem: and making a charge thence from the higher ground, which of itselfbore them against the enemy, they routed the Gauls with slaughter anddestruction, so that never after, either in parties or with their wholeforce, did they try that kind of fighting. Laying aside all hope ofsucceeding by force of arms, they prepare for a blockade; of whichhaving had no idea up to that time, they had, whilst burning the city,destroyed whatever corn had been therein, and during those very days allthe provisions had been carried off from the land to Veii. Accordingly,dividing their army, they resolved that one part should plunder throughthe neighbouring states, that the other part should carry on the siegeof the citadel, so that the ravagers of the country might supply thebesiegers with corn."Book 5,Chapter 44,"The Gauls, who marched from the city, were led by fortune herself,to make trial of Roman valour, to Ardea, where Camillus was in exile:who, more distressed by the fortune of the public than his own, whilsthe now pined away arraigning gods and men, fired with indignation, andwondering where were now those men who with him had taken Veii andFalerii, who had conducted other wars rather by their own valour than bythe favour of fortune, hears on a sudden that the army of the Gauls wasapproaching, and that the people of Ardea in consternation were met incouncil on the subject. And as if moved by divine inspiration, after headvanced into the midst of the assembly, having hitherto been accustomedto absent himself from such meetings, he says, ""People of Ardea, myfriends of old, of late my fellow-citizens also, since your kindness soordered it, and my good fortune achieved it, let no one of you supposethat I have come forward here forgetful of my condition; but the[present] case and the common danger obliges every one to contribute tothe common good whatever service he can in our present alarmingsituation. And when shall I repay you for your so very importantservices to me, if I now be remiss? or where will you derive benefitfrom me, if not in war? By this accomplishment I maintained my rank inmy native country: and, unconquered in war, I was banished during peaceby my ungrateful fellow-citizens. To you, men of Ardea, a favourableopportunity has been presented of making a return for all the formerfavours conferred by the Roman people, such as you yourselves remember,(for which reason, as being mindful of them, you are not to be upbraidedwith them,) and of obtaining great military renown for this your cityover the common enemy. The nation, which now approaches in disorderlymarch, is one to which nature has given great spirits and bodies ratherhuge than firm. Let the disaster of Rome serve as a proof. They capturedthe city when lying open to them; a small handful of men from thecitadel and Capitol withstand them. Already tired out by the slowprocess of a siege, they retire and spread themselves through thecountry. Gorged with food and wine hastily swallowed, when night comeson they stretch themselves indiscriminately, like brutes, near streamsof water, without entrenchment, without guards or advanced posts; moreincautious even now than usual in consequence of success. If you thenare disposed to defend your own walls, and not to suffer all theseplaces to become Gaul, take up arms in a full body at the first watch:follow me to slaughter, not to battle. If I do not deliver them up toyou fettered by sleep, to be butchered like cattle, I decline not thesame issue of my affairs at Ardea as I had at Rome."""Book 5,Chapter 45,"Both friends and enemies were satisfied that there existed no whereat that time a man of equal military talent. The assembly beingdismissed, they refresh themselves, carefully watching the moment thesignal should be given; which being given, during the silence of thebeginning of the night they attended Camillus at the gates. Having goneforth to no great distance from the city, they found the camp of theGauls, as had been foretold, unprotected and neglected on every side,and attack it with a shout. No fight any where, but slaughter everywhere; their bodies, naked and relaxed with sleep, are cut to pieces.Those most remote, however, being roused from their beds, not knowingwhat the tumult was, or whence it came, were directed to flight, andsome of them, without perceiving it, into the midst of the enemy. Agreat number flying into the territory of Antium, an attack being madeon them in their straggling march by the townspeople, were surroundedand cut off. A like carnage was made of the Tuscans in the Veientianterritory; who were so far from compassionating the city which had nowbeen its neighbour for nearly four hundred years, overpowered as it nowwas by a strange and unheard-of enemy, that at that very time they madeincursions on the Roman territory; and laden with plunder, had it incontemplation to lay siege to Veii, the bulwark and last hope of theRoman race. The Roman soldiers had seen them straggling over thecountry, and collected in a body, driving the spoil before them, andthey perceived their camp pitched at no great distance from Veii. Uponthis, first self-commiseration, then indignation, and after thatresentment, took possession of their minds: ""Were their calamities to bea subject of mockery to the Etrurians, from whom they had turned off theGallic war on themselves?"" Scarce could they curb their passions, so asto refrain from attacking them at the moment; and being restrained byQuintus C¾dicius, the centurion, whom they had appointed theircommander, they deferred the matter until night. A leader equal toCamillus was all that was wanted; in other respects matters wereconducted in the same order and with the same fortunate result. Andfurther, under the guidance of some prisoners, who had survived thenightly slaughter, they set out to Salin¾ against another body ofTuscans, they suddenly made on the following night still greater havoc,and returned to Veii exulting in their double victory."Book 5,Chapter 46,"Meanwhile, at Rome, the siege, in general, was slow, and there wasquiet on both sides, the Gauls being intent only on this, that none ofthe enemy should escape from between their posts; when, on a sudden, aRoman youth drew on himself the admiration both of his countrymen andthe enemy. There was a sacrifice solemnized at stated times by theFabian family on the Quirinal hill. To perform this Caius Fabius Dorsohaving descended from the Capitol, in the Gabine cincture, carrying inhis hands the sacred utensils, passed out through the midst of theenemy's post, without being at all moved by the calls or threats of anyof them, and reached the Quirinal hill; and after duly performing therethe solemn rites, coming back by the same way with the same firmcountenance and gait, confident that the gods were propitious, whoseworship he had not even neglected when prohibited by the fear of death,he returned to the Capitol to his friends, the Gauls being eitherastounded at such an extraordinary manifestation of boldness, or movedeven by religious considerations, of which the nation is by no meansregardless. In the mean time, not only the courage, but the strength ofthose at Veii increased daily, not only those Romans repairing thitherfrom the country who had strayed away after the unsuccessful battle, orthe disaster of the city being taken, but volunteers also flowing infrom Latium, to come in for share of the spoil. It now seemed high timethat their country should be recovered and rescued from the hands of theenemy. But a head was wanting to this strong body. The very spot putthem in mind of Camillus, and a considerable part consisted of soldierswho had fought successfully under his guidance and auspices: andC¾dicius declared that he would not give occasion that any one, whethergod or man, should terminate his command rather than that, mindful ofhis own rank, he would himself call (for the appointment of) a general.With universal consent it was resolved that Camillus should be sent forfrom Ardea, but not until the senate at Rome were first consulted: sofar did a sense of propriety regulate every proceeding, and so carefullydid they observe the distinctions of things in their almost desperatecircumstances. They had to pass at great risk through the enemy'sguards. For this purpose a spirited youth, Pontius Cominius, offered hisservices, and supporting himself on cork was carried down the Tiber tothe city. From thence, where the distance from the bank was shortest, hemakes his way into the Capitol over a portion of the rock that wascraggy, and therefore neglected by the enemy's guard: and beingconducted to the magistrates, he delivers the instructions received fromthe army. Then having received a decree of the senate, both thatCamillus should be recalled from exile at the comitia curiata, and beforthwith appointed dictator by order of the people, and that thesoldiers should have the general whom they wished, he passed out thesame way and proceeded with his despatches to Veii; and deputies beingsent to Camillus to Ardea, conducted him to Veii: or else the law waspassed by the curi¾, and he was nominated dictator in his absence; for Iam more inclined to believe that he did not set out from Ardea until hefound that the law was passed; because he could neither change hisresidence without an order of the people, nor hold the privilege of theauspices in the army until he was nominated dictator."Book 5,Chapter 47,"Whilst these things were going on at Veii, in the mean while thecitadel and Capitol of Rome were in great danger. For the Gauls eitherhaving perceived the track of a human foot where the messenger from Veiihad passed, or having of themselves remarked the easy ascent by the rockat the temple of Carmentis, on a moonlight night, after they had atfirst sent forward an unarmed person, to make trial of the way,delivering their arms, whenever any difficulty occurred, alternatelysupported and supporting each other, and drawing each other up,according as the ground required, they reached the summit in suchsilence, that they not only escaped the notice of the sentinels, but ofthe dogs also, an animal extremely wakeful with respect to noises bynight. The notice of the geese they did not escape, which, as beingsacred to Juno, were spared though they were in the greatest scarcity offood. Which circumstance was the cause of their preservation. For MarcusManlius, who three years before had been consul, a man distinguished inwar, being aroused from sleep by their cackling and the clapping oftheir wings, snatched up his arms, and at the same time calling theothers to do the same, proceeds to the spot; and whilst the others arethrown into confusion, he struck with the boss of his shield and tumblesdown a Gaul, who had already got footing on the summit; and when thefall of this man as he tumbled threw down those who were next him, heslew others, who in their consternation had thrown away their arms, andcaught hold of the rocks to which they clung. And now the others alsohaving assembled beat down the enemy by javelins and stones, and theentire band, having lost their footing, were hurled down the precipicein promiscuous ruin. The alarm then subsiding, the remainder of thenight was given up to repose, (as far as could be done considering thedisturbed state of their minds,) when the danger, even though past,still kept them in a state of anxiety. Day having appeared, the soldierswere summoned by sound of trumpet to attend the tribunes in assembly,when recompence was to be made both to merit and to demerit; Manlius wasfirst of all commended for his bravery and presented with gifts, notonly by the military tribunes, but with the consent of the soldiers, forthey all carried to his house, which was in the citadel, a contributionof half a pound of corn and half a pint of wine: a matter trifling inthe relation, but the [prevailing] scarcity had rendered it a strongproof of esteem, when each man, depriving himself of his own food,contributed in honour of one man a portion subtracted from his body andfrom his necessary requirements. Then the guards of that place where theenemy had climbed up unobserved, were summoned; and when QuintusSulpicius declared openly that he would punish all according to theusage of military discipline, being deterred by the consentient shout ofthe soldiers who threw the blame on one sentinel, he spared the rest.The man, who was manifestly guilty of the crime, he threw down from therock, with the approbation of all. From this time forth the guards onboth sides became more vigilant; on the part of the Gauls, because arumour spread that messengers passed between Veii and Rome, and on thatof the Romans, from the recollection of the danger which occurred duringthe night."Book 5,Chapter 48,"But beyond all the evils of siege and war, famine distressed botharmies; pestilence, moreover, [oppressed] the Gauls, both as beingencamped in a place lying between hills, as well as heated by theburning of the houses, and full of exhalations, and sending up not onlyashes but embers also, whenever the wind rose to any degree; and as thenation, accustomed to moisture and cold, is most intolerant of theseannoyances, and, suffering severely from the heat and suffocation, theywere dying, the diseases spreading as among cattle, now becoming wearyof burying separately, they heaped up the bodies promiscuously andburned them; and rendered the place remarkable by the name of Gallicpiles. A truce was now made with the Romans, and conferences were heldwith the permission of the commanders; in which when the Gaulsfrequently alluded to the famine, and referred to the urgency of that asa further motive for their surrendering, for the purpose of removingthat opinion, bread is said to have been thrown in many places from theCapitol, into the advanced posts of the enemy. But the famine couldneither be dissembled nor endured any longer. Accordingly, whilst thedictator is engaged in person in holding a levy, in ordering his masterof the horse, Lucius Valerius, to bring up the troops from Veii, inmaking preparations and arrangements, so that he may attack the enemy onequal terms, in the mean time the army of the Capitol, wearied out withkeeping guard and with watches, having surmounted all human sufferings,whilst nature would not suffer famine alone to be overcome, lookingforward from day to day, to see whether any succour would come from thedictator, at length not only food but hope also failing, and their armsweighing down their debilitated bodies, whilst the guards were beingrelieved, insisted that there should be either a surrender, or that theyshould be bought off, on whatever terms were possible, the Gaulsintimating in rather plain terms, that they could be induced for no verygreat compensation to relinquish the siege. Then the senate was held andinstructions were given to the military tribunes to capitulate. Uponthis the matter was settled between Quintus Sulpicius, a militarytribune, and Brennus, the chieftain of the Gauls, and one thousandpounds' weight of gold was agreed on as the ransom of a people, who weresoon after to be the rulers of the world. To a transaction veryhumiliating in itself, insult was added. False weights were brought bythe Gauls, and on the tribune objecting, his sword was thrown in inaddition to the weight by the insolent Gaul, and an expression was heardintolerable to the Romans, ""Woe to the vanquished!"""Book 5,Chapter 49," But both gods and men interfered to prevent the Romans from livingon the condition of being ransomed; for by some chance, before theexecrable price was completed, all the gold being not yet weighed inconsequence of the altercation, the dictator comes up, and orders thegold to be removed, and the Gauls to clear away. When they, holding outagainst him, affirmed that they had concluded a bargain, he denied thatthe agreement was a valid one, which had been entered into with amagistrate of inferior authority without his orders, after he had beennominated dictator; and he gives notice to the Gauls to get ready forbattle. He orders his men to throw their baggage in a heap, and to getready their arms, and to recover their country with steel, not withgold, having before their eyes the temples of the gods, and their wivesand children, and the soil of their country disfigured by the calamitiesof war, and all those objects which they were solemnly bound to defend,to recover, and to revenge. He then draws up his army, as the nature ofthe place admitted, on the site of the half-demolished city, and whichwas uneven by nature, and he secured all those advantages for his ownmen, which could be prepared or selected by military skill. The Gauls,thrown into confusion by the unexpected event, take up arms, and withrage, rather than good judgment, rushed upon the Romans. Fortune had nowchanged; now the aid of the gods and human prudence assisted the Romancause. At the first encounter, therefore, the Gauls were routed with nogreater difficulty than they had found in gaining the victory at Allia.They were afterwards beaten under the conduct and auspices of the sameCamillus, in a more regular engagement, at the eighth stone on theGabine road, whither they had betaken themselves after their defeat.There the slaughter was universal: their camp was taken, and not evenone person was left to carry news of the defeat. The dictator, afterhaving recovered his country from the enemy, returns into the city intriumph; and among the rough military jests which they throw out [onsuch occasions] he is styled, with praises by no means undeserved,Romulus, and parent of his country, and a second founder of the city.His country, thus preserved by arms, he unquestionably saved a secondtime in peace, when he hindered the people from removing to Veii, boththe tribunes pressing the matter with greater earnestness after theburning of the city, and the commons of themselves being more inclinedto that measure; and that was the cause of his not resigning hisdictatorship after the triumph, the senate entreating him not to leavethe commonwealth in so unsettled a state."Book 5,Chapter 50,"First of all, he proposed matters appertaining to the immortal gods;for he was a most scrupulous observer of religious duties; and heprocures a decree of the senate, ""that all the temples, as the enemy hadpossessed them, should be restored, their bounds traced, and expiationsmade for them, and that the form of expiation should be sought in thebooks by the decemvirs; that a league of hospitality should be enteredinto by public authority with the people of C¾re, because they hadafforded a reception to the sacred utensils of the Roman people and totheir priests; and because, by the kindness of that people, the worshipof the immortal gods had not been intermitted; that Capitoline gamesshould be exhibited, for that Jupiter, supremely good and great, hadprotected his own mansion and the citadel of the Roman people when indanger; and that Marcus Furius, the dictator, should establish a collegefor that purpose, out of those who should inhabit the Capitol andcitadel."" Mention was also introduced of expiating the voice heard bynight, which had been heard announcing the calamity before the Gallicwar, and neglected, and a temple was ordered in the New Street to AiusLocutius. The gold, which had been rescued from the Gauls, and that alsowhich during the alarm had been collected from the other temples intothe recess of Jupiter's temple, the recollection being confused as tothe temples to which it should be carried back, was all judged to besacred, and ordered to be placed under the throne of Jupiter. Alreadythe religious scruples of the state had appeared in this, that when goldwas wanting for public uses, to make up for the Gauls the amount of theransom agreed upon, they had accepted that which was contributed by thematrons, so that they might not touch the sacred gold. Thanks werereturned to the matrons, and to this was added the honour of theirhaving funeral orations pronounced on them after death, in the samemanner as the men. Those things being finished which appertained to thegods, and such measures as could be transacted through the senate, then,at length, as the tribunes were teasing the commons by their unceasingharangues, to leave the ruins, to remove to Veii, a city ready preparedfor them, being escorted by the entire senate, he ascends the tribunal,and spoke as follows:"Book 5,Chapter 51,"""Romans, so disagreeable to me are contentions with the tribunes ofthe people, that in my most melancholy exile, whilst I resided at Ardea,I had no other consolation than that I was removed from these contests;and for this same reason I would never have returned, even though yourecalled me by a decree of the senate, and by order of the people. Norhas it been any change in my own sentiments, but in your fortune, thathas persuaded me to return now. For the question was that my countryshould remain in its own established seat, not that I should reside inmy country. And on the present occasion I would gladly remain quiet andsilent, were not the present struggle also appertaining to my country'sinterests, to be wanting to which, as long as life lasts, were base inothers, in Camillus impious. For why have we recovered it? Why have werescued it when besieged out of the hands of the enemy, if we ourselvesdesert it when recovered? And when, the Gauls being victorious, theentire city captured, both the gods and the natives of Rome stillretained and inhabited the Capitol and citadel, shall even the citadeland the Capitol be deserted, now when the Romans are victorious and thecity has been recovered? And shall our prosperous fortune cause moredesolation to this city than our adverse caused? Truly if we had noreligious institutions established together with the city, and regularlytransmitted down to us, still the divine power has so manifestlyinterested itself in behalf of the Roman state on the present tryingoccasion, that I should think that all neglect of the divine worship wasremoved from the minds of men. For consider the events of these latteryears one after the other, whether prosperous or adverse; you will findthat all things succeeded favourably with us whilst we followed thegods, and unfavourably when we neglected them. Now, first of all theVeientian war--of how many years' duration, with what immense labourwaged!--was not brought to a termination, until the water was dischargedfrom the Alban lake by the admonition of the gods. What, in the name ofheaven, regarding this recent calamity of our city? did it arise, untilthe voice sent from heaven concerning the approach of the Gauls wastreated with slight? until the law of nations was violated by ourambassadors, and until such violation was passed over by us with thesame indifference towards the gods, when it should have been punished byus? Accordingly vanquished, made captives and ransomed, we have sufferedsuch punishments at the hands of gods and men, as that we are now awarning to the whole world. Afterwards our misfortunes reminded us ofour religious duties. We fled for refuge to the gods, to the seat ofJupiter supremely good and great; amid the ruin of all our effects oursacred utensils we partly concealed in the earth; part of them wecarried away to the neighbouring cities and removed from the eyes of theenemy. Though deserted by gods and men, still we intermitted not theworship of the gods. Accordingly they have restored to us our country,and victory, our ancient renown in war which had been lost, and on ourenemies, who, blinded by avarice, have violated the faith of a treatywith respect to the weight of gold, they have turned dismay, and flight,and slaughter."Book 5,Chapter 52,"""When you behold such striking instances of the effects of honouringor neglecting the deity, do you perceive what an act of impiety we areabout to perpetrate, scarcely emerging from the wreck of our formermisconduct and calamity? We possess a city founded under auspices andauguries; not a spot is there in it that is not full of religious ritesand of the gods: the days for the anniversary sacrifices are not moredefinitely stated, than are the places in which they are to beperformed. All these gods, both public and private, do ye, Romans,pretend to forsake. What similarity does your conduct bear [to that]which lately during the siege was beheld with no less admiration by theenemy than by yourselves in that excellent Caius Fabius, when hedescended from the citadel amid the Gallic weapons, and performed on theQuirinal hill the solemn rites of the Fabian family? Is it your wishthat the family religious rites should not be intermitted even duringwar, but that the public rites and the Roman gods should be desertedeven in time of peace, and that the pontiffs and flamens should be morenegligent of public religious ceremonies, than a private individual inthe anniversary rite of a particular family? Perhaps some one may say,that we will either perform these duties at Veii, or that we will sendour priests hither from thence in order to perform them; neither ofwhich can be done, without infringing on the established forms. For notto enumerate all the sacred rites severally and all the gods, whether inthe banquet of Jupiter can the lectisternium be performed in any otherplace, save in the Capitol? What shall I say of the eternal fire ofVesta, and of the statue, which, as the pledge of empire, is kept underthe safeguard of her temple? What, O Mars Gradivus, and you, fatherQuirinus, of your Ancilia? Is it right that these sacred things, coevalwith the city, some of them more ancient than the origin of the city,should be abandoned to profanation? And, observe the difference existingbetween us and our ancestors. They handed down to us certain sacredrites to be performed by us on the Alban and on the Lavinian mounts. Wasit in conformity with religion that these sacred rites were transferredto us to Rome from the cities of our enemies? shall we transfer themhence to Veii, an enemy's city, without impiety? Come, recollect howoften sacred rites are performed anew, because some ceremony of ourcountry had been omitted through negligence or accident. On a lateoccasion, what circumstance, after the prodigy of the Alban lake, proveda remedy to the state distressed by the Veientian war, but therepetition of the sacred rites and the renewal of the auspices? Butfurther, as if duly mindful of ancient religious usages, we have bothtransferred foreign deities to Rome, and have established new ones. Veryrecently, imperial Juno was transferred from Veii, and had herdedication performed on a day how distinguished for the extraordinaryzeal of the matrons, and with what a full attendance! We have directed atemple to be erected to Aius Locutius, in consequence of the heavenlyvoice heard in the New Street. To our other solemnities we have addedthe Capitoline games, and, by direction of the senate, we have founded anew college for that purpose. Which of these things need we have done,if we were to leave the Roman city together with the Gauls? if it wasnot voluntarily we remained in the Capitol for so many months of siege;if we were retained by the enemy through motives of fear? We arespeaking of the sacred rites and of the temples; what, pray, of thepriests? Does it not occur to you, what a degree of profaneness would becommitted in respect of them. The Vestals, forsooth, have but that onesettlement, from which nothing ever disturbed them, except the captureof the city. It is an act of impiety for the flamen Dialis to remain fora single night without the city. Do ye mean to make them Veientianinstead of Roman priests? And shall the virgins forsake thee, O Vesta?And shall the flamen by living abroad draw on himself and on his countrysuch a weight of guilt every night? What of the other things, all ofwhich we transact under auspices within the Pom¾rium, to what oblivion,to what neglect do we consign them? The assemblies of the Curias, whichcomprise military affairs; the assemblies of the Centuries, at which youelect consuls and military tribunes, when can they be held underauspices, unless where they are wont [to be held]? Shall we transferthem to Veii? or whether for the purpose of holding their electionsshall the people assemble at so great inconvenience into a city desertedby gods and men?"Book 5,Chapter 53,"""But the case itself forces us to leave a city desolated by fire andruin, and remove to Veii, where all things are entire, and not todistress the needy commons by building here. But that this is only heldout as a pretext, rather than that it is the real motive, I think isevident to you, though I should say nothing on the subject; for youremember that before the arrival of the Gauls, when the buildings, bothpublic and private, were still unhurt, and the city still stood insafety, this same question was agitated, that we should remove to Veii.Observe then, tribunes, what a difference there is between my way ofthinking and yours. Ye think that though it may not have been advisableto do it then, still that now it ought certainly to be done; I, on thecontrary, (and be not surprised until you shall have heard the state ofthe case,) admitting it were advisable to remove when the entire citywas safe, would not vote for relinquishing these ruins now. For thenvictory would be the cause of our removing into a captured city, onethat would be glorious to ourselves and our posterity; whilst now thissame removal would be wretched and disgraceful to us, and glorious tothe Gauls. For we shall appear not to have left our country asconquerors, but to have lost it from having been vanquished; the flightat Allia, the capture of the city, the blockading of the Capitol, [willseem] to have imposed this necessity on us of forsaking our householdgods, of having recourse to exile and flight from that place which wewere unable to defend. And have the Gauls been able to demolish Rome,which the Romans shall be deemed to have been unable to restore? Whatremains, but that if they should now come with new forces, (for it isevident that their number is scarcely credible,) and should they feeldisposed to dwell in this city, captured by them, and deserted by you,would you suffer them? What, if not the Gauls, but your old enemies, the®quans and Volscians, should form the design of removing to Rome; wouldyou be willing that they should become Romans, you Veientians? Would yeprefer that this should be a desert in your possession, or a city of theenemy? For my part I can see nothing more impious. Is it because ye areaverse to building, ye are prepared to incur this guilt, this disgrace?Even though no better, no more ample structure could be erectedthroughout the entire city than that cottage of our founder, is it notbetter to dwell in cottages, like shepherds and rustics, amid yoursacred places and your household gods, than to go publicly into exile?Our forefathers, strangers and shepherds, when there was nothing inthese places but woods and marshes, erected a new city in a very shorttime; do we, with a Capitol and citadel safe, and the temples of thegods still standing, feel it irksome to build up what has been burnt?and what we individually would have done, if our private residence hadbeen burned down, shall we as a body refuse to do in the case of apublic conflagration?"Book 5,Chapter 54,"""What, if by some evil design of accident a fire should break out atVeii, and the flames spread by the wind, as may happen, should consume aconsiderable portion of the city; are we then to seek Fiden¾, or Gabii,or any other city to remove to? Has our native soil so slight a hold onus, or this earth which we call mother; or does our love of country liemerely in the surface and in the timber of the houses? For my part, Iwill acknowledge to you, whilst I was absent, though I am less disposedto remember this as the effect of your injustice than of my ownmisfortune, as often as my country came into my mind, all thesecircumstances occurred to me, the hills, the plains, the Tiber, the faceof the country familiar to my eyes, and this sky, beneath which I hadbeen born and educated; may these now induce you, by their endearinghold on you, to remain in your present settlement, rather than theyshould cause you to pine away through regret, after having left them.Not without good reason did gods and men select this place for foundinga city: these most healthful hills; a commodious river, by means ofwhich the produce of the soil may be conveyed from the inland countries,by which maritime supplies may be obtained; close enough to the sea forall purposes of convenience, and not exposed by too much proximity tothe dangers of foreign fleets; a situation in the centre of the regionsof Italy, singularly adapted by nature for the increase of a city. Thevery size of so new a city is a proof. Romans, the present year is thethree hundred and sixty-fifth year of the city; for so long a time areyou waging war amid nations of such long standing; yet not to mentionsingle cities, neither the Volscians combined with the ®quans, so manyand such strong towns, nor all Etruria, so potent by land and sea,occupying the breadth of Italy between the two seas, can cope with youin war. And as the case is so, where, in the name of goodness, is thewisdom in you who have tried [this situation] to make trial now of someother, when, though your own valour may be removed elsewhere, thefortune of this place certainly cannot be transferred? Here is theCapitol, where, a human head being found, it was foretold that in thatplace would be the head of the world, and the chief seat of empire.Here, when the Capitol was to be freed by the rites of augury, Juventasand Terminus, to the very great joy of our fathers, suffered notthemselves to be moved. Here is the fire of Vesta, here the Ancilia sentdown from heaven, here are all the gods propitious to you if you stay."""Book 5,Chapter 55,"Camillus is said to have moved them as well by other parts of hisspeech, but chiefly by that which related to religious matters. But anexpression seasonably uttered determined the matter whilst stillundecided; for when a meeting of the senate, a little after this, wasbeing held in the Curia Hostilia regarding these questions, and sometroops returning from relieving guard passed through the forum in theirmarch, a centurion in the comitium cried out, ""Standard-bearer, fix yourstandard! it is best for us to remain here."" Which expression beingheard, both the senate came out from the senate-house, and all cried outthat ""they embraced the omen,"" and the commons, who were collectedaround, joined their approbation. The law [under discussion] beingrejected, the building of the city commenced in several parts at once.Tiles were supplied at the public expense. The privilege of hewing stoneand felling timber wherever each person wished was granted, securitybeing taken that they would finish the buildings on that year. Theirhaste took away all attention to the regulating the course of thestreets, whilst, setting aside all distinction of property, they buildon any part that was vacant. That is the reason why the ancient sewers,at first conducted through the public streets, now in many places passunder private houses, and why the form of the city appears more like onetaken up by individuals, than regularly portioned out [bycommissioners]."Book 6,Chapter 1,"The transactions of the Romans, from the building of the city of Rometo the capture of the same city, first under kings, then under consuls,and dictators, and decemvirs, and consular tribunes, their wars abroad,their dissensions at home, I have exhibited in five books: mattersobscure, as well by reason of their very great antiquity, like objectswhich from their great distance are scarcely perceptible, as alsobecause in those times the use of letters, the only faithful guardian ofthe memory of events, was inconsiderable and rare: and, moreover,whatever was contained in the commentaries of the pontiffs, and otherpublic and private records, were lost for the most part in the burningof the city. Henceforwards, from the second origin of the city, whichsprung up again more healthfully and vigorously, as if from its root,its achievements at home and abroad, shall be narrated with moreclearness and authenticity. But it now stood erect, leaning chiefly onthe same support, Marcus Furius, by which it had been first raised; nordid they suffer him to lay down the dictatorship until the end of theyear. It was not agreeable to them, that the tribunes during whose timeof office the city had been taken, should preside at the elections forthe following year: the administration came to an interregnum. Whilstthe state was kept occupied in the employment and constant labour ofrepairing the city, in the mean time a day of trial was named by CaiusMarcius, tribune of the people, for Quintus Fabius, as soon as he wentout of office, because whilst an ambassador he had, contrary to the lawof nations, appeared in arms against the Gauls, to whom he had been sentas a negotiator; from which trial death removed him so opportunely thatmost people thought it voluntary. The interregnum commenced. PubliusCornelius Scipio was interrex, and after him Marcus Furius Camillus. Henominates as military tribunes with consular power, Lucius ValeriusPublicola a second time, Lucius Virginius, Publius Cornelius, AulusManlius, Lucius ®milius, Lucius Postumius. These having entered on theiroffice immediately after the interregnum, consulted the senate on noother business previous to that which related to religion. In the firstplace they ordered that the treaties and laws which could be found,should be collected; (these consisted of the twelve tables, and somelaws made under the kings.) Some of them were publicly promulgated; butsuch as appertained to religious matters were kept secret chiefly by thepontiffs, that they might hold the minds of the people fettered by them.Then they began to turn their attention to the subject of desecrateddays; and the day before the fifteenth day of the calends of August,remarkable for a double disaster, (as being the day on which the Fabiiwere slain at Cremera, and afterwards the disgraceful battle attendedwith the ruin of the city had been fought at Allia,) they called theAllian day from the latter disaster, and they rendered it remarkable fortransacting no business whether public or private. Some persons think,that because Sulpicius, the military tribune, had not duly offeredsacrifice on the day after the ides of July, and because, without havingobtained the favour of the gods, the Roman army had been exposed to theenemy on the third day after, an order was also made to abstain from allreligious undertakings on the day following the ides: thence the samereligious observance was derived with respect to the days following thecalends and the nones."Book 6,Chapter 2,"But it was not long allowed them to consult in quiet regarding themeans of raising the city, after so grievous a fall. On the one sidetheir old enemies, the Volscians, had taken arms, to extinguish theRoman name: on the other, some traders brought [intelligence] that aconspiracy of the leading men of Etruria from all the states had beenformed at the temple of Voltumna. A new cause of terror also had beenadded by the defection of the Latins and Hernicians, who, since thebattle fought at the lake Regillus, had remained in friendship with theRoman people with fidelity not to be questioned. Accordingly, when suchgreat alarms surrounded them on every side, and it became apparent toall that the Roman name laboured not only under hatred with theirenemies, but under contempt also with their allies; it was resolved thatthe state should be defended under the same auspices, as those underwhich it had been recovered, and that Marcus Furius should be nominateddictator. He, when dictator, nominated Caius Servilius Ahala master ofthe horse; and a suspension of all public business being proclaimed, heheld a levy of the juniors, in such a manner as to divide them intocenturies after they had sworn allegiance to him. The army, when raisedand equipped with arms, he divided into three parts. One part he opposedto Etruria in the Veientian territory; another he ordered to pitch theircamp before the city. A military tribune, Aulus Manlius, commanded thelatter; those who were sent against the Etrurians, Lucius ®miliuscommanded. The third part he led in person against the Volscians; andnot far from Lanuvium, (the place is called ad M¾cium,) he set aboutstorming their camp. Into these, who set out to the war from motives ofcontempt, because they thought that all the Roman youth were cut off bythe Gauls, the fact of having heard that Camillus was appointed to thecommand struck such terror, that they fenced themselves with a rampart,and the rampart itself with trees piled up together, lest the enemymight by any means reach to the works. When Camillus observed this, heordered fire to be thrown into the fence opposed to him; and it sohappened that a very strong wind was turned towards the enemy. Hetherefore not only opened a passage by the fire, but the flames beingdirected against the camp, by the vapour also and the smoke, and by thecrackling of the green timber as it burned, he so confounded the enemythat the Romans had less difficulty in passing the rampart into thecamp of the Volscians, than they had experienced in climbing over thefence which had been consumed by the fire. The enemy being routed andcut down, after the dictator had taken the camp by assault, he gave upthe booty to the soldiers, which was so much the more agreeable, as itwas less expected, the commander being by no means profusely generous.Then having pursued them in their flight, after he had depopulated theentire Volscian land, he at length in the seventieth year forced theVolscians to a surrender. After his victory he passed from the Volsciansto the ®quans, who were also preparing for hostilities: he surprisedtheir army at Bol¾, and having attacked not only their camp, but theircity also, he took them at the first onset."Book 6,Chapter 3,"When such fortune manifested itself on that side where Camillus, thelife and soul of the Roman interest, was, a great alarm had fallen onanother quarter. For almost all Etruria, taking up arms, were besiegingSutrium, allies of the Roman people, whose ambassadors having applied tothe senate, imploring aid in their distress, obtained a decree, that thedictator should at the earliest opportunity bear aid to the Sutrians.And when the circumstances of the besieged would not suffer them tobrook the delay of this hope, and the small number of the townsmen werespent with labour, watching, and wounds, all which fell heavily on thesame individuals, and when, the city being delivered up to the enemy bya capitulation, they were leaving their habitations in a miserabletrain, being discharged without their arms with only a single garment;at that juncture Camillus happened to come up at the head of the Romanarmy. And when the mournful crowd prostrated themselves at his feet, andthe address of the leading men, wrung from them by extreme necessity,was followed by the weeping of women and boys, who were dragged along bythe companions of their exile, he bade the Sutrians to give over theirlamentations: that he brought with him grief and tears to the Etrurians.He then orders the baggage to be deposited, and the Sutrians to remainthere with a small guard left with them, and the soldiers to follow himin arms. Having thus proceeded to Sutrium with his army disencumbered,he found, as he expected, every thing in disorder, as usually happens insuccess; no advanced guard before the walls, the gates lying open, andthe conquerors dispersed, carrying out the booty from the houses of theenemy. Sutrium is therefore taken a second time on the same day; theEtrurians, lately victorious, are cut down in every quarter by their newenemy, nor is time afforded them to collect and form one body, or evento take up arms. When each pushed eagerly towards the gates, to try ifby any chance they could throw themselves into the fields, they foundthe gates shut; for the dictator had given those orders in the firstinstance. Upon this some took up arms, others, who happened to be armedbefore the tumult came on them, called their friends together in orderto make battle; which would have been kindled by the despair of theenemy, had not criers, sent in every direction through the city, issuedorders that their arms should be laid down, that the unarmed should bespared, and that no one should be injured except those who were armed.Then even those whose minds had been, in their last hope, obstinatelybent on fighting, when hopes of life were offered, threw down their armsin every direction, and surrendered themselves unarmed to the enemy,which fortune had rendered the safer method. Their number beingconsiderable, they were distributed among several guards; the town wasbefore night restored to the Sutrians uninjured and free from all thecalamities of war, because it had not been taken by force but deliveredup on terms."Book 6,Chapter 4,"Camillus returned to the city in triumph, being victorious in threewars at the same time. By far the greatest number of the prisoners whomhe led before his chariot were from among the Etrurians. And these beingsold by auction, such a sum of money was raised, that after paying thematrons the price of their gold, out of that which was over and above,three golden bowls were made; which, inscribed with the name ofCamillus, it is certain, lay, before the burning of the Capitol, in therecess of Jupiter's temple at the feet of Juno. On that year such of theVeientians, Capenatians, and Faliscians as had come over to the Romansduring the wars with those nations, were admitted into the state, andland was assigned to these new citizens. Those also were recalled by adecree of the senate from Veii, who, from a dislike to building at Rome,had betaken themselves to Veii, and had seized on the vacant housesthere. And at first there was a murmuring on their part disregarding theorder; then a day having been appointed, and capital punishment[denounced against any one] who did not return to Rome, from beingrefractory as they were collectively, rendered them when taken singlyobedient, each through fear for himself. And Rome both now increased innumbers, and rose throughout its entire extent by its buildings, thestate assisting in the expenses, and the ¾diles urging on the work as ifpublic, and private persons (for the want felt of accommodationstimulated them) hastening to complete the work; and within a year a newcity was erected. At the termination of the year an election was held ofmilitary tribunes with consular power. Those elected were, TitusQuinctius Cincinnatus, Quintus Servilius Fidenas a fifth time, LuciusJulius Iulus, Lucius Aquillius Corvus, Lucius Lucretius Tricipitinus,Servius Sulpicius Rufus. They led one army against the ®quans, not towar, (for they owned themselves conquered,) but from motives ofanimosity, to lay waste their territories, lest they should leave themany strength for new designs; the other into the territory of Tarquinii.Here Cortuosa and Contenebra, towns belonging to the Etrurians, weretaken by storm and demolished. At Cortuosa there was no contest; havingattacked it by surprise, they took it at the first shout and onset; thetown was plundered and burned. Contenebra sustained a siege for a fewdays; and it was continual labour, abated neither by night nor by day,that reduced them. When the Roman army, having been divided into sixparts, each [division] relieved the other in the battle one hour in sixin rotation, and the paucity of numbers exposed the same individualtownsmen, wearied as they were, to a contest ever new, they at lengthyielded, and an opportunity was afforded to the Romans of entering thecity. It was the wish of the tribunes that the spoil should be madepublic property; but the order [that such should be so] was too late fortheir determination. Whilst they hesitate, the spoil already became theproperty of the soldiers; nor could it be taken from them, except bymeans calculated to excite dissatisfaction. On the same year, that thecity should not increase by private buildings only, the lower parts ofthe Capitol also were built of hewn stone; a work deserving ofadmiration even amid the present magnificence of the city."Book 6,Chapter 5,"Now, whilst the state was busily occupied in building, the tribunesof the commons endeavoured to draw crowds to their harangues by[proposing] the agrarian laws. The Pomptine territory was then, for thefirst time since the power of the Volscians had been reduced byCamillus, held out to them as their indisputable right. They alleged itas a charge, that ""that district was much more harassed on the part ofthe nobility than it had been on that of the Volscians, for thatincursions were made by the one party on it, only as long as they hadstrength and arms; that persons belonging to the nobility encroached onthe possession of land that was public, nor would there be any room init for the commons, unless a division were now made, before they seizedon all."" They made not much impression on the commons, who through theiranxiety for building attended the forum only in small numbers, and weredrained by their expenses on the same object, and were thereforecareless about land for the improvement of which means were wanting. Thestate being full of religious impressions, and then even the leading menhaving become superstitious by reason of their recent misfortunes, inorder that the auspices might be taken anew, the government had oncemore recourse to an interregnum. The successive interreges were, MarcusManlius Capitolinus, Servius Sulpicius Camerinus, and Lucius ValeriusPotitus. The last at length held an election of military tribunes withconsular power. He nominates Lucius Papirius, Caius Cornelius, CaiusSergius, Lucius ®milius a second time, Lucius Menenius, and LuciusValerius Publicola a third time. These entered on their office after theinterregnum. This year the temple of Mars, vowed in the Gallic war, wasdedicated by Titus Quinctius, duumvir for performing religious rites.Four tribes were added from the new citizens, the Stellatine, theTormentine, the Sabatine, and the Arnian, and they made up the number oftwenty-five tribes."Book 6,Chapter 6,"Regarding the Pomptine land the matter was pressed by LuciusSicinius, plebeian tribune, on the people, who now attended in greaternumbers, and more readily aroused to the desire of land than they hadbeen. And mention having been introduced in the senate regarding waragainst the Latins and Hernicians, the matter was deferred inconsequence of their attending to a more important war, because Etruriawas up in arms. Matters reverted to their electing Camillus militarytribune with consular power. Five colleagues were added, ServiusCornelius Maluginensis, Quintus Servilius Fidenas a sixth time, LuciusQuinctius Cincinnatus, Lucius Horatius Pulvillus, and Publius Valerius.At the commencement of the year the attention of the people was drawnaway from the Etrurian war, because a body of fugitives from thePomptine district, suddenly entering the city, brought word that theAntians were up in arms; and that the states of the Latins privatelysent their youth to that war, denying that there was any public concertin it, they alleging that volunteers were only not prevented fromserving in whatever quarter they pleased. They had now ceased to despiseany wars. Accordingly the senate returned thanks to the gods, becauseCamillus was in office; for (they knew) that it would have beennecessary to nominate him dictator, if he were in a private station. Andhis colleagues agreed that when any terror with respect to warthreatened, the supreme direction of every thing should be vested in oneman, and that they had determined to consign their authority into thehands of Camillus; and that they did not consider, that any concessionthey should make to the dignity of that man, derogated in any way fromtheir own. The tribunes having been highly commended by the senate,Camillus himself also, covered with confusion, returned thanks. He thensaid that ""a heavy burden was laid on him by the Roman people, by theirhaving now nominated him dictator for the fourth time; a great one bythe senate, by reason of such flattering judgments of that houseconcerning him; the greatest of all, however, by the condescension ofsuch distinguished colleagues. Where if any addition could be made tohis diligence and vigilance, that, vying with himself, he would striveto render the opinion of the state, [expressed] with such unanimityregarding him, as permanent as it was most honourable."" In reference tothe war and to the people of Antium, that there was more of threatsthere than of danger; that he, however, would advise that, as theyshould fear nothing, so should they despise nothing. That the city ofRome was beset by the ill-will and hatred of its neighbours: thereforethat the commonwealth should be maintained by a plurality, both ofgenerals and of armies. ""It is my wish,"" said he, ""that you, PubliusValerius, as my associate in command and counsel, should lead the troopswith me against the enemy at Antium; that you, Quintus Servilius, afterraising and equipping another army, shall encamp in the city, ready toact, whether Etruria, as lately, or these new causes of anxiety, theLatins and Hernicians, should bestir themselves. I deem it as certainthat you will conduct matters, as is worthy of your father andgrandfather, and of yourself and six tribuneships. Let a third army beraised by Lucius Quinctius, out of those excused from service and theseniors, [those past the military age,] who may protect the city and thewalls. Let Lucius Horatius provide arms, weapons, corn, and whatever theother exigencies of the war shall demand. You, Servius Cornelius, weyour colleagues appoint the president of this council of the state, theguardian of religion, of the assemblies, of the laws, and of all matterspertaining to the city."" All cheerfully promising their utmostendeavours in the discharge of their apportioned offices, Valerius,chosen as his associate in command, added, ""that Marcus Furius should beconsidered by him as dictator, and that he would act as master of thehorse to him. Wherefore, that they should entertain hopes regarding thewar, proportioned to the opinion they formed of their sole commander.""The senate, elated with joy, cry out, that ""they entertained good hopes,both regarding war, and peace, and the republic in general; and that therepublic would never have need of a dictator, if it were to have suchmen in office, united together in such harmony of sentiments, preparedalike to obey and to command, and who were laying up praise as commonstock, rather than taking it from the common fund to themselvesindividually."""Book 6,Chapter 7,"A suspension of civil business being proclaimed, and a levy beingheld, Furius and Valerius set out to Satricum; to which place theAntians had drawn together not only the youth of the Volscians, selectedout of the new generation, but immense numbers of the Latins andHernicians, out of states which by a long [enjoyment of] peace were inthe most unimpaired condition. The new enemy then added to the old shookthe spirits of the Roman soldiers. When the centurions reported this toCamillus, whilst forming his line of battle, that ""the minds of thesoldiers were disturbed, that arms were taken up by them withbackwardness, and that they left the camp with hesitation andreluctance; nay, that some expressions were heard, that they should eachhave to fight with one hundred enemies, and that such numbers, even ifunarmed, much less when furnished with arms, could with difficulty bewithstood,"" he leaped on his horse, and in front of the troops, turningto the line, and riding between the ranks, ""What dejection of mind isthis, soldiers, what backwardness? Is it with the enemy, or me, oryourselves you are unacquainted? What else are the enemy, but theconstant subject of your bravery and your glory? on the other hand, withme as your general, to say nothing of the taking of Falerii and Veii,you have lately celebrated a triple triumph for a three-fold victoryover these self-same Volscians and ®quans, and Etruria. Do you notrecognise me as your general, because I gave you the signal, not asdictator, but as tribune? I neither feel the want of the highestauthority over you, and you should look to nothing in me but myself; forthe dictatorship neither added to my courage, any more than exile tookit from me. We are all therefore the same individuals; and as we bringto this war the same requisites as we brought to former wars, let uslook for the same result of the war. As soon as you commence the fight,each will do that which he has learned and been accustomed to do. Youwill conquer, they will run."""Book 6,Chapter 8,"Then having given the signal, he leaps from his horse, and seizingthe standard-bearer who was next him by the hand, he hurries him on withhim against the enemy, calling aloud, ""Soldiers, advance the standard.""And when they saw Camillus himself, now disabled through age for bodilyexertion, advancing against the enemy, they all rush forwards together,having raised a shout, each eagerly crying out, ""Follow the general.""They say further that the standard was thrown into the enemy's line byorder of Camillus, and that the van was then exerted to recover it. Thatthere first the Antians were forced to give way, and that the panicspread not only to the first line, but to the reserve troops also. Norwas it merely the ardour of the soldiers animated by the presence oftheir general that made this impression, but because nothing was moreterrible to the minds of the Volscians, than the sight of Camillus whichhappened to present itself. Thus, in whatever direction he went, hecarried certain victory with him. This was particularly evident, when,hastily mounting his horse, he rode with a footman's shield to the leftwing, which was almost giving way, by the fact of showing himself herestored the battle, pointing out the rest of the line gaining thevictory. Now the result was decided, but the flight of the enemy wasimpeded by their great numbers, and the wearied soldiers would have hadtedious work in putting so great a number to the sword, when rainsuddenly falling with a violent storm, put an end to the pursuit of thevictory which was now decided, rather than to the battle. Then thesignal for retreat being given, the fall of night put an end to the war,without further trouble to the Romans. For the Latins and Hernicians,having abandoned the Volscians, marched to their homes, having attainedresults corresponding to their wicked measures. The Volscians, when theysaw themselves deserted by those through reliance on whom they hadresumed hostilities, abandoned their camp, and shut themselves up withinthe walls of Satricum. Camillus at first prepared to surround them bylines of circumvallation, and to prosecute the siege by a mound andother works. But seeing that this was obstructed by no sally from thetown, and considering that the enemy possessed too little spirit for himto wait in tedious expectation of victory under the circumstances, afterexhorting his soldiers not to waste themselves by tedious labours, as[they had done] when besieging Veii, that the victory was in theirhands, he attacked the walls on every side, amid the great alacrity ofthe soldiers, and took the town by scalade. The Volscians, having throwndown their arms, surrendered themselves."Book 6,Chapter 9,"But the general's thoughts were fixed on a higher object, on Antium:[he knew] that that was the great aim of the Volscians, and main sourceof the late war. But because so strong a city could not be taken withoutgreat preparations, engines and machines, leaving his colleague with thearmy, he set out for Rome, in order to advise the senate to have Antiumdestroyed. In the middle of his discourse, (I suppose that it was thewish of the gods that the state of Antium should last a longer time,)ambassadors came from Nepete and Sutrium, soliciting aid against theEtrurians, urging that the time for giving them aid would soon pass by.Thither did fortune avert the force of Camillus from Antium; for asthose places were situate opposite Etruria, and were barriers or gatesas it were on that side, both they had a wish to get possession of them,whenever they meditated any new enterprise, and the Romans to recoverand secure them. Wherefore the senate resolved to treat with Camillus,that he would relinquish Antium and undertake the Etrurian war. The citytroops, which Quinctius had commanded, are decreed to him. Though hewould have preferred the army which was in the Volscian territory, asbeing tried and accustomed to him, he made no objection: he onlydemanded Valerius as his associate in command. Quinctius and Horatiuswere sent against the Volscians, as successors to Valerius. Furius andValerius, having set out from the city to Sutrium, found one part of thetown already taken by the Etrurians, and on the other part, theapproaches to which were barricaded, the townsmen with difficultyrepelling the assault of the enemy. Both the approach of aid from Rome,as also the name of Camillus, universally respected both with the enemyand the allies, sustained their tottering state for the present, andafforded time for bringing them relief. Accordingly Camillus, havingdivided his army, orders his colleague to lead round his troops to thatside which the enemy already possessed, and to assault the walls; not somuch from any hope that the city could be taken by scalade, as that, byturning away the enemy's attention to that quarter, both the townsmenwho were wearied with fighting might have some relaxation of their toil,and that he himself might have an opportunity of entering the citywithout a contest. This having been done on both sides, and the doubleterror now surrounding the Etrurians, when they saw that the walls wereassailed with the utmost fury, and that the enemy were within the walls,they threw themselves out in consternation, in one body, by a gate whichalone happened not to be guarded. Great slaughter was made on them asthey fled, both in the city and through the fields. The greater numberwere slain within the walls by Furius' soldiers: those of Valerius weremore alert for the pursuit; nor did they put an end to the slaughteruntil night, which prevented them from seeing. Sutrium being recoveredand restored to the allies, the army was led to Nepete, which havingbeen received by capitulation, was now entirely in the possession of theEtrurians."Book 6,Chapter 10,"It appeared probable, that there would be more of labour inrecovering the city, not only for this reason, because it was all inpossession of the enemy, but also because the surrender had been made inconsequence of a party of the Nepesinians having betrayed the state. Itwas determined, however, that a message should be sent to their leadingmen, to separate themselves from the Etrurians, and that they themselvesshould evince that strict fidelity, which they had implored from theRomans. Whence as soon as an answer was brought that there was nothingin their power, that the Etrurians occupied the walls and the guards ofthe gates, first, terror was struck into the townsmen by laying wastetheir land; then, when the faith of the capitulation was morereligiously observed than that of the alliance, the army was led up tothe walls with fascines of bushes collected from the fields, and theditches being filled, the scaling ladders were raised, and the town wastaken at the first shout and attack. Proclamation was then made to theNepesinians, that they should lay down their arms, and orders were giventhat the unarmed should be spared. The Etrurians, armed and unarmed,were put to the sword without distinction: of the Nepesinians also theauthors of the surrender were beheaded. To the unoffending multitudetheir property was restored, and the town was left with a garrison. Thushaving recovered two allied cities from the enemy, the tribunes marchedback their victorious army to Rome. During the same year restitution wasdemanded from the Latins and Hernicians, and the cause was asked whythey had not during some years supplied soldiers according tostipulation. An answer was given in a full assembly of both nations,""that neither the blame was public, nor was there any design in thecircumstance of some of their youth having served among the Volscians.That these individuals, however, suffered the penalty of their improperconduct, and that none of them had returned. But that the cause of theirnot supplying the soldiers had been their continual terror from theVolscians, which pest adhering to their side, had not been capable ofbeing destroyed by so many successive wars."" Which answer being reportedto the senate, they decided that there was wanting rather a seasonabletime for declaring war than sufficient grounds for it."Book 6,Chapter 11,"In the following year, Aulus Manlius, Publius Cornelius, Titus andLucius Quintii Capitolini, Lucius Papirius Cursor a second time, CaiusSergius a second time, being military tribunes with consular power, agrievous war broke out abroad, a still more grievous disturbance athome; the war originated on the part of the Volscians, to which wasadded a revolt of the Latins and Hernicians; the sedition from one fromwhom it could be least of all apprehended, a man of patrician birth anddistinguished character, Marcus Manlius Capitolinus; who being tooaspiring in mind, whilst he despised the other leading men, envied one,who was peculiarly distinguished both by honours and by merit, MarcusFurius: he became indignant that he should be the only man among themagistrates; the only man at the head of the armies; that he nowattained such eminence that he treated not as colleagues but as meretools the persons elected under the same auspices; though, in the meantime, if any one would form a just estimate, his country could not havebeen recovered by Marcus Furius from the siege of the enemy, had not theCapitol and citadel been first preserved by him; and the other attackedthe Gauls, whilst their attention was distracted between receiving thegold and the hope of peace, when he himself drove them off when armedand taking the citadel; of the other's glory, a man's share appertainedto all the soldiers who conquered along with him; that in his victory noman living was a sharer. His mind puffed by these notions, and moreover,from a viciousness of disposition being vehement and headstrong, when heperceived that his influence among the patricians did not stand forth asprominent as he thought it should, he, the first of all the patricians,became a plebeian partisan, and formed plans in conjunction with theplebeian magistrates; and by criminating the fathers, and alluring thecommons to his side, he now came to be carried along by the tide ofpopular applause, not by prudence, and preferred to be of a great,rather than of a good character: and not content with agrarian laws,which had ever served the tribunes of the commons as material fordisturbances, he now began to undermine public credit; for [he wellknew] ""that the incentives of debt were sharper, as not only threateningpoverty and ignominy, but intimidated personal liberty with stocks andchains."" And the amount of the debt was immense, contracted by building,a circumstance most destructive even to the rich. The Volscian wartherefore, heavy in itself, charged with additional weight by thedefection of the Latins and Hernicians, was held out as a colourablepretext, for having a higher authority resorted to. But it was ratherthe reforming plans that drove the senate to create a dictator. AulusCornelius Cossus having been elected dictator, nominated Titus QuinctiusCapitolinus his master of the horse."Book 6,Chapter 12,"The dictator, though he perceived that a greater struggle wasreserved for him at home than abroad; still, either because there wasneed of despatch for the war, or supposing that by a victory and atriumph he should add to the powers of the dictatorship itself, held alevee and proceeds into the Pomptine territory, where he had heard thatthe Volscians had appointed their army to assemble. I doubt not butthat, in addition to satiety, to persons reading of so many wars wagedwith the Volscians, this same circumstance will suggest itself, whichoften served as an occasion of surprise to me when perusing the writerswho lived nearer to the times of these occurrences, from what source theVolscians and ®quans, so often vanquished, could have procured suppliesof soldiers. And as this has been unnoticed and passed over in silenceby ancient writers; on which matter what can I state, except mereopinion, which every one may from his own conjecture form for himself?It seems probable, either that they employed, as is now practised in theRoman levies, successive generations of their young men one after theother, during the intervals between the wars; or that the armies werenot always recruited out of the same states, though the same nation mayhave made war; or that there was an innumerable multitude of free-men inthose places, which, at the present day, Roman slaves save from being adesert, a scanty seminary of soldiers being scarcely left. Certain itis, (as is agreed upon among all authors,) although their power was verymuch impaired under the guidance and auspices of Camillus, the forces ofthe Volscians were strong: besides, the Latins and Hernicians had beenadded, and some of the Circeians, and some Roman colonists also fromVelitr¾. The dictator, having pitched his camp on that day, and oncoming forth on the day following after taking the auspices, and having,by sacrificing a victim, implored the favour of the gods, with joyfulcountenance presented himself to the soldiers, who were now taking armsat day-break, according to orders, on the signal for battle beingdisplayed. ""Soldiers,"" says he, ""the victory is ours, if the gods andtheir prophets see aught into futurity. Accordingly, as it becomes menfull of well-grounded hope, and who are about to engage with theirinferiors, let us place our spears at our feet, and arm our right handsonly with our swords. I would not even wish that any should push forwardbeyond the line; but that, standing firm, you receive the enemy's chargein a steady posture. When they shall have discharged their ineffectivemissives, and, breaking their ranks, they shall rush on you as you standfirm, then let your swords glitter, and let each man recollect, thatthere are gods who aid the Roman; those gods, who have sent us intobattle with favourable omens. Do you, Titus Quinctius, keep back thecavalry, attentively observing the very commencement of the contest; assoon as you observe the armies closed foot to foot, then, whilst theyare taken up with another panic, strike terror into them with yourcavalry, and by making a charge on them, disperse the ranks of thoseengaged in the fight."" The cavalry, the infantry conduct the fight, justas he had ordered them. Nor did either the general disappoint thelegions, nor fortune the general."Book 6,Chapter 13,"The army of the enemy, relying on nothing but on their number, andmeasuring both armies merely by the eye, entered on the battleinconsiderately, and inconsiderately gave it over: fierce only in theirshout and with their missive weapons, and at the first onset of thefight, they were unable to withstand the swords, and the closeengagement foot to foot, and the looks of the enemy, darting firethrough their ardour for the fight. Their front line was driven in, andconfusion spread to the reserve troops, and the cavalry occasioned alarmon their part: the ranks were then broken in many places, every thingwas set in motion, and the line seemed as it were fluctuating. Thenwhen, the foremost having fallen, each saw that death was about to reachhimself, they turn their backs. The Roman followed close on them; and aslong as they went off armed and in bodies, the labour in the pursuitfell to the infantry; when it was observed that their arms were thrownaway in every direction, and that the enemy's line was scattered inflight through the country; then squadrons of horse were sent out,intimation being given that they should not, by losing time with themassacre of individuals, afford an opportunity in the mean time to themultitude to escape: it would be sufficient that their speed should beretarded by missive weapons and by terror, and that the progress oftheir forces should be detained by skirmishing, until the infantryshould be able to overtake and despatch the enemy by regular slaughter.There was no end of the flight and slaughter before night; on the sameday the camp of the Volscians was taken also and pillaged, and all theplunder, save the persons of free condition, was given up to thesoldiers. The greatest part of the prisoners consisted of Latins andHernicians, and these not men of plebeian rank, so that it could besupposed that they had served for hire, but some young men of rank werefound among them: an evident proof that the Volscian enemies had beenaided by public authority. Some of the Circeians also were recognised,and colonists from Velitr¾; and being all sent to Rome, on beinginterrogated by the leading senators, plainly revealed the samecircumstances as they had done to the dictator, the defection each ofhis respective state."Book 6,Chapter 14,"The dictator kept his army in the standing camp, not at all doubtingthat the senate would order war with these states; when a more momentousdifficulty having occurred at home, rendered it necessary that he shouldbe sent for to Rome, the sedition gaining strength every day, which thefomenter was now rendering more than ordinarily formidable. For now itwas easy to see from what motives proceeded not only the discourses ofManlius, but his actions also, apparently suggested by popular zeal, butat the same time tending to create disturbance. When he saw a centurion,illustrious for his military exploits, leading off to prison by reasonof a judgment for debt, he ran up with his attendants in the middle ofthe forum and laid hands on him; and exclaiming aloud against theinsolence of the patricians, the cruelty of the usurers, and thegrievances of the commons, and the deserts and misfortunes of the man.""Then indeed,"" said he, ""in vain have I preserved the Capitol andcitadel by this right hand, if I am to see my fellow-citizen andfellow-soldier, as if captured by the victorious Gauls, dragged intoslavery and chains."" He then paid the debt to the creditor openly beforethe people, and having purchased his freedom with the scales and brass,he sets the man at liberty, whilst the latter implored both gods andmen, that they would grant a recompence to Marcus Manlius, hisliberator, the parent of the Roman commons; and being immediatelyreceived into the tumultuous crowd, he himself also increased thetumult, displaying the scars received in the Veientian, Gallic, andother succeeding wars: ""that he, whilst serving in the field, andrebuilding his dwelling which had been demolished, though he had paidoff the principal many times over, the interest always keeping down theprincipal, had been overwhelmed with interest: that through the kindinterference of Marcus Manlius, he now beheld the light, the forum, andthe faces of his fellow-citizens: that he received from him all the kindservices usually conferred by parents; that to him therefore he devotedwhatever remained of his person, of his life, and of his blood; whateverties subsisted between him and his country, public and private guardiandeities, were all centred in that one man."" When the commons, workedupon by these expressions, were now wholly in the interest of the oneindividual, another circumstance was added, emanating from a schemestill more effectually calculated to create general confusion. A farm inthe Veientian territory, the principal part of his estate, he subjectedto public sale: ""that I may not,"" says he, ""suffer any of you, Romans,as long as any of my property shall remain, to be dragged off to prison,after judgment has been given against him, and he has been consigned toa creditor."" That circumstance, indeed, so inflamed their minds, thatthey seemed determined on following the assertor of their freedomthrough every thing, right and wrong. Besides this, speeches [were made]at his house, as if he were delivering an harangue, full of imputationsagainst the patricians; among which he threw out, waving all distinctionwhether he said what was true or false, that treasures of the Gallicgold were concealed by the patricians; that ""they were now no longercontent with possessing the public lands, unless they appropriated thepublic money also; if that were made public, that the commons might befreed from their debt."" When this hope was presented to them, thenindeed it seemed a scandalous proceeding, that when gold was to becontributed to ransom the state from the Gauls, the collection was madeby a public tribute; that the same gold, when taken from the Gauls, hadbecome the plunder of a few. Accordingly they followed up the inquiry,where the furtive possession of so enormous a treasure could be kept;and when he deferred, and told them that he would inform them at theproper time, all other objects being given up, the attention of all wasdirected to this point; and it became evident that neither theirgratitude, if the information were true, nor their displeasure if itproved false, would know any bounds."Book 6,Chapter 15,"Matters being in this state, the dictator, being summoned home fromthe army, came into the city. A meeting of the senate being held on thefollowing day, when, having sufficiently sounded the inclinations of thepeople, he forbade the senate to leave him, attended by that body, heplaced his throne in the comitium, and sent his sergeant to MarcusManlius; who on being summoned by the dictator's order, after he hadgiven intimation to his party that a contest was at hand, came to thetribunal, attended by a numerous party. On the one side stood thesenate, on the other the people as if in battle-array, attentivelyobserving, each party, their respective leader. Then silence being made,the dictator said, ""I wish that I and the Roman patricians may agreewith the commons on all other matters, as I am confident we shall agreeon the business which regards you, and on that about which I am about tointerrogate you. I perceive that hopes have been raised by you in theminds of the citizens, that, with safety to the public credit, theirdebts may be paid off out of the Gallic treasures, which it is allegedthe leading patricians are secreting. To which proceeding so far am Ifrom being any obstruction, that on the contrary, Marcus Manlius, Iexhort you to free the Roman commons from the weight of interest; and totumble from their secreted spoil, those who lie now brooding on thosepublic treasures. If you refuse to do this, whether because you yourselfdesire to be a sharer in the spoil, or because the information isunfounded, I shall order you to be carried off to prison, nor will I anylonger suffer the multitude to be disquieted by you with delusivehopes."" To this Manlius replied, ""That it had not escaped him, that itwas not against the Volscians, who were enemies as often as it suitedthe interests of the patricians, nor against the Latins and Hernicians,whom they were driving into hostilities by false charges, but againsthim and the Roman commons, that he was appointed dictator. Now the warbeing dropped, which was only feigned, that an attack was being madeagainst himself; that the dictator now professed to defend the usurersagainst the commons; that now a charge and destruction was sought forhim out of the favour of the multitude. Does the crowd that surrounds myperson offend you,"" said he, ""Aulus Cornelius, and you, conscriptfathers? Why then do you not draw it away from me, each of you by yourown acts of kindness? by becoming surety, by delivering yourfellow-citizens from the stocks, by preventing those cast in law-suits,and assigned over to their creditors, from being dragged away to prison,by sustaining the necessities of others out of your own superfluities?But why do I exhort you to expend out of your own property? Fix somecapital; deduct from the principal what has been paid in interest; soonwill my crowd not be a whit more remarkable than that of any otherperson. But [I may be asked] why do I alone thus interest myself inbehalf of my fellow-citizens? I have no other answer to give, than ifyou were to ask me, why in the same way did I alone preserve the Capitoland the citadel. Both then I afforded the aid which I could to allcollectively, and now I will afford it to each individually. Now withrespect to the Gallic treasures, the mode of interrogation rendersdifficult a matter which in itself is easy. For why do you ask thatwhich you know? why do you order that which is in your own laps to beshaken out of them rather than resign it, unless some fraud lurksbeneath? The more you require your own impositions to be examined into,the more do I dread lest you should blind the eyes of those narrowlywatching you. Wherefore, it is not I that am to be compelled to discoveryour hoard, but you must be forced to produce it to the public."""Book 6,Chapter 16,"When the dictator ordered him to lay aside evasion, and urged him toprove the truth of his information, or to own the guilt of havingadvanced a false accusation against the senate, and of having exposedthem to the odium of a lying charge of concealment; when he refused tospeak, to meet the wishes of his enemies, he ordered him to be carriedoff to prison. When arrested by the sergeant, he said, ""O Jupiter,supremely great and good, imperial Juno, and Minerva, and ye other godsand goddesses, who inhabit the Capitol and citadel, do ye suffer yoursoldier and defender to be thus harassed by his enemies? Shall thisright hand, by which I beat off the Gauls from your temples, be now inbonds and chains?"" Neither the eyes nor ears of any one could wellendure the indignity [thus offered him], but the state, most patient oflegitimate authority, had rendered certain offices absolute tothemselves; nor did either the tribunes of the commons, nor the commonsthemselves, dare to raise their eyes or utter a sentence in oppositionto the dictatorial power. On Manlius being thrown into prison, itappears that a great part of the commons put on mourning, that a greatmany persons had let their hair and beard grow, and that a dejectedcrowd presented itself at the entrance of the prison. The dictatortriumphed over the Volscians; and that triumph was the occasion ratherof ill-will than of glory. For they murmured that ""it had been acquiredat home, not abroad, and that it was celebrated over a citizen, not overan enemy; that only one thing was wanting to his arrogance, that Manliuswas not led before his car."" And now the affair fell little short ofsedition, for the purpose of appeasing which, the senate, without thesolicitation of any one, suddenly becoming bountiful of their ownfree-will, decreed that a colony of two thousand Roman citizens shouldbe conducted to Satricum; two acres and half of land were assigned toeach. And when they considered this, both as scanty in itself, conferredon a few, and as a bribe for betraying Marcus Manlius, the sedition wasirritated by the remedy. And now the crowd of Manlius' partisans wasbecome more remarkable, both by their squalid attire and by theappearance of persons under prosecutions, and terror being removed bythe resignation of the dictatorship, after the triumph had set both thetongues and thoughts of men at liberty."Book 6,Chapter 17,"Expressions were therefore heard freely uttered of personsupbraiding the multitude, that ""by their favour they always raised theirdefenders to a precipice, then at the very critical moment of dangerthey forsook them. That in this way Spurius Cassius, when inviting thecommons to a share in the lands, in this way Spurius M¾lius, whenwarding off famine from the mouths of his fellow-citizens at his ownexpense, had been undone; thus Marcus Manlius was betrayed to hisenemies, whilst drawing forth to liberty and light one half of thestate, when sunk and overwhelmed with usury. That the commons fattenedtheir favourites that they might be slaughtered. Was this punishment tobe suffered, if a man of consular rank did not answer at the nod of adictator? Suppose that he had lied before, and that on that account hehad had no answer to make; what slave was ever imprisoned in punishmentof a lie? Did not the memory of that night present itself, which waswell nigh the last and an eternal one to the Roman name? nor any idea ofthe band of Gauls climbing up the Tarpeian rock? nor that of MarcusManlius himself, such as they had seen him in arms, covered with sweatand blood, after having in a manner rescued Jupiter himself from thehands of the enemy? Was a recompence made to the preserver of theircountry with their half pounds of corn? and would they suffer a person,whom they almost deified, whom they had set on a footing with Jupiter,at least with respect to the surname of Capitolinus, to drag out anexistence subject to the will of an executioner, chained in a prison andin darkness? Was there thus sufficient aid in one person for all; and norelief for one in so many?"" The crowd did not disperse from that placeeven during the night, and they threatened that they would break openthe prison; when that being conceded which they were about to take byforce, Manlius was discharged from prison by a decree of the senate; bywhich proceeding the sedition was not terminated, but a leader wassupplied to the sedition. About the same time the Latins and Hernicians,as also the colonists of Circeii and Velitr¾, when striving to clearthemselves of the charge [of being concerned] in the Volscian war, anddemanding back the prisoners, that they may punish them according totheir own laws, received a harsh answer; the colonists the severer,because being Roman citizens they had formed the abominable design ofattacking their own country. They were therefore not only refused withrespect to the prisoners, but notice was given them in the name of thesenate, who however forbore from such a proceeding in the case of theallies, instantly to depart from the city, from the presence and sightof the Roman people; lest the law of embassy, provided for theforeigner, not for the citizen, should afford them no protection."Book 6,Chapter 18,"The sedition excited by Manlius reassuming its former violence, onthe expiration of the year the election was held, and military tribuneswith consular power were elected from among the patricians; they wereServius Cornelius Maluginensis a third time, Publius Valerius Potitus asecond time, Marcus Furius Camillus, Servius Sulpicius Rufus a secondtime, Caius Papirius Crassus, Titus Quinctius Cincinnatus a second time.At the commencement of which year peace with foreign countries affordedevery opportunity both to the patricians and plebeians: to theplebeians, because not being called away by any levy, they conceivedhopes of destroying usury, whilst they had so influential a leader; tothe patricians, because their minds were not called away by any externalterror from relieving the evils existing at home. Accordingly, as bothsides arose much more strenuous then ever, Manlius also was present forthe approaching contest. Having summoned the commons to his house, heholds consultations both by night and day with the leading men amongstthem with respect to effecting a revolution of affairs, being filledwith a much higher degree both of spirit and of resentment than he hadbeen before. The recent ignominy had lighted up resentment in a mindunused to affront; it gave him additional courage, that the dictator hadnot ventured to the same extent against him, as Quinctius Cincinnatushad done in the case of Spurius M¾lius, and because the dictator had notonly endeavoured to avoid the unpopularity of his imprisonment byabdicating the dictatorship, but not even the senate could bear upagainst it. Elated by these considerations, and at the same timeexasperated, he set about inflaming the minds of the commons, alreadysufficiently heated of themselves: ""How long,"" says he, ""will you beignorant of your own strength, which nature has not wished even thebrutes to be ignorant of? At least count how many you are, and how manyenemies you have. Even if each of you were to attack an individualantagonist, still I should suppose that you would strive more vigorouslyin defence of liberty, than they in defence of tyranny. For as many ofyou as have been clients around each single patron, in the same numberwill ye be against a single enemy. Only make a show of war; ye shallhave peace. Let them see you prepared for open force; they themselveswill relax their pretensions. Collectively you must attempt something,or individually submit to every thing. How long will you look to me? Ifor my part will not be wanting to any of you: do you see that myfortune fail not. I, your avenger, when my enemies thought well of it,was suddenly reduced to nothing; and you all in a body beheld thatperson thrown into chains, who had warded off chains from each one ofyou. What am I to hope, if my enemies attempt more against me? Am I toexpect the fate of Cassius and M¾lius? You acted kindly in appearingshocked at it: the gods will avert it: but never will they come downfrom heaven on my account: they must inspire you with a determination toavert it; as they inspired me, in arms and in peace, to defend you frombarbarous foes and tyrannical fellow-citizens. Is the spirit of so greata people so mean, that aid against your adversaries always satisfiesyou? And are you not to know any contest against the patricians, excepthow you may suffer them to domineer over you? Nor is this implanted inyou by nature; but you are theirs by possession. For why is it you bearsuch spirit with respect to foreigners, as to think it meet that youshould rule over them? because you have been accustomed to vie with themfor empire, against these to essay liberty rather than to maintain it.Nevertheless, whatsoever sort of leaders you have, whatever has beenyour own conduct, ye have up to this carried every thing which ye havedemanded, either by force, or your own good fortune. It is now time toaim at still higher objects. Only make trial both of your own goodfortune, and of me, who have been, as I hope, already tried to youradvantage. Ye will with less difficulty set up some one to rule thepatricians, than ye have set up persons to resist their rule.Dictatorships and consulships must be levelled to the ground, that theRoman commons may be able to raise their heads. Wherefore stand by me,prevent judicial proceedings from going on regarding money. I professmyself the patron of the commons--a title with which my solicitude andzeal invests me. If you will dignify your leader by any moredistinguishing title of honour or command, ye will render him still morepowerful to obtain what ye desire."" From this his first attempt is saidto have arisen with respect to the obtaining of regal power; but nosufficiently clear account is handed down, either with whom [he acted],or how far his designs extended."Book 6,Chapter 19,"But, on the other side, the senate began to deliberate regarding thesecession of the commons into a private house, and that, as it sohappened, situate in the citadel, and regarding the great danger thatwas threatening liberty. Great numbers cry out, that a Servilius Ahalawas wanted, who would not irritate a public enemy by ordering him to beled to prison, but would finish an intestine war with the loss of onecitizen. They came to a resolution milder in terms, but possessing thesame force, that the magistrates should see that ""the commonwealthreceived no detriment from the designs of Marcus Manlius."" Then theconsular tribunes, and the tribunes of the commons, (for these also hadsubmitted to the authority of the senate, because they saw that thetermination of their own power and of the liberty of all would be thesame,) all these then consult together as to what was necessary to bedone. When nothing suggested itself to the mind of any, except violenceand bloodshed, and it was evident that that would be attended with greatrisk; then Marcus M¾nius, and Quintus Publilius, tribunes of thecommons, say, ""Why do we make that a contest between the patricians andcommons, which ought to be between the state and one pestilent citizen?Why do we attack, together with the commons, a man whom it is safer toattack through the commons themselves, that he may fall overpowered byhis own strength? We have it in contemplation to appoint a day of trialfor him. Nothing is less popular than regal power; as soon as themultitude shall perceive that the contest is not with them, and thatfrom advocates they are to be made judges, and shall behold theprosecutors from among the commons, the accused a patrician, and thatthe charge between both parties is that of aiming at regal power, theywill favour no object more than their own liberty."""Book 6,Chapter 20,"With the approbation of all, they appoint a day of trial forManlius. When this took place, the commons were at first excited,especially when they saw the accused in a mourning habit, and with himnot only none of the patricians, but not even any of his kinsmen orrelatives, nay, not even his brothers Aulus and Titus Manlius; acircumstance which had never occurred before, that at so critical ajuncture a man's nearest friends did not put on mourning. When AppiusClaudius was thrown into prison [they remarked], that Caius Claudius,who was at enmity with him and the entire Claudian family, appeared inmourning; that this favourite of the people was about to be destroyed bya conspiracy, because he was the first who had come over from thepatricians to the commons. When the day arrived, I find in no author,what acts were alleged by the prosecutors against the accused bearingproperly on the charge of aspiring to kingly power, except hisassembling the multitude, and his seditious expressions and hislargesses, and pretended discovery; nor have I any doubt that they wereby no means unimportant, as the people's delay in condemning him wasoccasioned not by the merits of the cause, but by the place of trial.This seems deserving of notice, that men may know what great andglorious achievements his depraved ambition of regal power rendered notonly bereft of all merit, but absolutely hateful. He is said to havebrought forward near four hundred persons to whom he had lent moneywithout interest, whose goods he had prevented from being sold, whom hehad prevented from being carried off to prison after being adjudged totheir creditors. Besides this, that he not only enumerated also hismilitary rewards, but also produced them to view; spoils of enemiesslain up to thirty; presents from generals to the number of forty; inwhich the most remarkable were two mural crowns and eight civic. Inaddition to this, that he brought forward citizens saved from the enemy,amongst whom was mentioned Caius Servilius, when master of the horse,now absent. Then after he had recounted his exploits in war, in pompouslanguage suitable to the dignity of the subject, equalling his actionsby his eloquence, he bared his breast marked with scars received inbattle: and now and then, directing his eyes to the Capitol, he calleddown Jupiter and the other gods to aid him in his present lot; and heprayed, that the same sentiments with which they had inspired him whenprotecting the fortress of the Capitol, for the preservation of theRoman people, they would now inspire the Roman people with in hiscritical situation: and he entreated them singly and collectively, thatthey would form their judgment of him with their eyes fixed on theCapitol and citadel and their faces turned to the immortal gods. As thepeople were summoned by centuries in the field of Mars, and as theaccused, extending his hands towards the Capitol, directed his prayersfrom men to the gods; it became evident to the tribunes, that unlessthey removed the eyes of men also from the memory of so great anexploit, the best founded charge would find no place in mindsprejudiced by services. Thus the day of trial being adjourned, a meetingof the people was summoned in the PÏteline grove outside the Nomentangate, from whence there was no view of the Capitol; there the charge wasmade good, and their minds being now unmoved [by adventitiouscircumstances], a fatal sentence, and one which excited horror even inhis judges, was passed on him. There are some who state that he wascondemned by duumvirs appointed to inquire concerning cases of treason.The tribunes cast him down from the Tarpeian rock: and the same place inthe case of one man became a monument of distinguished glory and ofextreme punishment. Marks of infamy were offered to him when dead: one,a public one; that, when his house had been that where the temple ofMoneta and the mint-office now stand, it was proposed to the people,that no patrician should dwell in the citadel and Capitol: the otherappertaining to his family; it being commanded by a decree that no oneof the Manlian family should ever after bear the name of Marcus Manlius.Such was the fate of a man, who, had he not been born in a free state,would have been celebrated with posterity. In a short time, when therewas no longer any danger from him, the people, recollecting only hisvirtues, were seized with regret for him. A pestilence too which soonfollowed, no causes of so great a calamity presenting themselves, seemedto a great many to have arisen from the punishment inflicted on Manlius:""The Capitol"" [they said] ""had been polluted with the blood of itspreserver; nor was it agreeable to the gods that the punishment of himby whom their temples had been rescued from the hands of the enemy, hadbeen brought in a manner before their eyes."""Book 6,Chapter 21,"The pestilence was succeeded by a scarcity of the fruits of theearth, and the report of both calamities by spreading [was followed] bya variety of wars in the following year, Lucius Valerius a fourth time,Aulus Manlius a third time, Servius Sulpicius a third time, LuciusLucretius, Lucius ®milius a third time, Marcus Trebonius, being militarytribunes with consular power. Besides the Volscians, assigned by somefatality to give eternal employment to the Roman soldiery, and thecolonies of Circeii and Velitr¾, long meditating a revolt, and Latiumwhich had been suspected, new enemies suddenly sprung up in the peopleof Lanuvium, which had been a most faithful city. The fathers,considering that this arose from contempt, because the revolt of theirown citizens, the people of Velitr¾, had been so long unpunished,decreed that a proposition should be submitted to the people at theearliest opportunity on the subject of declaring war against them: andin order that the commons might be the more disposed for that service,they appointed five commissioners for distributing the Pomptine land,and three for conducting a colony to Nepete. Then it was proposed to thepeople that they should order a declaration of war; and the plebeiantribunes in vain endeavouring to dissuade them, all the tribes declaredfor war. That year preparations were made for war; the army was not ledout into the field on account of the pestilence. And that delay affordedfull time to the colonists to deprecate the anger of the senate; and agreat number of the people were disposed that a suppliant embassy shouldbe sent to Rome, had not the public been involved, as is usual, with theprivate danger, and the abettors of the revolt from the Romans, throughfear, lest they, being alone answerable for the guilt, might be given upas victims to the resentment of the Romans, dissuaded the colonies fromcounsels of peace. And not only was the embassy obstructed by them inthe senate, but a great part of the commons were excited to makepredatory excursions into the Roman territory. This new injury broke offall hope of peace. This year a report first originated regarding arevolt of the Pr¾nestines; and the people of Tusculum, Gabii and Lavici,into whose territories the incursions had been made, accusing them ofthe fact, the senate returned so placid an answer, that it becameevident that less credit was given to the charges, because they wishedthem not to be true."Book 6,Chapter 22,"In the following year the Papirii, Spurius and Lucius, new militarytribunes, led the legions to Velitr¾; their four colleagues in thetribuneship, Servius Cornelius Maluginensis a fourth time, QuintusServilius, Servius Sulpicius, Lucius ®milius a fourth time, being leftbehind to protect the city, and in case any new commotion should beannounced from Etruria; for every thing was apprehended from thatquarter. At Velitr¾ they fought a successful battle against theauxiliaries of the Pr¾nestines, who were almost greater than the numberof colonists themselves; so that the proximity of the city was both thecause of an earlier flight to the enemy, and was their only refuge afterthe flight. The tribunes refrained from besieging the town, both because[the result] was uncertain, and they considered that the war should notbe pushed to the total destruction of the colony. Letters were sent toRome to the senate with news of the victory, expressive of moreanimosity against the Pr¾nestine enemy than against those of Velitr¾. Inconsequence, by a decree of the senate and an order of the people, warwas declared against the Pr¾nestines: who, in conjunction with theVolscians, took, on the following year, Satricum, a colony of the Romanpeople, by storm, after an obstinate defence by the colonists, and made,with respect to the prisoners, a disgraceful use of their victory.Incensed at this, the Romans elected Marcus Furius Camillus a seventhtime military tribune. The colleagues conjoined with him were the twoPostumii Regillenses, Aulus and Lucius, and Lucius Furius, with LuciusLucretius and Marcus Fabius Ambustus. The Volscian war was decreed toMarcus Furius out of the ordinary course, Lucius Furius is assigned bylot from among the tribunes his assistant; [which proved] not soadvantageous to the public as a source of all manner of praise to hiscolleague: both on public grounds, because he restored the [Roman]interest which had been prostrated by his rash conduct; and on privategrounds, because from his error he sought to obtain his gratitude ratherthan his own glory. Camillus was now in the decline of life, and whenprepared at the election to take the usual oath for the purpose ofexcusing himself on the plea of his health, he was opposed by theconsent of the people: but his active mind was still vigorous within hisardent breast, and he enjoyed all his faculties entire, and now that heconcerned himself but little in civil affairs, war still aroused him.Having enlisted four legions of four thousand men each, and havingordered the troops to assemble the next day at the Esquiline gate, heset out to Satricum. There the conquerors of the colony, nowisedismayed, confiding in their number of men, in which they hadconsiderably the advantage, awaited him. When they perceived that theRomans were approaching, they marched out immediately to the field,determined to make no delay to put all to the risk of an engagement,that by proceeding thus they should derive no advantage from thejudgment of their distinguished commander, on which alone they confided."Book 6,Chapter 23,"The same ardour existed also in the Roman army; nor did any thing,but the wisdom and authority of one man, delay the fortune of thepresent engagement, who sought, by protracting the war, an opportunityof aiding their strength by skill. The enemy urged them the more on thataccount, and now not only did they draw out their troops in order ofbattle before their camp, but advanced into the middle of the plain, andby throwing up trenches near the battalions of the enemy, made a show oftheir insolent confidence in their strength. The Roman soldier wasindignant at this; the other military tribune, Lucius Furius, still moreso, who, encouraged both by his youth and his natural disposition, wasstill further elated by the hopes entertained by the multitude, whoassumed great spirits on grounds the most uncertain. The soldiers,already excited of themselves, he still further instigated bydisparaging the authority of his colleague by reference to his age, theonly point on which he could do so: saying constantly, ""that wars werethe province of young men, and that with the body the mind alsoflourishes and withers; that from having been a most vigorous warrior hewas become a drone; and that he who, on coming up, had been wont tocarry off camps and cities at the first onset, now consumed the timeinactive within the trenches. What accession to his own strength, ordiminution of that of the enemy, did he hope for? What opportunity, whatseason, what place for practising stratagem? that the old man's planswere frigid and languid. Camillus had both sufficient share of life aswell as of glory. What use was it to suffer the strength of a statewhich ought to be immortal, to sink into old age along with one mortalbody."" By such observations, he had attracted to himself the attentionof the entire camp; and when in every quarter battle was called for, ""Wecannot,"" he says, ""Marcus Furius, withstand the violence of thesoldiers; and the enemy, whose spirits we have increased by delaying,insults us by insolence by no means to be borne. Do you, who are but oneman, yield to all, and suffer yourself to be overcome in counsel, thatyou may the sooner overcome in battle."" To this Camillus replies, that""whatever wars had been waged up to that day under his single auspices,in these that neither himself nor the Roman people had beendissatisfied either with his judgment or with his fortune; now he knewthat he had a colleague, his equal in command and in authority, invigour of age superior; with respect to the army, that he had beenaccustomed to rule, not to be ruled; with his colleague's authority hecould not interfere. That he might do, with the favour of the gods,whatever he might deem to be to the interest of the state. That he wouldeven solicit for his years the indulgence, that he might not be placedin the front line; that whatever duties in war an old man coulddischarge, in these he would not be deficient; that he prayed to theimmortal gods, that no mischance might prove his plan to be the moreadvisable."" Neither his salutary advice was listened to by men, nor suchpious prayers by the gods. The adviser of the battle draws up the frontline; Camillus forms the reserve, and posts a strong guard before thecamp; he himself took his station on an elevated place as a spectator,anxiously watching the result of the other's plan."Book 6,Chapter 24,"As soon as the arms clashed at the first encounter, the enemy, fromstratagem, not from fear, retreated. There was a gentle acclivity intheir rear, between the army and their camp; and because they hadsufficient numbers, they had left in the camp several strong cohorts,armed and ready for action, which were to rush forth, when the battlewas now commenced, and when the enemy had approached the rampart. TheRoman being drawn into disadvantageous ground by following theretreating enemy in disorder, became exposed to this sally. Terrortherefore being turned on the victor, by reason of this new force, andthe declivity of the valley, caused the Roman line to give way. TheVolscians, who made the attack from the camp, being fresh, press onthem; those also who had given way by a pretended flight, renew thefight. The Roman soldiers no longer recovered themselves; but unmindfulof their recent presumption and former glory, were turning their backsin every direction, and with disorderly speed were making for theircamp, when Camillus, being mounted on his horse by those around him, andhastily opposing the reserved troops to them, ""Is this,"" says he,""soldiers, the battle which ye called for? What man, what god is there,whom ye can blame? That was your rashness, this your cowardice. Havingfollowed another leader, now follow Camillus; and as ye are accustomedto do under my leadership, conquer. Why do ye look to the rampart andcamp? Not a man of you shall that camp receive, except as victor."" Shameat first stopped their disorderly flight; then when they saw thestandards wheel about, and a line formed to meet the enemy, and thegeneral, besides being distinguished by so many triumphs, venerable alsoby his age, presented himself in front of the battalions, where thegreatest toil and danger was, every one began to upbraid both himselfand others, and mutual exhortation with a brisk shout pervaded theentire line. Nor was the other tribune deficient on the occasion. Beingdespatched to the cavalry by his colleague, who was restoring the lineof the infantry, not by rebuking them, (for which task his share intheir fault had rendered him an authority of little weight,) but fromcommand turning entirely to entreaties, he besought them individuallyand collectively, ""to redeem him from blame, who was answerable for theevents of that day. Notwithstanding the repugnance and dissuasion of mycolleague, I gave myself a partner in the rashness of all rather than inthe prudence of one. Camillus sees his own glory in your fortune,whatever it be; for my part, unless the battle is restored, I shall feelthe result with you all, the infamy alone (which is most distressing).""It was deemed best that the horse should be transferred into the linewhilst still unsteady, and that they should attack the enemy by fightingon foot. Distinguished by their arms and courage, they proceed inwhatever direction they perceive the line of the infantry most pressed;nor among either the officers or soldiers is there any abatementobserved from the utmost effort of courage. The result therefore feltthe aid of the bravery exerted; and the Volscians being put to realflight in that direction in which they had lately retreated underpretended fear, great numbers were slain both in the battle itself, andafterwards in flight; the others in the camp, which was taken in thesame onset: more, however, were captured than slain."Book 6,Chapter 25,"Where when, on taking an account of the prisoners, several Tusculanswere recognised, being separated from the rest, they are brought to thetribunes; and they confessed to those who interrogated them, that theyhad taken up arms by the authority of the state. By the fear of whichwar so near home Camillus being alarmed, says that he would immediatelycarry the prisoners to Rome, that the senate might not be ignorant, thatthe Tusculans had revolted from the alliance; meanwhile his colleague,if he thought proper, should command the camp and army. One day had beena lesson to him not to prefer his own counsels to better. Howeverneither himself, nor any person in the army, supposed that Camilluswould pass over his misconduct without some angry feelings, by which thecommonwealth had been brought into so perilous a situation; and both inthe army and at Rome, the uniform account of all was, that, as mattershad been conducted with varying success among the Volscians, the blameof the unsuccessful battle and of the flight lay with Lucius Furius, allthe glory of the successful one was to be attributed to Camillus. Theprisoners being brought into the senate, when the senate decreed thatthe Tusculans should be punished with war, and they intrusted themanagement of that war to Camillus, he requests one assistant forhimself in that business, and being allowed to select which ever of hiscolleagues he pleased, contrary to the expectation of every one, hesolicited Lucius Furius. By which moderation of feeling he bothalleviated the disgrace of his colleague, and acquired great glory tohimself. There was no war, however, with the Tusculans. By firmadherence to peace they warded off the Roman violence, which they couldnot have done by arms. When the Romans entered their territories, noremovals were made from the places adjoining to the road, thecultivation of the lands was not interrupted: the gates of the citylying open, they came forth in crowds clad in their gowns to meet thegenerals; provision for the army was brought with alacrity from the cityand the lands. Camillus having pitched his camp before the gates,wishing to know whether the same appearance of peace, which wasdisplayed in the country, prevailed also within the walls, entered thecity, where he beheld the gates lying open, and every thing exposed tosale in the open shops, and the workmen engaged each on their respectiveemployments, and the schools of learning buzzing with the voices of thescholars, and the streets filled amid the different kinds of people,with boys and women going different ways, whithersoever the occasions oftheir respective callings carried them; nothing in any quarter that boreany appearance of panic or even of surprise; he looked around at everyobject, attentively inquiring where the war had been. No trace was thereof any thing having been removed, or brought forward for the occasion;so completely was every thing in a state of steady tranquil peace, sothat it scarcely seemed that even the rumour of war could have reachedthem."Book 6,Chapter 26,"Overcome therefore by the submissive demeanour of the enemy, heordered their senate to be called. ""Tusculans,"" he says, ""ye are theonly persons who have yet found the true arms and the true strength, bywhich to protect your possessions from the resentment of the Romans.Proceed to Rome to the senate. The fathers will consider, whether youhave merited more punishment for your former conduct, or forgiveness foryour present. I shall not anticipate your gratitude for a favour to beconferred by the state. From me ye shall have the power of seekingpardon. The senate will grant to your entreaties such a result, as theyshall consider meet."" When the Tusculans came to Rome, and the senate[of a people], who were till a little before faithful allies, were seenwith sorrowful countenances in the porch of the senate-house, thefathers, immediately moved [at the sight,] even then ordered them to becalled in rather in a friendly than a hostile manner. The Tusculandictator spoke as follows: ""Conscript fathers, we against whom yeproclaimed and made war, just as you see us now standing in the porch ofyour house, so armed and so attired did we go forth to meet yourgenerals and your legions. This was our habit, this the habit of ourcommons; and ever shall be, unless whenever we shall receive arms fromyou and defence of you. We return thanks to your generals and yourtroops for having trusted their eyes more than their ears; and forhaving committed nothing hostile, where none subsisted. The peace, whichwe observed, the same we solicit at your hands: we pray you, avert warto that quarter where, if any where, it subsists. What your arms may beable to effect on us, if after our submission we are to experience it,we will experience unarmed. This is our determination. May the immortalgods grant that it be as successful as it is dutiful! With respect tothe charges, by which you were induced to declare war against us, thoughit is needless to refute by words what has been contradicted by facts;yet, admitting they were true, we think it safe for us to confess them,after having shown such evident marks of repentance. Admit then that wehave offended against you, since ye deserve that such satisfaction bemade to you."" These were nearly the words used by the Tusculans. Theyobtained peace at the present, and not long after the freedom of thestate also. The legions were withdrawn from Tusculum."Book 6,Chapter 27,"Camillus, distinguished by his prudence and bravery in the Volscianwar, by his success in the Tusculan expedition, in both by hisextraordinary moderation and forbearance towards his colleague, went outof office; the military tribunes for the following year being Lucius andPublius Valerius, Lucius a fifth, Publius a third time, and CaiusSergius a third time, Lucius Menenius a second time, Spurius Papirius,and Servius Cornelius Maluginensis. The year required censors also,chiefly on account of the uncertain representations regarding the debt;the tribunes of the commons exaggerating the amount of it on account ofthe odium of the thing, whilst it was underrated by those whose interestit was that the difficulty of procuring payment should appear to dependrather on [the want of] integrity, than of ability in the debtors. Thecensors appointed were Caius Sulpicius Camerinus, Spurius PostumiusRegillensis; and the matter having been commenced was interrupted by thedeath of Postumius, because it was not conformable to religion that asubstitute should be colleague to a censor. Accordingly after Sulpiciushad resigned his office, other censors having been appointed under somedefect, they did not discharge the office; that a third set should beappointed was not allowed, as though the gods did not admit a censorshipfor that year. The tribunes denied that such mockery of the commons wasto be tolerated; ""that the senate were averse to the public tablets, thewitnesses of each man's property, because they were unwilling that theamount of the debt should be seen, which would clearly show that onepart of the state was depressed by the other; whilst in the mean timethe commons, oppressed with debt, were exposed to one enemy afteranother. Wars were now sought out in every direction withoutdistinction. Troops were marched from Antium to Satricum, from Satricumto Velitr¾, and thence to Tusculum. The Latins, Hernicians, and thePr¾nestines were now threatened with hostilities, more through a hatredof their fellow-citizens than of the enemy, in order to wear out thecommons under arms, and not suffer them to breathe in the city, or toreflect on their liberty at their leisure, or to stand in an assemblywhere they may hear a tribune's voice discussing concerning thereduction of interest and the termination of other grievances. But ifthe commons had a spirit mindful of the liberty of their fathers, thatthey would neither suffer any Roman citizen to be assigned to a creditoron account of debt, nor a levy to be held; until, the debts beingexamined, and some method adopted for lessening them, each man shouldknow what was his own, and what another's; whether his person was stillfree to him, or that also was due to the stocks."" The price held out forsedition soon raised it: for both several were made over to creditors,and on account of the rumour of the Pr¾nestine war, the senate decreedthat new legions should be levied; both which measures began to beobstructed by tribunitian interposition and the combined efforts of thecommons. For neither the tribunes suffered those consigned to theircreditors to be thrown into prison, nor did the young men give in theirnames. While the senate felt less pressing anxiety about enforcing thelaws regarding the lending of money than about the levy; for now it wasannounced that the enemy, having marched from Pr¾neste, had encamped inthe Gabinian territory; meanwhile this very report rather aroused thetribunes of the commons to the struggle commenced than deterred them;nor did any thing else suffice to allay the discontent in the city, butthe approach of hostilities to the very walls."Book 6,Chapter 28,"For when the Pr¾nestines had been informed that no army was leviedat Rome, no general fixed on, that the senate and people were turned theone against the other; their leaders thinking that an opportunitypresented itself, making a hasty march, and laying waste the country asthey went along, they advanced their standards as far as the Collinegate. The panic in the city was great. The alarm was given to take uparms; persons ran together to the walls and gates, and at length turningfrom sedition to war, they created Titus Quinctius Cincinnatus dictator.He appointed Aulus Sempronius Atratinus his master of the horse. Whenthis was heard, (such was the terror of that office,) the enemy retiredfrom the walls, and the young Romans assembled to the edict withoutrefusal. Whilst the army is being levied at Rome, in the mean time theenemy's camp is pitched not far from the river Allia: thence layingwaste the land far and wide, they boasted one to the other that they hadchosen a place fatal to the Roman city; that there would be a similarconsternation and flight from thence as occurred in the Gallic war. For""if the Romans dread a day deemed inauspicious, and marked with the nameof that place, how much more than the Allian day would they dread theAllia itself, the monument of so great a disaster. No doubt the fiercelooks of the Gauls and the sound of their voices would recur to theireyes and ears."" Turning over in mind those groundless notions ofcircumstances as groundless, they rested their hopes on the fortune ofthe place. On the other hand, the Romans [considered] that, ""in whateverplace a Latin enemy stood, they knew full well that they were the samewhom, after having utterly defeated at the lake Regillus, they kept inpeaceable subjection for one hundred years; that the place beingdistinguished by the memory of their defeat, would rather stimulate themto blot out the remembrance of their disgrace, than raise a fear thatany land should be unfavourable to their success. Were even the Gaulsthemselves presented to them in that place, that they would fight justas they fought at Rome in recovering their country, as the day after atGabii; then, when they took care, that no enemy, who had entered thewalls of Rome, should carry home an account of their success or defeat."""Book 6,Chapter 29,"With these feelings on either side they came to the Allia. The Romandictator, when the enemy were in view drawn up and ready for action,says, ""Aulus Sempronius, do you see that these men have taken theirstand at the Allia, relying on the fortune of the place? nor have theimmortal gods granted them any thing of surer confidence, or any moreeffectual support. But do you, relying on arms and on courage, make abrisk charge on the middle of their line; I will bear down on them whenthrown into disorder and consternation with the legions. Ye gods,witnesses of the treaty, assist us, and exact the penalty, due foryourselves having been violated, and for us who have been deceivedthrough the appeal made to your divinity."" The Pr¾nestines sustained notthe attack of cavalry, or infantry; their ranks were broken at the firstcharge and shout. Then when their line maintained its ground in noquarter, they turn their backs; and being thrown into consternation andcarried beyond their own camp by their panic, they stop not from theirprecipitate speed, until Pr¾neste came in view. There, having beendispersed in consequence of their flight, they select a post for thepurpose of fortifying it in a hasty manner; lest, if they betookthemselves within the walls, the country should be burned forthwith, andwhen all places should be desolated, siege should be laid to the city.But when the victorious Romans approached, the camp at the Allia havingbeen plundered, that fortress also was abandoned, and considering thewalls scarcely secure, they shut themselves up within the town ofPr¾neste. There were eight towns besides under the sway of thePr¾nestines. Hostilities were carried round to these also; and thesebeing taken one after the other without much difficulty, the army wasled to Velitr¾. This also was taken by storm. They then came toPr¾neste, the main source of the war. That town was obtained, not byforce, but by capitulation. Titus Quinctius, being once victorious in apitched battle, having taken also two camps belonging to the enemy, andnine towns by storm, and Pr¾neste being obtained by surrender, returnedto Rome: and in his triumph brought into the Capitol the statue ofJupiter Imperator, which he had conveyed from Pr¾neste. It was dedicatedbetween the recesses of Jupiter and Minerva, and a tablet fixed underit, as a monument of his exploits, was engraved with nearly these words:""Jupiter and all the gods granted, that Titus Quinctius, dictator,should take nine towns."" On the twentieth day after the appointment heabdicated the dictatorship."Book 6,Chapter 30,"An election was then held of military tribunes with consular power;in which the number of patricians and plebeians was equal. From thepatricians were elected Publius and Caius Manlius, with Lucius Julius;the commons gave Caius Sextilius, Marcus Albinius, and Lucius Antistius.To the Manlii, because they had the advantage of the plebeians in familystation, and of Julius in interest, the province of the Volscians wasassigned out of the ordinary course, without lots, or mutualarrangement; of which circumstance both themselves and the patricianswho conferred it afterwards repented. Without any previous reconnoitrethey sent out some cohorts to forage. It having been falsely reportedto them that these were ensnared, whilst they march in great haste, inorder to support them, without even retaining the author [of the report]who had deceived them, he being a Latin enemy instead of a Romansoldier, they themselves fell into an ambuscade. There, whilst theysuffer and commit great havoc, making resistance on disadvantageousground solely by the valour of the soldiers, the enemy in the mean timein another quarter attacked the Roman camp which was situate on a plain.By their temerity and want of skill, matters were brought into jeopardyin both places by the generals. Whatever portion [of the army] wassaved, the good fortune of the Roman people, and the steady valour ofthe soldiers, even without a director, protected. When an account ofthese events was brought to Rome, it was at first agreeable to them thata dictator should be appointed; then when intelligence was received fromthe Volscian country that matters were quiet, and it appeared manifestthat they knew not how to take advantage of victory and of opportunity,the army and generals were recalled from thence also; and there wasquiet from that quarter, as far as regarded the Volscians. The onlydisturbance there was towards the end of the year was, that thePr¾nestines, having stirred up some of the states of the Latins, renewedhostilities. During the same year new colonists were enrolled for Setia,the colony itself complaining of the paucity of men. Domestictranquillity, which the influence of the plebeian military tribunes andthe respect shown to them among their own party procured, was aconsolation for the want of success in war."Book 6,Chapter 31,"The commencement of the following year blazed forth with violentsedition, the military tribunes with consular power being SpuriusFurius, Quintus Servilius a second time, Caius Licinius, PubliusClÏlius, Marcus Horatius, Lucius Geganius. The debt was both theground-work and cause of the disturbance: for the purpose ofascertaining which Spurius Servilius Priscus and Quintus ClÏliusSiculus, being appointed censors, were prevented by war from proceedingin the business. For alarming news at first, then the flight [of thecountry people] from the lands, brought intelligence that the legions ofthe Volscians had entered the borders, and were laying waste the Romanland in every direction. In which alarm, so far was the fear of theforeign enemy from putting a check to the domestic feuds, that on thecontrary the tribunitian power became even more vehement in obstructingthe levy; until these conditions were imposed on the patricians, that noone was to pay tribute as long as the war lasted, nor issue any judicialprocess respecting money due. This relaxation being obtained for thecommons, there was no delay with respect to the levy. New legions beingenlisted, it was resolved that two armies should be led into theVolscian territory, the legions being divided. Spurius Furius and MarcusHoratius proceed to the right, towards the sea-coast and Antium; QuintusServilius and Lucius Geganius to the left, to Ecetra towards themountains. On neither side did the enemy meet them. Devastation wastherefore committed, not similar to that straggling kind which theVolscian had practised by snatches under the influence of trepidationafter the manner of a banditti, relying on the dissensions among theenemy and dreading their valour; but committed with the full meed oftheir resentment by a regular army, more severe also by reason of theircontinuance. For the incursions had been made by the Volscians on theskirts of the borders, as they were afraid lest an army might in themean time come forth from Rome: the Romans, on the contrary, had amotive for tarrying in the enemy's country, in order to entice them toan engagement. All the houses therefore on the lands, and some villagesalso, being burnt down, not a fruit-tree nor the seed being left for thehope of a harvest, all the booty both of men and cattle, which wasoutside the walls, being driven off, the troops were led back from bothquarters to Rome."Book 6,Chapter 32,"A short interval having been granted to the debtors to recoverbreath, when matters became perfectly quiet with respect to the enemy,legal proceedings began to be instituted anew; and so remote was allhope of relieving the former debt, that a new one was now contracted bya tax for building a wall of hewn stone bargained for by the censors: towhich burden the commons were obliged to submit, because the tribunes ofthe commons had no levy which they could obstruct. Forced by theinfluence of the nobles, they elected all the military tribunes fromamong the patricians, Lucius ®milius, Publius Valerius a fourth time,Caius Veturius, Servius Sulpicius, Lucius and Caius QuinctiusCincinnatus. By the same influence they succeeded in raising threearmies against the Latins and Volscians, who with combined forces wereencamped at Satricum, all the juniors being bound by the military oathwithout any opposition; one army for the protection of the city; theother to be sent for the sudden emergencies of war, if any disturbanceshould arise elsewhere. The third, and by far the most powerful, PubliusValerius and Lucius ®milius led to Satricum. Where when they found theenemy's line of battle drawn up on level ground, they immediatelyengaged; and before the victory was sufficiently declared, the battle,which held out fair hopes of success, was put a stop to by rainaccompanied by a violent storm of wind. On the following day the battlewas renewed; and for a considerable time the Latin troops particularly,who had learned the Roman discipline during the long confederacy, stoodtheir ground with equal bravery and success. A charge of cavalry broketheir ranks; when thus confused, the infantry advanced upon them; and asmuch as the Roman line advanced, so much were the enemy dislodged fromtheir ground; and when once the battle gave way, the Roman prowessbecame irresistible. When the enemy being routed made for Satricum,which was two miles distant, not for their camp, they were cut downchiefly by the cavalry; their camp was taken and plundered. The nightsucceeding the battle, they betake themselves to Antium in a marchresembling a flight; and though the Roman army followed them almost intheir steps, fear however possessed more swiftness than anger. Whereforethe enemy entered the walls before the Roman could annoy or impede theirrear. After that several days were spent in laying waste the country, asthe Romans were neither supplied with military engines to attack walls,nor the others to hazard the chance of a battle."Book 6,Chapter 33,"At this time a dissension arose between the Antians and the Latins;when the Antians, overcome by misfortunes and reduced by a war, in whichthey had both been born and had grown old, began to think of asurrender; whilst their recent revolt after a long peace, their spiritsbeing still fresh, rendered the Latins more determined to persevere inthe war. There was an end to the contest, when it became evident to bothparties that neither would stand in the way of the other so as toprevent them from following out their own views. The Latins by departingredeemed themselves from a share in what they deemed a dishonourablepeace. The Antians, on the removal of those who by their presenceimpeded their salutary counsels, surrender their city and lands to theRomans. The resentment and rage of the Latins, because they were neitherable to damage the Romans in war, nor to retain the Volscians in arms,vented itself in setting fire to the city of Satricum, which had beentheir first place of retreat after their defeat; nor did any otherbuilding in that city remain, since they cast firebrandsindiscriminately into those sacred and profane, except the temple ofMother Matuta. From that neither the sanctity of the building itself,nor respect for the gods, is said to have restrained them, but an awfulvoice, emitted from the temple with threats of dismal vengeance, unlessthey removed their abominable fires to a distance from the temples.Fired with this rage, their impetuosity carried them on to Tusculum,under the influence of resentment, because, having abandoned the generalassociation of the Latins, they joined themselves not only in alliancewith the Romans, but also as members of their state. As theyunexpectedly rushed in at the gates, which were lying open, the town,except the citadel, was taken at the first shout. The townsmen withtheir wives and children took refuge in the citadel, and sent messengersto Rome, to inform the senate of their situation. An army was led toTusculum with no less expedition than was worthy of the honour of theRoman people. Lucius Quinctius and Servius Sulpicius, military tribunes,commanded it. They beheld the gates of Tusculum shut, and the Latins,with the feelings of besiegers and besieged, on the one side defendingthe walls of Tusculum, on the other hand attacking the citadel; theystruck terror and felt it at the same time. The arrival of the Romansproduced a change in the minds of both parties: it turned the Tusculansfrom great alarm into the utmost alacrity, and the Latins from almostassured confidence of soon taking the citadel, as they were masters ofthe town, to very slender hope of even their own safety. A shout israised by the Tusculans from the citadel; it is answered by a muchlouder one from the Roman army. The Latins are hard pressed on bothsides: they neither withstand the force of the Tusculans pouring down onthem from the higher ground; nor are they able to repel the Romansadvancing up to the walls, and forcing the bars of the gates. The wallswere first taken by scalade; the gates were then broken open; and whenthe two enemies pressed them both in front and in the rear, nor didthere remain any strength for fight, nor any room for running away,between both they were all cut to pieces to a man. Tusculum beingrecovered from the enemy, the army was led back to Rome."Book 6,Chapter 34,"In proportion as all matters were more tranquil abroad inconsequence of their successes in war this year, so much did theviolence of the patricians and the distresses of the commons in the cityincrease every day; as the ability to pay was prevented by the very factthat it was necessary to pay. Accordingly, when nothing could now bepaid out of their property, being cast in suits and assigned over tocustody, they satisfied their creditors by their character and persons,and punishment was substituted for payment. Wherefore not only thelowest, but even the leading men in the commons had sunk so low inspirit, that no enterprising and adventurous man had courage, not onlyto stand for the military tribuneship among the patricians, (for whichprivilege they had strained all their energies,) but not even to take onthem and sue for plebeian magistracies: and the patricians seemed tohave for ever recovered the possession of an honour that had been onlyusurped by the commons for a few years. A trifling cause, as generallyhappens, which had the effect of producing a mighty result, intervenedto prevent the other party from exulting too much in that. Two daughtersof Marcus Fabius Ambustus, an influential man, both among persons of hisown station, and also with the commons, because he was by no meansconsidered a despiser of persons of that order, had been married, theelder to Servius Sulpicius, the younger to Caius Licinius Stolo, adistinguished person, but still a plebeian; and the fact of such analliance not having been scorned, had gained influence for Fabius withthe people. It so happened, that when the two sisters, the Fabi¾, werepassing away the time in conversation in the house of Servius Sulpicius,military tribune, a lictor of Sulpicius, when he returned home from theforum, rapped at the door, as is usual, with the rod. When the youngerFabia, a stranger to this custom, was frightened at it, she was laughedat by her sister, who was surprised at her sister not knowing thematter. That laugh, however, gave a sting to the female mind, sensitiveas it is to mere trifles. From the number of persons attending on her,and asking her commands, her sister's match, I suppose, appeared to herto be a fortunate one, and she repined at her own, according to thaterroneous feeling, by which every one is most annoyed at beingoutstripped by those nearest to him. When her father happened to see herdisappointed after the recent mortification, by kindly inquiring heprevailed on her, who was dissembling the cause of her annoyance, (asbeing neither affectionate with respect to her sister, nor respectfultowards her husband,) to confess, that the cause of her chagrin was,that she had been united to an inferior, and married into a house whichneither honour nor influence could enter. Ambustus then, consoling hisdaughter, bid her keep up good spirits; that she should soon see thesame honours at her own house, which she now sees at her sister's. Uponthis he began to draw up his plans with his son-in-law, having attachedto himself Lucius Sextius, an enterprising young man, and one to whosehope nothing was wanting but patrician descent."Book 6,Chapter 35,"There appeared a favourable opportunity for making innovations onaccount of the immense load of debt, no alleviation of which evil thecommons could hope for unless their own party were placed in the highestauthority. To [bring about] that object [they saw] that they shouldexert themselves. That the plebeians, by endeavouring and persevering,had already gained a step towards it, whence, if they struggled forward,they might reach the summit, and be on a level with the patricians, inhonour as well as in merit. For the present it was resolved thatplebeian tribunes should be created, in which office they might open forthemselves a way to other honours. And Caius Licinius and LuciusSextius, being elected tribunes, proposed laws all against the power ofthe patricians, and for the interests of the commons: one regarding thedebt, that, whatever had been paid in interest being deduced from theprincipal, the remainder should be paid off in three years by equalinstalments; the other concerning the limitation of land, that no oneshould possess more than five hundred acres of land; a third, that thereshould be no election of military tribunes, and that one at least of theconsuls should be elected from the commons; all matters of greatimportance, and such as could not be attained without the greateststruggles. A contest therefore for all those objects, of which there isever an inordinate desire among men, viz. land, money, and honours,being now proposed, the patricians became terrified and dismayed, andfinding no other remedy in their public and private consultations exceptthe protest, which had been tried in many previous contests, they gainedover their colleagues to oppose the bills of the tribunes. When they sawthe tribes summoned by Licinius and Sextius to announce their votes,surrounded by bands of patricians, they neither suffered the bills to beread, nor any other usual form for taking the votes of the commons to begone through. And now assemblies being frequently convened to nopurpose, when the propositions were now considered as rejected; ""It isvery well,"" says Sextius; ""since it is determined that a protest shouldpossess so much power, by that same weapon will we protect the people.Come, patricians, proclaim an assembly for the election of militarytribunes; I will take care that that word, I FORBID IT, which you listento our colleagues chaunting with so much pleasure, shall not be verydelightful to you."" Nor did the threats fall ineffectual: no electionswere held, except those of ¾diles and plebeian tribunes. Licinius andSextius, being re-elected plebeian tribunes, suffered not any curulemagistrates to be appointed, and this total absence of magistratescontinued in the city for the space of five years, the peoplere-electing the two tribunes, and these preventing the election ofmilitary tribunes."Book 6,Chapter 36,"There was an opportune cessation of other wars: the colonists ofVelitr¾, becoming wanton through ease, because there was no Roman army,made repeated incursions on the Roman territory, and set about layingsiege to Tusculum. This circumstance, the Tusculans, old allies, newfellow-citizens, imploring aid, moved not only the patricians, but thecommons also, chiefly with a sense of honour. The tribunes of thecommons relaxing their opposition, the elections were held by theinterrex; and Lucius Furius, Aulus Manlius, Servius Sulpicius, ServiusCornelius, Publius and Caius Valerius, found the commons by no means socomplying in the levy as in the elections; and an army having beenraised amid great contention, they set out, and not only dislodged theenemy from Tusculum, but shut them up even within their own walls.Velitr¾ began to be besieged by a much greater force than that withwhich Tusculum had been besieged; nor still could it be taken by thoseby whom the siege had been commenced. The new military tribunes wereelected first: Quintius Servilius, Caius Veturius, Aulus and MarcusCornelius, Quintus Quinctius, Marcus Fabius. Nothing worthy of mentionwas performed even by these at Velitr¾. Matters were involved in greaterperil at home: for besides Sextius and Licinius, the proposers of thelaws, re-elected tribunes of the commons now for the eighth time, Fabiusalso, military tribune, father-in-law of Stolo, avowed himself theunhesitating supporter of those laws of which he had been the adviser.And whereas, there had been at first eight of the college of theplebeian tribunes protesters against the laws, there were now only five:and (as is usual with men who leave their own party) dismayed andastounded, they in words borrowed from others, urged as a reason fortheir protest, that which had been taught them at home; ""that a greatnumber of the commons were absent with the army at Velitr¾; that theassembly ought to be deferred till the coming of the soldiers, that theentire body of the commons might give their vote concerning their owninterests."" Sextius and Licinius with some of their colleagues, andFabius one of the military tribunes, well-versed now by an experience ofmany years in managing the minds of the commons, having brought forwardthe leading men of the patricians, teased them by interrogating them oneach of the subjects which were about to be brought before the people:""would they dare to demand, that when two acres of land a head weredistributed among the plebeians, they themselves should be allowed tohave more than five hundred acres? that a single man should possess theshare of nearly three hundred citizens; whilst his portion of landscarcely extended for the plebeian to a stinted habitation and a placeof burial? Was it their wish that the commons, surrounded with usury,should surrender their persons to the stocks and to punishment, ratherthan pay off their debt by [discharging] the principal; and that personsshould be daily led off from the forum in flocks, after being assignedto their creditors, and that the houses of the nobility should be filledwith prisoners? and that wherever a patrician dwelt, there should be aprivate prison?"""Book 6,Chapter 37," When they had uttered these statements, exasperating and pitiablein the recital, before persons alarmed for themselves, exciting greaterindignation in the hearers than was felt by themselves, they affirmed""that there never would be any other limit to their occupying the lands,or to their butchering the commons by usury, unless the commons were toelect one consul from among the plebeians, as a guardian of theirliberty. That the tribunes of the commons were now despised, as being anoffice which breaks down its own power by the privilege of protest. Thatthere could be no equality of right, where the dominion was in the handsof the one party, assistance only in that of the other. Unless theauthority were shared, the commons would never enjoy an equal share inthe commonwealth; nor was there any reason why any one should think itenough that plebeians were taken into account at the consular elections;unless it were made indispensable that one consul at least should befrom the commons, no one would be elected. Or had they alreadyforgotten, that when it had been determined that military tribunesshould be elected rather than consuls, for this reason, that the highesthonours should be opened to plebeians also, no one out of the commonswas elected military tribune for forty-four years? How could theysuppose, that they would voluntarily confer, when there are but twoplaces, a share of the honour on the commons, who at the election ofmilitary tribunes used to monopolize the eight places? and that theywould suffer a way to be opened to the consulship, who kept thetribuneship so long a time fenced up? That they must obtain by a law,what could not be obtained by influence at elections; and that oneconsulate must be set apart out of the way of contest, to which thecommons may have access; since when left open to dispute it is sure everto become the prize of the more powerful. Nor can that now be alleged,which they used formerly to boast of, that there were not among theplebeians qualified persons for curule magistracies. For, was thegovernment conducted with less activity and less vigour, since thetribunate of Publius Licinius Calvus, who was the first plebeian electedto that office, than it was conducted during those years when no one butpatricians was a military tribune? Nay, on the contrary, severalpatricians had been condemned after their tribuneship, no plebeian.Qu¾stors also, as military tribunes, began to be elected from thecommons a few years before; nor had the Roman people been dissatisfiedwith any one of them. The consulate still remained for the attainment ofthe plebeians; that it was the bulwark, the prop of their liberty. Ifthey should attain that, then that the Roman people would consider thatkings were really expelled from the city, and their liberty firmlyestablished. For from that day that every thing in which the patricianssurpassed them, would flow in on the commons, power and honour, militaryglory, birth, nobility, valuable at present for their own enjoyment,sure to be left still more valuable to their children."" When they sawsuch discourses favourably listened to, they publish a new proposition;that instead of two commissioners for performing religious rites, tenshould be appointed; so that one half should be elected out of thecommons, the other half from the patricians; and they deferred themeeting [for the discussion] of all those propositions, till the comingof that army which was besieging Velitr¾."Book 6,Chapter 38,"The year was completed before the legions were brought back fromVelitr¾. Thus the question regarding the laws was suspended and deferredfor the new military tribunes; for the commons re-elected the same twoplebeian tribunes, because they were the proposers of the laws. TitusQuinctius, Servius Cornelius, Servius Sulpicius, Spurius Servilius,Lucius Papirius, Lucius Valerius, were elected military tribunes.Immediately at the commencement of the year the question about the lawswas pushed to the extreme of contention; and when the tribes werecalled, nor did the protest of their colleagues prevent the proposers ofthe laws, the patricians being alarmed have recourse to their two lastaids, to the highest authority and the highest citizen. It is resolvedthat a dictator be appointed: Marcus Furius Camillus is appointed, whonominates Lucius ®milius his master of the horse. To meet so powerful ameasure of their opponents, the proposers of the laws also set forth thepeople's cause with great determination of mind, and having convened anassembly of the people, they summon the tribes to vote. When thedictator took his seat, accompanied by a band of patricians, full ofanger and of threats, and the business was going on at first with theusual contention of the plebeian tribunes, some proposing the law andothers protesting against it, and though the protest was more powerfulby right, still it was overpowered by the popularity of the lawsthemselves and of their proposers, and when the first tribes pronounced,""Be it as you propose,"" then Camillus says, ""Since, Romans, tribunitianextravagance, not authority, sways you now, and ye are rendering theright of protest, acquired formerly by a secession of the commons,totally unavailing by the same violent conduct by which you acquired it,I, as dictator, will support the right of protest, not more for theinterest of the whole commonwealth than for your sake; and by myauthority I will defend your rights of protection, which have beenoverturned. Wherefore if Caius Licinius and Lucius Sextius give way tothe protest of their colleagues, I shall not introduce a patricianmagistrate into an assembly of the commons. If, in opposition to theright of protest, they will strive to saddle laws on the state as thoughcaptive, I will not suffer the tribunitian power to be destroyed byitself."" When the plebeian tribunes still persisted in the matter withunabated energy and contemptuously, Camillus, being highly provoked,sent his lictors to disperse the commons; and added threats, that ifthey persisted he would bind down the younger men by the military oath,and would forthwith lead an army out of the city. He struck great terrorinto the people; by the opposition he rather inflamed than lessened thespirits of their leaders. But the matter inclining neither way, heabdicated his dictatorship, either because he had been appointed withsome informality, as some have stated; or because the tribunes of thepeople proposed to the commons, and the commons passed it, that ifMarcus Furius did any thing as dictator, he should be fined five hundredthousand _asses_. But both the disposition of the man himself, and thefact that Publius Manlius was immediately substituted as dictator forhim, incline me to believe, that he was deterred rather by some defectin the auspices than by this unprecedented order. What could be the useof appointing him (Manlius) to manage a contest in which Camillus hadbeen defeated? and because the following year had the same Marcus Furiusdictator, who certainly would not without shame have resumed anauthority which but the year before had been worsted in his hands; atthe same time, because at the time when the motion about fining him issaid to have been published, he could either resist this order, by whichhe saw himself degraded, or he could not have obstructed those otherson account of which this was introduced, and throughout the whole seriesof disputes regarding the tribunitian and consular authority, even downto our own memory, the pre-eminence of the dictatorship was alwaysdecided."Book 6,Chapter 39,"Between the abdication of the former dictatorship and the new oneentered on by Manlius, an assembly of the commons being held by thetribunes, as if it were an interregnum, it became evident which of thelaws proposed were more grateful to the commons, which to the proposers.For they passed the bills regarding the interest and the land, rejectedthe one regarding the plebeian consulate. And both decisions would havebeen carried into effect, had not the tribunes declared that theyconsulted the people on all the laws collectively. Publius Manlius,dictator, then inclined the advantage to the side of the people, bynaming Caius Licinius from the commons, who had been military tribune,as master of the horse. The patricians, I understand, were muchdispleased at this nomination, but the dictator used to excuse himselfto the senate, alleging the near relationship between him and Licinius;at the same time denying that the authority of master of the horse washigher than that of consular tribune. When the elections for theappointment of plebeian tribunes were declared, Licinius and Sextius soconducted themselves, that by denying that they any longer desired acontinuation of the honour, they most powerfully stimulated the commonsto effectuate that which they were anxious for notwithstanding theirdissimulation. ""That they were now standing the ninth year as it were inbattle-array against the patricians, with the greatest danger to theirprivate interests, without any benefit to the public. That the measurespublished, and the entire strength of the tribunitian authority, hadgrown old with them; the attack was made on their propositions, first bythe protest of their colleagues, then by banishing their youth to thewar at Velitr¾; at length the dictatorial thunder was levelled againstthem. That now neither colleagues, nor war, nor dictator stood in theirway; as being a man, who by nominating a plebeian as master of thehorse, has even given an omen for a plebeian consul. That the commonsretarded themselves and their interests. They could, if they liked, havethe city and forum free from creditors, their lands immediately freefrom unjust possessors. Which kindnesses, when would they ever estimatethem with sufficiently grateful feelings, if, whilst receiving themeasures respecting their own interests, they cut away from the authorsof them all hopes of distinction? That it was not becoming the modestyof the Roman people to require that they themselves be eased from usury,and be put in possession of the land unjustly occupied by the great,whilst they leave those persons through whom they attained theseadvantages, become old tribunitians, not only without honour, but evenwithout the hope of honour. Wherefore they should first determine intheir minds what choice they would make, then declare that choice at thetribunitian elections. If they wished that the measures published bythem should be passed collectively, there was some reason forre-electing the same tribunes; for they would carry into effect whatthey published. But if they wished that only to be entertained which maybe necessary for each in private, there was no occasion for theinvidious continuation of honour; that they would neither have thetribuneship, nor the people those matters which were proposed."""Book 6,Chapter 40,"In reply to such peremptory language of the tribunes, when amazementat the insolence of their conduct and silence struck all the rest of thepatricians motionless, Appius Claudius Crassus, the grandson of thedecemvir, is said to have stepped forward to refute their arguments,[urged on] more by hatred and anger than by hope [of succeeding], and tohave spoken nearly to this effect: ""Romans, to me it would be neithernew nor surprising, if I too on the present occasion were to hear thatone charge, which has ever been advanced against our family by turbulenttribunes, that even from the beginning nothing in the state has been ofmore importance to the Claudian family than the dignity of thepatricians; that they have ever resisted the interests of the commons.Of which charges I neither deny nor object to the one, that we, since wehave been admitted into the state and the patricians, have strenuouslydone our utmost, that the dignity of those families, among which ye werepleased that we should be, might be truly said rather to have beenincreased than diminished. With respect to the other, in my own defenceand that of my ancestors, I would venture to maintain, Romans, (unlessany one may consider those things, which may be done for the generalgood of the state, were injurious to the commons as if inhabitants ofanother city,) that we, neither in our private nor in our officialcapacity, ever knowingly did any thing which was intended to bedetrimental to the commons; and that no act nor word of ours can bementioned with truth contrary to your interest (though some may havebeen contrary to your inclinations). Even though I were not of theClaudian family, nor descended from patrician blood, but an ordinaryindividual of the Roman citizens, who merely felt that I was descendedfrom free-born parents, and that I lived in a free state, could I besilent on this matter: that Lucius Sextius and Caius Licinius, perpetualtribunes, forsooth, have assumed such a stock of arrogance during thenine years in which they have reigned, as to refuse to allow you thefree exercise of your suffrage either at the elections or in enactinglaws. On a certain condition, one of them says, ye shall re-elect ustribunes for the tenth time. What else is it, but saying, what otherssue for, we disdain so thoroughly, that without some consideration wewill not accept it? But in the name of goodness, what is thatconsideration, for which we may always have you tribunes of the commons?that ye admit collectively all our measures, whether they please ordisplease, are profitable or unprofitable. I beg you, Tarquinii,tribunes of the commons, suppose that I, an individual citizen, shouldcall out in reply from the middle of the assembly, With your good leavebe it permitted us to select out of these measures those which we deemto be beneficial to us; to reject the others. It will not be permitted,he says. Must you enact concerning the interest of money and the lands,that which tends to the interest of you all; and must not this prodigytake place in the city of Rome, that of seeing Lucius Sextius and thisCaius Licinius consuls, a thing which you loathe and abominate? Eitheradmit all; or I propose none. Just as if any one were to place poisonand food together before any one who was oppressed with famine, andorder him either to abstain from that which would sustain life, or tomix with it that which would cause death. Wherefore, if this state werefree, would they not all in full assembly have replied to you, Begonehence with your tribuneships and your propositions? What? if you willnot propose that which it is the interest of the people to accept, willthere be no one who will propose it? If any patrician, if (what theydesire to be still more invidious) any Claudius should say, Eitheraccept all, or I propose nothing; which of you, Romans, would bear it?Will ye never look at facts rather than persons? but always listen withpartial ears to every thing which that officer will say, and withprejudiced ears to what may be said by any of us? But, by Jove, theirlanguage is by no means becoming members of a republic. What! what sortis the measure, which they are indignant at its having been rejected byyou? very like their language, Romans. I ask, he says, that it may notbe lawful for you to elect, as consuls, such persons as ye may wish.Does he require any thing else, who orders that one consul at least beelected from the commons; nor does he grant you the power of electingtwo patricians? If there were wars at the present day, such as theEtrurian for instance, when Porsenna took the Janiculum, such as theGallic war lately, when, except the Capitol and citadel, all theseplaces were in possession of the enemy; and should Lucius Sextius standcandidate for the consulate with Marcus Furius or any other of thepatricians: could ye endure that Sextius should be consul without anyrisk; that Camillus should run the risk of a repulse? Is this allowing acommunity of honours, that it should be lawful that two plebeians, andnot lawful that two patricians, be made consuls, and that it should benecessary that one be elected from among the commons, and lawful to passby both of the patricians? what fellowship, what confederacy is that? Isit not sufficient, if you come in for a share of that in which you hadno share hitherto, unless whilst suing for a part you seize on thewhole? I fear, he says, lest, if it be lawful that two patricians are tobe elected, ye will elect no plebeian. What else is this but saying,Because ye will not of your own choice elect unworthy persons, I willimpose on you the necessity of electing persons whom you do not wish?What follows, but that if one plebeian stand candidate with twopatricians, he owes no obligation to the people, and may say that he wasappointed by the law, not by suffrages?"Book 6,Chapter 41,"""How they may extort, not how they may sue for honours, is what theyseek: and they are anxious to attain the highest honour, so that theymay not owe the obligations incurred even for the lowest; and theyprefer to sue for honours rather through favourable conjunctures thanby merit. Is there any one who can feel it an affront to have himselfinspected and estimated; who thinks it reasonable that to himself alone,amidst struggling competitors, honours should be certain? who wouldwithdraw himself from your judgment? who would make your suffragesnecessary instead of voluntary; servile instead of free? I omit mentionof Licinius and Sextius, whose years of perpetuated power ye number, asthat of the kings in the Capitol; who is there this day in the state somean, to whom the road to the consulate is not rendered easier throughthe advantages of that law, than to us and to our children? inasmuch asyou will sometimes not be able to elect us even though you may wish it;those persons you must elect, even though you were unwilling. Of theinsult offered to merit enough has been said (for merit appertains tohuman beings); what shall I say respecting religion and the auspices,which is contempt and injustice relating exclusively to the immortalgods? Who is there who does not know that this city was built byauspices, that all things are conducted by auspices during war andpeace, at home and abroad? In whom therefore are the auspices vestedaccording to the usage of our forefathers? In the patricians, no doubt;for no plebeian magistrate is ever elected by auspices. So peculiar tous are the auspices, that not only do the people elect in no othermanner, save by auspices, the patrician magistrates whom they do elect,but even we ourselves, without the suffrages of the people, appoint theinterrex by auspices, and in our private station we hold those auspices,which they do not hold even in office. What else then does he do, thanabolish auspices out of the state, who, by creating plebeian consuls,takes them away from the patricians who alone can hold them? They maynow mock at religion. For what else is it, if the chickens do not feed?if they come out too slowly from the coop? if a bird chaunt anunfavourable note? These are trifling: but by not despising thesetrifling matters, our ancestors have raised this state to the highesteminence. Now, as if we had no need of the favour of the gods, weviolate all religious ceremonies. Wherefore let pontiffs, augurs, kingsof the sacrifices be appointed at random. Let us place the tiara ofJupiter's flamen on any person, provided he be a man. Let us hand overthe ancilia, the shrines, the gods, and the charge of the worship of thegods, to those to whom it is impious to commit them. Let not laws beenacted, nor magistrates elected under auspices. Let not the senate givetheir approbation, either to the assemblies of the centuries or of theCuri¾. Let Sextius and Licinius, like Romulus and Tatius, reign in thecity of Rome, because they give away as donations other persons' moneyand lands. So great is the charm of plundering the possessions of otherpersons: nor does it occur to you that by the one law vast wilds areproduced throughout the lands by expelling the proprietors from theirterritories; by the other credit is destroyed, along with which allhuman society ceases to exist. For every reason, I consider that thosepropositions ought to be rejected by you. Whatever ye may do, I pray thegods to render it successful."""Book 6,Chapter 42,"The speech of Appius merely had this effect, that the time forpassing the propositions was deferred. The same tribunes, Sextius andLicinius, being re-elected for the tenth time, succeeded in passing alaw, that of the decemvirs for religious matters, one half should beelected from the commons. Five patricians were elected, and five out ofthe plebeians; and by that step the way appeared opened to theconsulship. The commons, content with this victory, yielded to thepatricians, that, all mention of consuls being omitted for the present,military tribunes should be elected. Those elected were, Aulus andMarcus Cornelius a second time, Marcus Geganius, Publius Manlius, LuciusVeturius, and Publius Valerius a sixth time. When, except the siege ofVelitr¾, a matter rather of a slow than dubious result, there was nodisquiet from foreign concerns among the Romans; the sudden rumour of aGallic war being brought, influenced the state to appoint Marcus Furiusdictator for the fifth time. He named Titus Quinctius Pennus master ofthe horse. Claudius asserts that a battle was fought that year with theGauls, on the banks of the Anio; and that then the famous battle wasfought on the bridge, in which Titus Manlius, engaging with a Gaul bywhom he had been challenged, slew him in the sight of the two armies anddespoiled him of his chain. But I am induced by the authority of severalwriters to believe that those things happened not less than ten yearslater; but that in this year a pitched battle was fought with the Gaulsby the dictator, Marcus Furius, in the territory of Alba. The victorywas neither doubtful nor difficult to the Romans, though from therecollection of the former defeat the Gauls had diffused great terror.Many thousands of the barbarians were slain in the field, and greatnumbers in the storming of the camp. The rest dispersing, making chieflyfor Apulia, saved themselves from the enemy, both by continuing theirflight to a great distance, as also because panic and terror hadscattered them very widely. A triumph was decreed to the dictator withthe concurrence of the senate and commons. Scarcely had he as yetfinished the war, when a more violent disturbance awaited him at home;and by great struggles the dictator and the senate were overpowered, sothat the measures of the tribunes were admitted; and the elections ofthe consuls were held in spite of the resistance of the nobility, atwhich Lucius Sextius was made consul, the first of plebeian rank. Andnot even was that an end of the contests. Because the patricians refusedto give their approbation, the affair came very near a secession of thepeople, and other terrible threats of civil contests: when, however, thedissensions were accommodated on certain terms through the interferenceof the dictator; and concessions to the commons were made by thenobility regarding the plebeian consul; by the commons to the nobility,with respect to one pr¾tor to be elected out of the patricians, toadminister justice in the city. The different orders being at lengthrestored to concord after their long-continued animosity, when thesenate were of opinion that for the sake of the immortal gods they wouldreadily do a thing deserving, and that justly, if ever on any occasionbefore, that the most magnificent games should be performed, and thatone day should be added to the three; the plebeian ¾diles refusing theoffice, the young patricians cried out with one accord, that they, forthe purpose of paying honour to the immortal gods, would readilyundertake the task, so that they were appointed ¾diles. And when thankswere returned to them by all, a decree of the senate passed, that thedictator should ask of the people two persons as ¾diles from among thepatricians; that the senate should give their approbation to all theelections of that year."Book 7,Chapter 1,"This year will be remarkable for the consulship of a man of meanbirth, remarkable for two new magistracies, the pr¾torship and curule¾dileship. These honours the patricians claimed to themselves, inconsideration of one consulship having been conceded to the plebeians.The commons gave the consulship to Lucius Sextius, by whose law it hadbeen obtained. The patricians by their popular influence obtained thepr¾torship for Spurius Furius Camillus, the son of Marcus, the ¾dileshipfor Cneius Quinctius Capitolinus and Publius Cornelius Scipio, men oftheir own rank. To Lucius Sextius, the patrician colleague assigned wasLucius ®milius Mamercinus. In the beginning of the year mention was madeboth of the Gauls, who, after having strayed about through Apulia, itwas now rumoured were forming into a body; and also concerning a revoltof the Hernicians. When all business was purposely deferred, so thatnothing should be transacted through means of the plebeian consul,silence was observed on all matters, and a state of inaction like to ajustitium; except that, the tribunes not suffering it to pass unnoticedthat the nobility had arrogated to themselves three patricianmagistracies as a compensation for one plebeian consul, sitting incurule chairs, clad in the pr¾texta like consuls; the pr¾tor, too,administering justice, and as if colleague to the consuls, and electedunder the same auspices, the senate were in consequence made ashamed toorder the curule ¾diles to be elected from among the patricians. It wasat first agreed, that they should be elected from the commons everysecond year: afterwards the matter was left open. Then, in the consulateof Lucius Genucius and Quintus Servilius, affairs being tranquil both athome and abroad, that they might at no period be exempt from fear anddanger, a great pestilence arose. They say that a pr¾tor, a curule¾dile, and three plebeian tribunes died of it, and that several otherdeaths took place in proportion among the populace; and that pestilencewas made memorable chiefly by the death of Marcus Furius, which, thoughoccurring at an advanced age, was still much lamented. For he was atruly extraordinary man under every change of fortune; the first man inthe state in peace and war, before he went into exile; still moreillustrious in exile, whether by the regret felt for him by the state,which, when in captivity, implored his aid when absent; or by thesuccess with which, when restored to his country, he restored thatcountry along with himself. For five and twenty years afterwards (for somany years afterwards did he live) he uniformly preserved his claims tosuch great glory, and was deemed deserving of their considering him,next after Romulus, a second founder of the city of Rome."Book 7,Chapter 2,"The pestilence continued both for this and the following year, CaiusSulpicius Peticus and Caius Licinius Stolo being consuls. During thatyear nothing worth recording took place, except that for the purpose ofimploring the favour of the gods, there was a Lectisternium, the thirdtime since the building of the city. And when the violence of thedisease was alleviated neither by human measures nor by divineinterference, their minds being broken down by superstition, amongother means of appeasing the wrath of heaven, scenic plays also are saidto have been instituted, a new thing to a warlike people (for hithertothere had been only the shows of the circus). But the matter wastrivial, (as all beginnings generally are,) and even that itself from aforeign source. Without any poetry, or gesticulating in imitation ofsuch poetry, actors were sent for from Etruria, dancing to the measuresof a musician, and exhibited, according to the Tuscan fashion, movementsby no means ungraceful. The young men afterwards began to imitate these,throwing out at the same time among each other jocular expressions inuncouth verses; nor were their gestures irrelevant to their language.Wherefore the matter was received with approbation, and by frequent usewas much improved. To the native performers the name of _histriones_ wasgiven, because _hister_, in the Tuscan vocabulary, was the name of anactor, who did not, as formerly, throw out alternately artless andunpolished verses like the Fescennine at random, but represented medleyscomplete with metre, the music being regularly adjusted for themusician, and with appropriate gesticulation. Livius, who several yearsafter, giving up medleys, was the first who ventured to digest a storywith a regular plot, (the same being, forsooth, as all were at thattime, the actor of his own pieces,) after having broken his voice fromhaving been too repeatedly called on, and after having soughtpermission, is said to have placed a boy before the musician to chaunt,and to have performed the gesticulations with considerably freermovement, because the employment of his voice was no impediment to him.Thence commenced the practice of chaunting to the actors according totheir manual gesticulations, and the dialogues only were left to theirvoice. When by this arrangement the business of the scenic performanceswas called away from laughter and intemperate mirth, and the amusementbecame gradually converted into an art, the young men, leaving toregular actors the performance of plays, began themselves, according tothe ancient usage, to throw out ludicrous jests comprised in verses,which from that time were called _exodia_, and were collected chieflyfrom the Atellan farces. Which kind of amusement, received from theOsci, the young kept to themselves, nor did they suffer it to be debasedby regular players. Hence it remains an established usage that theactors of the Atellan farces are neither degraded from their tribe, andmay serve in the army, as if having no connexion with the profession ofthe stage. Among the trifling beginnings of other matters, it seemed tome that the first origin of plays also should be noticed; that it mightappear how from a moderate commencement it has reached its presentextravagance, scarcely to be supported by opulent kingdoms."Book 7,Chapter 3,"However, the first introduction of plays, intended as a religiousexpiation, neither relieved their minds from religious awe, nor theirbodies from disease. Nay more, when the circus being inundated by theoverflowing of the Tiber happened to interrupt the middle of theperformance, that indeed, as if the gods were now turned from them, anddespised their efforts to soothe their wrath, excited great terror.Accordingly, Cneius Genucius and Lucius ®milius Mamercinus being asecond time consuls, when the searching for expiations harassed theirminds, more than the diseases did their bodies, it is said to have beencollected from the memory of the more aged, that a pestilence hadformerly been relieved, on the nail being driven by a dictator. Inducedby this superstitious circumstance, the senate ordered a dictator to beappointed for the purpose of driving the nail. Lucius Manlius Imperiosusbeing appointed, named Lucius Pinarius master of the horse. There is anancient law written in antique letters and words, that whoever issupreme officer should drive a nail on the ides of September. It wasdriven into the right side of the temple of Jupiter supremely good andgreat, on that part where the temple of Minerva is. They say that thenail was a mark of the number of years elapsed, because letters wererare in those times, and that the law was referred to the temple ofMinerva, because number is the invention of that goddess. Cincius, acareful writer on such monuments, asserts that there were seen atVolsinii also nails fixed in the temple of Nortia, a Tuscan goddess, asindices of the number of years. Marcus Horatius, being consul, accordingto law dedicated the temple of Jupiter the best and greatest the yearafter the expulsion of kings; the solemnity of fixing the nail wasafterwards transferred from the consuls to the dictators, because theirswas a superior office. The custom being afterwards dropped, it seemed amatter of sufficient importance in itself, on account of which adictator should be appointed. For which reason Lucius Manlius beingappointed, just as if he had been appointed for the purpose of managingthe business of the state in general, and not to acquit it of areligious obligation, being ambitious to manage the Hernician war,harassed the youth by a severe levy, and at length, all the plebeiantribunes having risen up against him, whether overcome by force orshame, he resigned the dictatorship."Book 7,Chapter 4,"Notwithstanding this, in the commencement of the ensuing year,Quintus Servilius Ahala, Lucius Genucius being consuls, a day of trialis appointed for Manlius, by Marcus Pomponius, tribune of the commons.His severity in the levies, carried not only to the fining of thecitizens, but even to the laceration of their bodies, those who had notanswered to their names being some beaten with rods, others thrown intoprison, was hateful; and more hateful than all was his violent temper,and the surname of Imperiosus, offensive to a free state, adopted by himfrom an ostentation of severity, which he exercised not more againststrangers than his nearest friends, and even those of his own blood. Andamong other things, the tribune alleged as a charge against him that ""hehad banished his son, a youth convicted of no improper conduct, from thecity, home, household gods, forum, light, from the society of hisequals, and consigned him in a manner to a prison or workhouse; where ayouth of dictatorian rank, born of a very high family, should learn byhis daily suffering that he was descended of a truly imperious father.And for what offence? because he was not eloquent, nor ready indiscourse. Which defect of nature, whether ought it to be treated withleniency if there were a particle of humanity in him, or ought it to bepunished, and rendered more remarkable by harsh treatment? The dumbbeasts even, if any of their offspring happen to be badly formed, arenot the less careful in nourishing and cherishing them. But LuciusManlius aggravated the misfortune of his son by severity, and furtherclogged the slowness of his intellects; and if there were in him eventhe least spark of natural ability he extinguished it by a rustic lifeand a clownish education, and keeping him among cattle."""Book 7,Chapter 5,"By these charges the minds of all were exasperated against him morethan that of the young man himself: nay, on the contrary, being grievedthat he was even the cause of public odium and accusations to hisfather, that all the gods and men might know that he would rather affordaid to his father than to his enemies, he forms the design,characteristic of a rude and rustic mind no doubt, and though of aprecedent not conformable to the rules of civil life, yet commendablefor its filial piety. Having furnished himself with a knife, without theknowledge of any one he proceeds early in the morning into the city, andfrom the gate straightway to the house of Marcus Pomponius the tribune:he tells the porter, that he wanted to see his master immediately, andbid him to announce that he was Titus Manlius, son of Lucius. Beingintroduced immediately, (for he had hopes that the youth, incensedagainst his father, brought either some new charge, or some advice toaccomplish the project,) after mutual greeting, he says that there weresome matters which he wished to transact with him in private. Then, allpersons being ordered to withdraw to a distance, he draws his dagger;and standing over the couch with his dagger ready to strike, hethreatens that he would immediately stab him, unless he would swear inthe words which he would dictate, that ""he never would hold a meeting ofthe commons for the purpose of prosecuting his father."" The tribunealarmed, (for he saw the steel glittering before his eyes, himself aloneand unarmed; the other a young man, and very powerful, and what was noless terrifying, savagely ferocious in his bodily strength,) swears inthe terms in which he was obliged; and afterwards acknowledged thatforced by this proceeding he gave up his undertaking. Nor though thecommons would have preferred that an opportunity was afforded them ofpassing sentence on so cruel and tyrannical a culprit, they were notmuch displeased that the son had dared to act so in behalf of hisfather; and that was the more commendable in this, that such greatseverity on the part of the father had not weaned his mind from hisfilial affection. Wherefore the pleading of his cause was not onlydispensed with for the father, but the matter even became a source ofhonour to the young man; and when it had been determined on that yearfor the first time that tribunes of the soldiers for the legions shouldbe appointed by suffrage, (for before that the commanders themselvesused to appoint them, as they now do those whom they call Rufuli,) heobtained the second place among six, without any merit of a civil ormilitary nature to conciliate public favour; as he had spent his youthin the country and at a distance from all intercourse with the world."Book 7,Chapter 6,"On the same year the middle of the forum is said to have fallen in toan immense depth, forming a sort of vast cave, either by reason of anearthquake, or some other violent cause; nor could that gulf be filledup by throwing earth into it, every one exerting himself to the utmost,until by the admonition of the gods an inquiry began to be instituted,as to what constituted the chief strength of the Roman people? for thesoothsayers declare that must be devoted to that place, if they desiredthe Roman state to be perpetual. Then they tell us that Marcus Curtius,a youth distinguished in war, reproved them for hesitating, whetherthere was any greater Roman good than arms and valour. Silence beingmade, looking to the temples of the immortal gods, which command a viewof the forum, and towards the Capitol, and extending his hands at onetime towards heaven, at another towards the infernal gods, through thegaping aperture of the earth, he devoted himself: then, mounted on ahorse accoutred in the most gorgeous style possible, he plunged in fullarmour into the opening, and offerings and the fruits of the earth werethrown in over him by the multitude of men and women, and the lake wascalled Curtian not from Curtius Mettus, the ancient soldier of TitusTatius, but from this circumstance. If any way would lead one's inquiryto the truth, industry would not be wanting: now, when length of timeprecludes all certainty of evidence, we must stand by the rumour oftradition; and the name of the lake must be accounted for from this morerecent story. After due attention being paid to so great a prodigy, thesenate, during the same year, being consulted regarding the Hernicians,(after having sent heralds to demand restitution in vain,) voted, that amotion be submitted on the earliest day to the people on the subject ofdeclaring war against the Hernicians, and the people, in full assembly,ordered it. That province fell by lot to the consul Lucius Genucius. Thestate was in anxious suspense, because he was the first plebeian consulthat was about to conduct a war under his own auspices, being sure tojudge of the good or bad policy of establishing a community of honours,according as the matter should turn out. Chance so arranged it thatGenucius, marching against the enemy with a considerable force, fellinto an ambush; the legions being routed by reason of a sudden panic,the consul was slain after being surrounded by persons who knew not whomthey had slain. When this news was brought to Rome, the patricians, byno means so grieved for the public disaster, as elated at theunsuccessful guidance of the plebeian consul, every where exclaim, ""Theymight now go, and elect consuls from the commons, they might transferthe auspices where it was impious to do so. The patricians might by avote of the people be driven from their own exclusive honour: whetherhad this inauspicious law availed also against the immortal gods? Theyhad vindicated their authority, their auspices; which as soon as everthey were defiled by one by whom it was contrary to human and divine lawthat they should have been, the destruction of the army with its leaderwas a warning, that elections should hereafter be conducted in utterviolation of the rights of birth."" The senate-house and the forumresound with expressions such as these. Appius Claudius, because he haddissuaded the law, and now with greater authority blamed the issue of ameasure which had been found fault with by himself, the consul Serviliusappoints dictator by the general wish of the patricians, and a levy andcessation of business are procaimed."Book 7,Chapter 7,"Before the dictator and the new legions could arrive among theHernicians, matters were conducted with great success under thedirection of Caius Sulpicius the lieutenant-general, making use of afavourable opportunity. On the Hernicians, who after the death of theconsul came up contemptuously to the Roman camp with the certainty oftaking it, a sally was made by the exhortations of the consul, the mindsof the soldiers also being full of rage and indignation. The Hernicianswere much disappointed in their hopes of approaching the rampart; insuch complete confusion did they retire from thence. Then on the arrivalof the dictator the new army is joined to the old, the forces aredoubled; and the dictator in a public assembly, by bestowing praises onthe lieutenant-general and the soldiers by whose valour the camp hadbeen defended, at the same time raises the spirits of those who heardtheir own deserved praises, and at the same time stimulates the othersto rival such valour. With no less vigour are the military preparationsmade on the part of the enemy, who, mindful of the honour previouslyacquired, and not ignorant that the enemy had increased their strength,augment their forces also. The entire Hernician race, all of militaryage, are called out. Eight cohorts, each consisting of four hundred men,the chosen strength of their people, are levied. This, the select flowerof their youth, they filled with hope and courage by their havingdecreed that they should receive double pay. They were exempt also frommilitary work, that, being reserved for the single labour of fighting,they might feel that they should make exertions more than are made byordinary men. They are placed in an extraordinary position in the field,that their valour might be the more conspicuous. A plain two miles inbreadth separated the Roman camp from the Hernicians; in the middle ofthis, the spaces being about equal on both sides, they came to anengagement. At first the fight was kept up with doubtful hope; the Romancavalry having repeatedly essayed to no purpose to break the enemy'sline by their charge. When their fighting as cavalry was less marked bysuccess than by great efforts, the cavalry, having first consulted thedictator, and then obtained his permission, leaving their horses behind,rush forward in front of the line, with a loud shout, and recommence thebattle after a new style; nor could they be resisted, had not theextraordinary cohorts, possessing equal vigour both of body and spirit,thrown themselves in their way."Book 7,Chapter 8,"Then the contest is carried on between the leading men of the twostates. Whatever the common fortune of war carried off from either side,the loss was many times greater than can be estimated by the numbers:the rest, an armed populace, as if they had delegated the fight to theleading men, rest the issue of their own success on the bravery ofothers. Many fall on both sides; more are wounded. At length thehorsemen, chiding each other, asking, ""what now remained,"" if neitherwhen mounted they had made an impression on the enemy, nor as infantrydid they achieve any thing of moment; what third mode of fighting didthey wait for? Why had they so fiercely rushed forward before the line,and fought in a post not belonging to them? Aroused by these mutualchidings, they raise the shout anew, and press forward; and first theymade the enemy shrink, then made them give way, and at length fairlymade them turn their backs. Nor is it easy to say what circumstanceobtained the advantage against strength so well matched; except that theconstant fortune of both people might have raised or depressed theirspirits. The Romans pursued the Hernicians in their flight to theircamp; they refrained from attacking the camp, because it was late. Thefact of not having finished the sacrifices with success detained thedictator, so that he could not give the signal before noon, and hencethe contest was protracted till night. Next day the camp of theHernicians was deserted, and some wounded men were found left behind,and the main body of the fugitives was routed by the Signians, as theirstandards were seen passing by their walls but thinly attended, anddispersed over the country in precipitate flight. Nor was the victory anunbloody one to the Romans; a fourth part of the soldiers perished; and,where there was no less of loss, several Roman horsemen fell."Book 7,Chapter 9,"On the following year, when the consuls Caius Sulpicius and CaiusLicinius Calvus led an army against the Hernicians, and finding no enemyin the country took their city Ferentinum by storm, as they werereturning thence, the Tiburtians shut their gates against them. Thoughmany complaints had been made on both sides before this, this was thedetermining cause why war was declared against the Tiburtian people,restitution having been demanded through heralds. It is sufficientlyascertained that Titus Quinctius Pennus was dictator that year, and thatServius Cornelius Maluginensis was his master of the horse. MacerLicinius writes, that he was named by the consul for the purpose ofholding the elections, because his colleague hastening to have theelections over before undertaking the war, that he might continue theconsulship, he thought it right to thwart his ambitious designs. Thisbeing designed as a compliment to his own family, renders the authorityof Licinius of the less weight. As I find no mention of thatcircumstance in the more ancient annals, my mind inclines me to considerthat the dictator was appointed on account of the Gallic war. On thatyear, certainly, the Gauls pitched their camp at the third stone on theSalarian road, at the further side of the bridge of the Anio. Thedictator, after he had proclaimed a cessation of civil business onaccount of the Gallic tumult, bound all the younger citizens by themilitary oath; and having set forth from the city with a great army,pitched his camp on the hither bank of the Anio. The bridge lay betweenboth armies, neither side attempting to break it down, lest it should bean indication of fear. There were frequent skirmishes for the possessionof the bridge; nor could it be clearly determined who were masters ofit, the superiority being so indecisive. A Gaul of very large statureadvanced on the bridge, then unoccupied, and says with as loud a voiceas he could exert, ""Let the bravest man that Rome now possesses comeforward here to battle, that the event of an engagement between us bothmay show which nation is superior in war."""Book 7,Chapter 10,"There was for a long time silence among the young Roman nobility, asthey were both ashamed to decline the contest, and unwilling to claimthe principal post of danger. Then Titus Manlius, son of Lucius, thesame who had freed his father from the vexatious persecution of thetribune, proceeds from his station to the dictator: ""Without yourcommands, general, I would never fight out of the ordinary course, notthough I should see certain victory before me. If you permit me, I wishto show that brute, who insolently makes such a parade before theenemy's line, that I am sprung from that family which dislodged a bodyof Gauls from the Tarpeian rock."" Then the dictator says, ""TitusManlius, may you prosper for your valour and dutiful affection to yourfather and your country. Go on, and make good the invincibility of theRoman name with the aid of the gods."" His companions then arm the youth;he takes a footman's shield, girds himself with a Spanish sword, fit fora close fight. When armed and equipped, they lead him out against theGaul, who exhibited stolid exultation, and (for the ancients thoughtthat also worthy of mention) thrust out his tongue in derision. Theythen retire to their station; and the two being armed, are left in themiddle space, more after the manner of a spectacle, than according tothe law of combat, by no means well matched, according to those whojudged by sight and appearance. The one had a body enormous in size,glittering in a vest of various colours, and in armour painted andinlaid with gold; the other had a middle stature, as is seen amongsoldiers, and a mien unostentatious, in arms fit for ready use ratherthan adapted for show. He had no song, no capering, nor idle flourishingof arms, but his breast, teeming with courage and silent rage, hadreserved all its ferocity for the decision of the contest. When theytook their stand between the two armies, the minds of so manyindividuals around them suspended between hope and fear, the Gaul, likea huge mass threatening to fall on that which was beneath it, stretchingforward his shield with his left hand, discharged an ineffectual cut ofhis sword with a great noise on the armour of his foe as he advancedtowards him. The Roman, raising the point of his sword, after he hadpushed aside the lower part of the enemy's shield with his own, andclosing on him so as to be exempt from the danger of a wound, insinuatedhimself with his entire body between the body and arms of the foe, withone and immediately with another thrust pierced his belly and groin, andstretched his enemy now prostrate over a vast extent of ground. Withoutoffering the body of the prostrate foe any other indignity, he despoiledit of one chain; which, though smeared with blood, he threw around hisneck. Dismay with astonishment now held the Gauls motionless. TheRomans, elated with joy, advancing from their post to meet theirchampion, with congratulations and praises conduct him to the dictator.Among them uttering some uncouth jests in military fashion somewhatresembling verses, the name of Torquatus was heard: this name, beingkept up, became afterwards an honour to the descendants even of thefamily. The dictator added a present of a golden crown, and before apublic assembly extolled that action with the highest praises."Book 7,Chapter 11,"And, indeed, of so great moment was the contest with respect to theissue of the war in general, that on the night following the army of theGauls, having abandoned their camp in confusion, passed over into theterritory of Tibur, and from thence soon after into Campania, havingconcluded an alliance for the purpose of war, and being abundantlysupplied with provision by the Tiburtians. That was the reason why, onthe next year, Caius P¾telius Balbus, consul, though the province of theHernicians had fallen to the lot of his colleague, Marcus FabiusAmbustus, led an army, by order of the people, against the Tiburtians.To whose assistance when the Gauls came back from Campania, dreadfuldevastations were committed in the Lavican, Tusculan, and Albanterritories. And though the state was satisfied with a consul as leaderagainst the Tiburtian enemy, the alarm created by the Gauls rendered itnecessary that a dictator should be appointed. Quintus Servilius Ahalahaving been appointed, named Titus Quinctius master of the horse; andwith the sanction of the senate, vowed the great games, should that warturn out successfully. The dictator then, having ordered the consulararmy to remain to confine the Tiburtians to their own war, bound all theyounger citizens by the military oath, none declining the service. Abattle was fought not far from the Colline gate with the strength of theentire city, in the sight of their parents, wives, and children: whichbeing great incitements to courage, even when these relatives areabsent, being now placed before their eyes, fired the soldiers at oncewith feelings of shame and compassion. Great havoc being made on bothsides, the Gallic army is at length worsted. In their flight they makefor Tibur, as being the main stay of the war; and being interceptedwhilst straggling by the consul P¾telius not far from Tibur, and theTiburtians having come out to bring them aid, they are with the latterdriven within the gates. Matters were managed with distinguished successboth by the dictator and the consul. And the other consul, Fabius, atfirst in slight skirmishes, and at length in one single battle, defeatedthe Hernicians, when they attacked him with all their forces. Thedictator, after passing the highest encomiums on the consuls in thesenate and before the people, and yielding up the honour of his ownexploits to them, resigned his dictatorship. P¾telius enjoyed a doubletriumph, over the Gauls and the Tiburtians. Fabius was satisfied withentering the city in ovation. The Tiburtians derided the triumph ofP¾telius; ""for where,"" they said, ""had he encountered them in the field?that a few of their people having gone outside the gates to witness theflight and confusion of the Gauls, on seeing an attack made onthemselves, and that those who came in the way were slaughtered withoutdistinction, had retired within the city. Did that seem to the Romansworthy of a triumph? They should not consider it an extraordinary andwondrous feat to raise a tumult at the enemy's gates, as they shouldsoon see greater confusion before their own walls."""Book 7,Chapter 12,"Accordingly in the year following, Marcus Popilius L¾nas and CneiusManlius being consuls, during the first silence of the night having setout from Tibur with an army prepared for action, they came to the cityof Rome. The suddenness of the thing, and the panic occurring at night,occasioned some terror among them on being suddenly aroused from sleep;further, the ignorance of many as to who the enemy were or whence theyhad come. However they quickly ran to arms, and guards were posted atthe gates, and the walls were secured with troops; and when daylightshowed but an inconsiderable force before the walls, and that the enemywere none other than the Tiburtines, the consuls, having gone forth fromthe two gates, attack on either side the army of these now advancing upto the walls; and it became obvious that they had come relying rather onthe opportunity than on their valour, for they hardly sustained thefirst charge of the Romans. Nay more, it was evident that their comingproved an advantage to the Romans, and that a disturbance just arisingbetween the patricians and commons was checked by the dread of a war sonear them. In the next war there was another irruption of the enemy,more terrible to the country than to the city. The Tarquinians overranthe Roman frontiers, committing depredations on that side moreespecially where they are contiguous to Etruria; and restitution beingdemanded in vain, the new consuls, Cneius Fabius and Caius Plautius,proclaimed war on them by order of the people; and that province fell tothe lot of Fabius, the Hernicians to Plautius. A rumour of a Gallic waralso was gaining ground. But amid their many terrors, they had someconsolation from a peace granted to the Latins at their own request, asalso from a considerable reinforcement of soldiers received from them inconformity with an old treaty, which, they had for several years ceasedto observe. When the Roman cause was supported by this aid, the tidingsthat the Gauls had come to Pr¾neste and were encamped near to Pedum,were less heeded. It was determined that Caius Sulpicius should beappointed dictator. Caius Plautius the consul, being sent for for thepurpose, nominated him; Marcus Valerius was assigned as master of thehorse to the dictator. These having selected the best of the soldiersout of the two consular armies, led them against the Gauls. This war wasmore tedious than was satisfactory to either party. When at first theGauls only were desirous of fighting, afterwards the Roman soldiersconsiderably surpassed the ferocity of the Gauls in their ardour forarms and battle; it by no means met the approbation of the dictator whenno urgent necessity existed to run any hazard against an enemy, whosestrength time and inconvenient situation would daily impair, in totalinactivity, without provisions previously laid up or any fortifiedsituation; besides, being persons of such minds and bodies, that alltheir force lay in brisk exertion, whilst the same flagged by shortdelay. On these considerations the dictator protracted the war, anddenounced a severe penalty against any one who should fight against theenemy without orders. The soldiers, being much dissatisfied with this,first censured the dictator, in their conversation, when on guard and onthe watches; sometimes they found fault with the patricians in general,for not having commanded the war to be conducted by the consuls. ""Thatan excellent general, an extraordinary commander, had been selected, whothinks that whilst he does nothing victory will fly down from heaveninto his lap."" Afterwards they gave expression to these same sentimentsopenly during the day, and to others still more outrageous; that ""theywould either fight without the general's orders, or would proceed in abody to Rome."" The centurions, too, began to mix with the soldiers; andthey murmured not only in their own quarters, but now their observationsbegan to be confounded together at head-quarters and at the general'stent, and the crowd increased to the magnitude of an assembly, and theynow shouted from all quarters that ""they should go forthwith to thedictator; that Sextus Tullius should speak in behalf of the army, so asbecame his courage."""Book 7,Chapter 13,"Tullius was now for the seventh time first centurion of a legion,nor was there in the army, at least among those who served in theinfantry, a man more distinguished by his conduct. He, at the head of abody of the soldiers, proceeds to the tribunal, and to Sulpicius, notmore surprised at the crowd than at Tullius, the leader of the crowd, asoldier most obedient to command, he says: ""Dictator, the whole army,conceiving that they have been condemned by you of cowardice, and keptwithout their arms by way of disgrace, has entreated me to plead theircause before you. In truth, if having deserted our post any where, ifturning our backs to the enemy, if the disgraceful loss of ourstandards could be laid to our charge, I would still think it but justthat we should obtain this from you, that you would suffer us to redeemour fault by our bravery, and to blot out the memory of our disgrace bynewly acquired glory. Even the legions defeated at the Allia, when theyafterwards set out from Veii, recovered by their valour the same countrywhich they had lost through a panic. We, by the bounty of the gods, yourgood fortune, and that of the Roman people, have both our cause and ourglory uninjured. Though of glory I would scarcely venture to say anything; since both the enemy scoff at us with every kind of insult, aswomen hiding ourselves behind a rampart; and you, our general, what wegrieve at still more, judge your army to be without spirit, withoutarms, without hands; and before you had made trial of us, you have sodespaired of us, as to consider yourself to be the leader of a set ofmaimed and disabled men. For what else shall we believe to be the reasonwhy you, a veteran general, most valiant in war, sit down with handsfolded, as they say. But however it may be, it is fitter that you shouldseem to doubt of our courage than we of yours. If however this plan ofproceeding be not your own, but a public one, if some concerted schemeof the patricians, and not the Gallic war, keeps us exiled from thecity, from our homes, I beg that you consider what I may say here, asaddressed not by soldiers to their general, but to the patricians by thecommons, who tell you that as ye have your separate plans, so will theyhave theirs. Who in the name of goodness can be angry that we (considerourselves) your soldiers, not your slaves? as men who have been sent towar, not into exile? as men who, if any one give the signal, and leadthem out into the field, will fight as becomes men and Romans? as menwho, if there be no need of arms, would spend their idle time in Romerather than in a camp? Consider these observations as addressed to thepatricians. As your soldiers, we entreat you, general, to afford us anopportunity of fighting. We both desire to conquer, and also to conquerwith you for our leader; to confer on you the distinguished laurel, withyou to enter the city in triumph; following your car withcongratulations and rejoicings, to approach the temple of Jupitersupremely great and good."" The entreaties of the multitude followed thespeech of Tullius; and from every side they cried out, that he wouldgive the signal, that he would order them to take arms."Book 7,Chapter 14,"The dictator, though he saw that a good result was brought about bya precedent not to be approved of, yet took on himself to do what thesoldiers wished, and inquires of Tullius privately, what the nature ofthis transaction was, or on what precedent it was done? Tulliusearnestly entreated the dictator ""not to believe him forgetful ofmilitary discipline, of himself, nor of the respect due to his general;that he had not declined to put himself at the head of the excitedmultitude, who generally were like to their instigators, lest any otherperson might step forward, such an excited multitude were wont to elect.That for his own part he would do nothing without the orders of hisgeneral; that he also however must carefully see, that he keep the armyin obedience. That minds so excited could not be put off: that theywould choose for themselves time and place, if they were not granted bythe general."" While they are conversing in this way, it so happened,that as a Gaul was driving away some cattle feeding on the outside ofthe rampart two Roman soldiers took them from him. Stones were thrown atthem by the Gauls, then a shout was raised at the next Roman post, andseveral ran forward on both sides. And now matters were not far from aregular engagement, had not the contest been quickly stopped by thecenturions. By this event the testimony of Tullius was certainlyconfirmed with the dictator; and the matter not admitting of furtherdelay, a proclamation is issued that they were to fight on the dayfollowing. The dictator however, as one who went into the field relyingmore on the courage of his men than on their numerical strength, beganto look about and consider how he might by some artifice strike terrorinto the enemy. With a sagacious mind he devises a new project, whichmany generals both of our own and of foreign countries have sinceadopted, some indeed in our own times. He orders the panniers to betaken from the mules, and two side-cloths only being left, he mounts themuleteers on them, equipped with arms partly belonging to the prisoners,and some to the sick. About a thousand of these being equipped, he mixeswith them one hundred horsemen, and orders them to go up during thenight into the mountains over the camp and to conceal themselves in thewoods, and not to stir from thence, till they should receive a signalfrom him. As soon as day dawned, he himself began to extend his linealong the bottom of the mountain, for the express purpose that the enemyshould face the mountains. The measures for infusing groundless terrorbeing now completed, which terror indeed proved almost more serviceablethan real strength, the leaders of the Gauls first believed that theRomans would not come down to the plain: then when they saw them beginon a sudden to descend, they also, on their part eager for the fight,rush forward to the encounter; and the battle commenced before thesignal could be given by the leaders."Book 7,Chapter 15,"The Gauls attacked the right wing with greater fierceness, nor couldthey have been withstood, had not the dictator happened to be on thespot, rebuking Sextus Tullius by name, and asking him, ""Was it in thisway he had engaged that the soldiers would fight? Where now were theshouts of those demanding their arms? where the threats that they wouldcommence the fight without the orders of their general? Behold thegeneral himself calling them with a loud voice to battle, and advancingin arms before the front of the line. Would any of those now follow him,who were just now to have led the way; fierce in the camp, but cowardsin the field?"" What they heard was all true; wherefore shame appliedsuch strong incentives, that they rushed upon the weapons of the enemy,their attention being turned away from the thought of danger. Thisonset, which was almost frantic at first, threw the enemy into disorder;then the cavalry charging them whilst thus disordered, made them turntheir backs. The dictator himself, when he saw their line wavering inone direction, carries round some troops to the left wing, where he sawa crowd of the enemy collected, and gave to those who were on themountain the signal which had been agreed on. When a new shout arosefrom that quarter also, and they seemed to make their way in an obliquedirection, down the mountain to the camp of the Gauls; then through fearlest they should be cut off from it, the fight was given up, and theywere carried towards the camp with precipitate speed. Where when MarcusValerius, master of the horse, who, after having routed their left wing,was riding towards the enemies' entrenchment, met them, they turn theirflight to the mountains and woods: and the greater part of them werethere intercepted by the fallacious show of horsemen, and the muleteers,and of those whom panic had carried into the woods, a dreadful slaughtertook place after the battle was ended. Nor did any one since Camillusobtain a more complete triumph over the Gauls than Caius Sulpicius. Aconsiderable weight of gold taken from the Gallic spoils, which heenclosed in hewn stone, he consecrated in the Capitol. The same year theconsuls also were engaged in fighting with various success. For theHernicians were vanquished and subdued by Cneius Plautius. His colleagueFabius fought against the Tarquinians without caution or prudence; norwas the loss sustained in the field so much [a subject of regret] asthat the Tarquinians put to death three hundred and seven Romansoldiers, their prisoners, by which barbarous mode of punishment thedisgrace of the Roman people was rendered considerably more remarkable.To this disaster moreover was added, the laying waste of the Romanterritory, which the Privernatians, and afterwards the people ofVelitr¾, committed by a sudden incursion. The same year two tribes, thePomptine and Publilian, were added. The votive games, which MarcusFurius in his dictatorship had vowed, were performed; and a propositionwas then for the first time made to the people regarding bribery atelections by Caius P¾tilius, tribune of the commons, with theapprobation of the senate; and by that bill they thought that theambition of new men in particular, who had been accustomed to go aroundthe markets and places of meeting, was checked."Book 7,Chapter 16,"Not equally pleasing to the patricians on the following year was alaw passed in the consulship of Caius Marcius and Cneius Manlius, byMarcus Duilius and Lucius M¾nius, tribunes of the commons, regarding theinterest of money at twelve per cent., and the people received andpassed it with much more eagerness. In addition to the new warsdetermined on the preceding year, a new enemy arose in the Faliscians,in consequence of a double charge; both that their youth had taken uparms in conjunction with the Tarquinians, and because they had refusedto restore to the demand of the Roman heralds those who had fled toFalerii, after the unsuccessful battle. That province fell to the lot ofCneius Manlius, Marcius led the army into the Privernatian territory,which, from the long continuance of peace, was in a flourishingcondition; and he enriched the soldiers with abundance of spoil. To thegreat quantity of effects he added an act of munificence; for, bysetting aside nothing for public use, he favoured the soldier in hisendeavours to accumulate private property. When the Privernatians hadtaken their post in a well-fortified camp under their own walls, havingsummoned the soldiers to an assembly, he says to them, ""I now give toyou the camp and city of the enemy for plunder, if you promise me thatyou will exert yourselves bravely in the field, and that you are notbetter prepared for plunder than for fighting."" With loud shouts theycall for the signal, and elated and buoyed up with certain confidence,they proceed to the battle. Then, in front of the line, Sextus Tullius,whom we have already mentioned, exclaims, ""Behold, general,"" says he,""how your army are performing their promises to you;"" and laying asidehis javelin, he attacks the enemy sword in hand. The whole van followTullius, and at the first onset put the enemy to flight; then pursuingthem, when routed, to the town, when they were just applying the scalingladders to the walls, they received the city on a surrender. A triumphwas had over the Privernatians. Nothing worth mentioning was achieved bythe other consul, except that he, by an unusual precedent, holding anassembly of the tribes in the camp at Sutrium, he passed a law regardingthe twentieth part of the value of those set free by manumission. As bythis law no small revenue was added to the treasury, now low, the senategave it their sanction. But the tribunes of the commons, influenced notso much by the law as by the precedent, passed a law, making it acapital offence for any one in future to summon an assembly of thepeople at a distance from the city; for if that were allowed, there wasnothing, no matter how destructive to the people, that might not he doneby soldiers, who had sworn allegiance to their consul. The same yearCaius Licinius Stolo was condemned in a fine of ten thousand _asses_, onhis own law, by Marcus Popillius L¾nas, because he possessed inconjunction with his son a thousand acres of land, and because he hadattempted to evade the law by emancipating his son."Book 7,Chapter 17,"The next two consuls, Marcus Fabius Ambustus a second time, andMarcus Popillius L¾nas a second time, had two wars on their hands. Theone with the Tiburtians was easy, which Licinius managed, who drove theenemy into their city, and laid waste their lands. The Faliscians andTarquinians routed the other consul in the commencement of the fight.From these parties the utmost terror was raised, in consequence of theirpriests, who, by carrying before them lighted torches and the figures ofserpents, and advancing with the gait of furies, disconcerted the Romansoldiers by their extraordinary appearance; and then indeed they ranback to their entrenchments, in all the hurry of trepidation, as iffrenzied or thunderstruck; and then when the consul, andlieutenant-generals, and tribunes began to ridicule and chide them forbeing frightened like children at mere sights, shame suddenly changedtheir minds; and they rushed, as if blindfold, on those very objectsfrom which they had fled. Having, therefore, dissipated the idlecontrivance of the enemy, having attacked those who were in arms, theydrove their whole line before them, and having got possession of thecamp also on that day, and obtained great booty, they returnedvictorious, uttering military jests, both on the stratagem of the enemyas also on their own panic. Then the whole Etruscan nation is aroused,and under the conduct of the Tarquinians and Faliscians, they come toSalin¾. To meet this alarm, Caius Marcius Rutilus, being appointeddictator, the first plebeian who was so, named Caius Plautius, also aplebeian, master of the horse. This was deemed an indignity by thepatricians, that the dictatorship also was now become common, and withall their exertions they prevented any thing from either being decreedor prepared for the dictator, for the prosecution of that war. With themore promptitude, on that account, did the people order things, asproposed by the dictator. Having set out from the city, along both sidesof the Tiber, and transporting his army on rafts whithersoever hisintelligence of the enemy led him, he surprised many of them stragglingabout in scattered parties, laying waste the lands. Moreover, hesuddenly attacked their camp and took it; and eight thousand of theenemy being made prisoners, all the rest being either slain or drivenout of the Roman territory, he triumphed by order of the people, withoutthe sanction of the senate. Because they neither wished that theconsular elections should be held by a plebeian dictator or consul, andthe other consul, Fabius, was detained by the war, matters came to aninterregnum. There were then interreges in succession, QuintusServilius Ahala, Marcus Fabius, Cneius Manlius, Caius Fabius, CaiusSulpicius, Lucius ®milius, Quintus Servilius, Marcus Fabius Ambustas. Inthe second interregnum a dispute arose, because two patrician consulswere elected: and the tribunes protesting, Fabius the interrex said,that ""it was a law in the twelve tables, that whatever the peopleordered last should be law and in force; that the suffrages of thepeople were their orders."" When the tribunes by their protest had beenable to effect nothing else than to put off the elections, twopatricians were chosen consuls, Caius Sulpicius Peticus a third time,Marcus Valerius Publicola; and on the same day they entered into office."Book 7,Chapter 18,"On the four hundredth year after the building of the city of Rome,and the thirty-fifth after its recovery from the Gauls, the consulshipbeing taken away from the commons after eleven years, consuls, bothpatricians, entered into office after the interregnum, Caius SulpiciusPeticus a third time, and Marcus Valerius Publicola. During this yearEmpulum was taken from the Tiburtians with a struggle not worthmentioning; whether the war was waged there under the auspices of thetwo consuls, as some have stated; or whether the lands of theTarquinians were laid waste by the consul Sulpicius about the same timethat Valerius led the troops against the Tiburtians. The consuls had amore arduous contest at home with the commons and tribunes. As twopatricians had received the consulship, they considered that not onlytheir resolution, but their honour also, was involved in theirconsigning it to two patricians. For if the consulship were made aplebeian magistracy, they must either yield it up entirely, or possessit entire, which possession they had received from their fathersunimpaired. The commons on the other hand loudly remonstrate; ""Why didthey live; why were they reckoned in the number of citizens; if theycollectively cannot maintain that which was acquired by the firmness oftwo men, Lucius Sextius and Caius Licinius? That either kings, ordecemvirs, or, if there be any denomination of power more offensive,would be submitted to rather than see both the consuls patricians, orrather than not obey and rule in turn; but the one half, located inperpetual power, thinks the commons born for no other purpose than to besubservient."" The tribunes are not remiss in encouraging thedisturbances; but amid the excited state of all scarcely any aredistinguished as leaders. When they had several times gone down to theCampus Martius to no purpose, and when many days of meeting had beenspent in seditious movements; at length the resentment of the commons,overcome by the perseverance of the consuls, broke out to such a degree,that the commons followed in sorrow the tribunes, exclaiming, that therewas an end of liberty; that not only the Campus should be relinquished,but the city also as being held captive and oppressed by the tyranny ofthe patricians. The consuls, deserted by a part of the people, finishthe election nevertheless with the small number [who attended]. Both theconsuls elected were patricians, Marcus Fabius Ambustus a third time,Titus Quinctius. In some annals I find Marcus Popilius mentioned asconsul instead of Titus Quinctius."Book 7,Chapter 19,"Two wars were conducted with success on that year: and they forcedthe Tiburtians by force of arms to a surrender. The city of Sassula wastaken from them; and the other towns would have shared the same fate,had not the entire nation laid down their arms, and put themselves underthe protection of the consul. A triumph was obtained by him over theTiburtians: in other respects the victory was a mild one. Rigorousseverity was practised against the Tarquinians. A great many beingslaughtered in the field, out of a great number of prisoners threehundred and fifty-eight were selected, all of the highest rank, to besent to Rome; the rest of the multitude were put to the sword. Nor werethe people more merciful towards those who had been sent to Rome. Theywere all beaten with rods and beheaded in the middle of the forum. Thatwas the punishment retaliated on the enemy for their butchering theRomans in the forum of Tarquinii. The successes in war induced theSamnites to seek their friendship. A courteous answer was returned totheir ambassadors by the senate: they were received into an alliance bya treaty. The Roman commons had not the same success at home as in war.For though the burden of interest money had been relieved by fixing therate at one to the hundred, the poor were overwhelmed by the principalalone, and submitted to confinement. On this account, the commons tooklittle heed either of the two consuls being patricians, or themanagement of the elections, by reason of their private distresses.Both consulships therefore remained with the patricians. The consulsappointed were Caius Sulpicius P¾ticus a fourth time, Marcus ValeriusPublicola a second time. Whilst the state was occupied with the Etrurianwar, [entered into] because a report prevailed that the people of C¾rehad joined the Tarquinians through compassion for them from theirrelationship, ambassadors from the Latins drew their attention to theVolscians, bringing tidings that an army enlisted and fully armed wasnow on the point of attacking their frontiers; from thence that theywere to enter the Roman territory in order to commit depredations. Thesenate therefore determined that neither affair should be neglected;they ordered that troops should be raised for both purposes, and thatthe consuls should cast lots for the provinces. The greater share oftheir anxiety afterwards inclined to the Etrurian war; after it wasascertained, from a letter of the consul Sulpicius, to whom the provinceof Tarquinii had fallen, that the land around the Roman Salin¾ had beendepopulated, and that part of the plunder had been carried away into thecountry of the people of C¾re, and that the young men of that peoplewere certainly among the depredators. The senate therefore, havingrecalled the consul Valerius, who was opposed to the Volscians, and whohad his camp on the frontiers of Tusculum, ordered him to nominate adictator. He nominated Titus Manlius, son of Lucius. He, after he hadappointed Aulus Cornelius Cossus his master of the horse, content withthe consular army, declared war against the C¾ritians by order of thepeople, with the sanction of the senate."Book 7,Chapter 20,"Then for the first time were the C¾ritians seized with a real dreadof war, as if there was greater power in the words of the enemy toindicate war than in their own acts, who had provoked the Romans bydevastation; and they perceived how ill suited the contest was to theirstrength. They repented of their depredations, and cursed theTarquinians as the instigators of the revolt. Nor did any one think ofpreparing arms and hostilities; but each strenuously urged the necessityof sending ambassadors to sue for pardon for their error. When theirambassadors applied to the senate, being referred by the senate to thepeople, they implored the gods, whose sacred utensils they had receivedin the Gallic war and treated with all due ceremony, that the samecompassion for them might influence the Romans now in a flourishingcondition, which had formerly influenced themselves when the state ofthe Roman people was distressed; and turning to the temple of Vesta,they invoked the bonds of hospitality subsisting [between themselves]and the flamens and vestals entered into by them with holy and religiouszeal: ""Would any one believe that persons, who possessed such merits,had suddenly become enemies without cause? or if they had committed anyact in a hostile manner, that they had, through design rather than underthe influence of error from frenzy, so acted, as to cancel their formeracts of kindness by recent injuries, more especially when conferred onpersons so grateful, and that they would choose to themselves as enemiesthe Roman people, now in the most flourishing state and most successfulin war, whose friendship they had cultivated when they were distressed?That they should not call it design, which should rather be called forceand necessity. That the Tarquinians, passing through their territorywith a hostile army, after they had asked for nothing but a passage,forced with them some of their peasants, to accompany them in thatdepredation, which was charged on them as a crime. That they wereprepared to deliver them up, if it pleased them that they should bedelivered up; or that they should be subjected to punishment, if [theydesired] that they should be punished. That C¾re, the sanctuary of theRoman people, the harbourer of its priests, the receptacle of the sacredutensils of Rome, they should suffer to escape, in regard to the ties ofhospitality contracted with the vestals, and in regard to the religiousdevotion paid to their gods, intact and unstained with the charge ofhostilities committed."" The people were influenced not so much by [themerits of] the present case, as by their former deserts, so as to beunmindful rather of the injury than of the kindness. Peace was thereforegranted to the people of C¾re, and it was resolved that the making of atruce for one hundred years should be referred to a decree of thesenate. Against the Faliscians, implicated in the same charge, the forceof the war was turned; but the enemy was no where found. Though theirterritories were visited in all directions with devastation, theyrefrained from besieging the towns; and the legions being brought backto Rome, the remainder of the year was spent in repairing the walls andthe towers, and the temple of Apollo was dedicated."Book 7,Chapter 21,"At the close of the year a dispute between the patricians andcommons suspended the consular elections, the tribunes refusing to allowthe elections to be held, unless they were held conformably to theLicinian law; the dictator being determined to do away with theconsulate altogether from the state, rather than to make it common tothe patricians and the commons. Accordingly when, the elections beingrepeatedly adjourned, the dictator resigned his office, matters came toan interregnum. Upon this, when the interreges found the commonsincensed against the fathers, the contest was carried on by variousdisturbances to the eleventh interrex. The tribunes held out as theirplea, the protection of the Licinian law. The people had the painfulsense of the increasing weight of interest nearer to their hearts; andtheir private troubles became predominant amid the public contests.Through the wearisome effects of which the patricians ordered LuciusCornelius Scipio, the interrex, for peace' sake to observe the Licinianlaw in the election of consuls. To Publius Valerius Publicola, CaiusMarcius Rutilus, a plebeian, was assigned as a colleague. Once theirminds were disposed to concord, the new consuls, setting about torelieve the affair of the interest money also, which seemed to preventperfect unanimity, made the payment of the debts a matter of publicconcern, five commissioners having been appointed, whom from theirmanagement of the money they called bankers. By their justice anddiligence they deserved to have their names signalized by the records ofevery history. They were Caius Duilius, Publius Decius Mus, MarcusPapirius, Quintus Publilius, and Titus ®milius; who underwent a taskmost difficult to be managed, and dissatisfactory in general to bothparties, certainly always so to one, both with moderation in otherrespects, as well as at the public expense, rather than with any loss[to the creditors]. For the tardy debts and those which were moretroublesome, rather by the inertness of the debtors than by want ofmeans, either the treasury paid off, tables with money being placed inthe forum, in such a manner that the public was first secured; or avaluation, at equitable prices, of their property freed them; so thatnot only without injury, but even without complaints on either side, animmense amount of debt was cleared off. After this a groundless alarm ofan Etrurian war, as there was a report that the twelve states hadconspired, rendered it necessary that a dictator should be appointed.Caius Julius was nominated in the camp, (for the decree of the senatewas sent thither to the consuls,) to whom Lucius ®milius was attached asmaster of the horse. But all things were quiet abroad."Book 7,Chapter 22,"An attempt made at home by the dictator, to have the election of twopatrician consuls, brought the government to an interregnum. The twointerreges, Caius Sulpicius and Marcus Fabius, succeeded in that whichthe dictator had in vain attempted, scil. in having both the consulselected from the patricians, the people being rather more appeased inconsequence of the service done them in lightening their debts. Thepersons elected were, Caius Sulpicius Peticus himself, who firstresigned the office of interrex, and Titus Quinctius Pennus. Some attachthe name of K¾so, others that of Caius to Quinctius. They both set outto the war, Quinctius to the Faliscian, Sulpicius to the Tarquinian; andthe enemy no where meeting them in the field, they waged war moreagainst the lands than the men, by burning and laying waste every thing,by the debilitating effects of which, as of a slow consumption, thepertinacity of both states was so broken, that they solicited a truce,first from the consuls, then through their permission from the senate.They obtained a truce for forty years. Thus the concern regarding thetwo wars which were hanging over them being laid aside, whilst there wassome repose from arms, it was determined that a census should beinstituted, because the payment of the debt had changed the owners ofmuch property. But when the assembly was proclaimed for the appointmentof censors, Caius Marcius Rutilus, who had been the first plebeiandictator, having declared himself a candidate for the censorship,disturbed the harmony of the different orders. This step he seemed tohave taken at an unseasonable time; because both the consuls thenhappened to be patricians, who declared that they would take no accountof him. But he both succeeded in his undertaking by his ownperseverance, and the tribunes aided him by recovering a right lost inthe election of the consuls; and both the worth of the man brought himto the level of the highest honour, and also the commons were anxiousthat the censorship also should be brought within their participationthrough the medium of the same person who had opened a way to thedictatorship. Nor was any dissent [from this feeling] evinced at theelection, so that Marcius was elected censor along with Cneius Manlius.This year also had Marcus Fabius as dictator, not by reason of anyterror of war, but in order that the Licinian law should not be observedat the consular elections. Quintus Servilius was attached to thedictator as master of the horse. Nor yet did the dictatorship renderthat combination of the senators more effectual at the consularelections, than it had proved at that of the censors."Book 7,Chapter 23,"Marcus Popillius L¾nas was chosen consul on the part of the commons,Lucius Cornelius Scipio on that of the patricians. Fortune even renderedthe plebeian consul more distinguished; for when news was brought that avast army of the Gauls had pitched their camp in the Latin territory,Scipio being attacked with a serious fit of illness, the Gallic war wasintrusted out of course to Popillius. He having raised an army withgreat energy, after he had ordered the younger citizens to assemble inarms outside the Capuan gate, and the qu¾stors to carry the standardsfrom the treasury to the same place, having completed four legions, hegave the surplus of the men to the pr¾tor Publius Valerius Publicola,recommending to the senate to raise another army, which might be areserve to the state against the sudden contingencies of war. Hehimself, after sufficiently preparing and arranging every thing,proceeds towards the enemy; and in order to ascertain their strengthbefore he should hazard a decisive action, he commenced drawing anintrenchment on a hill, the nearest he could select to the camp of theGauls. They being a fierce race and of an eager turn for fighting, when,on descrying the standards of the Romans at a distance, they drew outtheir forces, as expecting to commence the battle forthwith, when theyperceived that neither the opposite army descended into the plain, andthat the Romans were protected both by the height of the ground and alsoby the entrenchments, supposing that they were dismayed with fear, andalso more exposed to attack, because they were intent on the work, theyadvance with a furious shout. On the side of the Romans neither theworks were interrupted, (it was the triarii who were employed at them,)but the battle was commenced by the hastati and the principes, who stoodin front of the workmen armed and prepared for the fight. Besides theirown valour, the higher ground aided them, so that all the spears andjavelins did not fall ineffectual, as when thrown on the same level, (asis generally the case,) but being steadied by their own weight they tookeffect; and the Gauls weighed down by the weapons, with which they hadtheir bodies transfixed, or their shields rendered too cumbrous by thosesticking in them. When they advanced almost up the steep at a run,becoming irresolute, they at first halted; then when the very delayshook the courage of the one party, and raised that of the enemy, beingthen pushed backwards they fell one upon the other, and produced acarnage among themselves more shocking than the carnage [caused by theenemy]. For more were crushed by the precipitate rout, than there wereslain by the sword."Book 7,Chapter 24,"Nor as yet was the victory decided in favour of the Romans; anotherdifficulty still was remaining for them after they had descended intothe plain; for the great numbers of the Gauls being such as to preventall feeling of such a disaster, raised up fresh troops against thevictorious enemy, as if a new army rose up once more. And the Romansstood still, suppressing their ardour; both because the struggle had tobe undergone a second time by them wearied as they were, and the consul,having his left arm well nigh transfixed with a javelin, whilst heexposed himself incautiously in the van, had retired for a short timefrom the field. And now, by the delay, the victory was on the point ofbeing relinquished, when the consul, having had his wound tied up,riding back to the van, cries out, ""Soldiers, why do you stand? You havenot to do with a Latin or Sabine enemy, whom, when you have vanquishedby your arms, from an enemy you may make an ally; against brutes we havedrawn our swords. Their blood must be drawn or ours given to them. Youhave repulsed them from your camp, you have driven them headlong downthe valley, you stand on the prostrated bodies of your foes. Fill theplains with the same carnage as you have filled the mountains; do notwait till they fly, you standing still; your standards must be advanced,you must proceed against the enemy."" Roused again by theseexhortations, they drive back from their ground the foremost companiesof the Gauls, and by forming wedges, they break through the centre oftheir body. By these means, the enemy being disunited, as being nowwithout regular command, or subordination of officers, they turn theirviolence against their own; and being dispersed through the plains, andcarried beyond their own camp in their precipitate flight, they make forthe citadel of Alba, which met their eyes as the most elevated amonghills of equal altitude. The consul, not pursuing them beyond the camp,because the wound weakened him, and he was unwilling to expose hiswearied army to hills occupied by the enemy, bestowed the entire plunderof the camp on the soldiers, and led back his army, victorious andenriched with the Gallic spoils, to Rome. The consul's wound occasioneda delay of the triumph, and the same cause made the senate wish for adictator, that there might be some one who, the consuls being both sick,should hold the elections. Lucius Furius Camillus being nominateddictator, Publius Cornelius Scipio being attached as master of thehorse, restored to the patricians their former possession of theconsulship. He himself being, for that service, elected consul, hadAppius Claudius Crassus named as his colleague."Book 7,Chapter 25,"Before the new consuls entered on their office, a triumph wascelebrated by Popillius over the Gauls amid the great applause of thecommons; and they, in a low voice, frequently asked one another, whetherany one was dissatisfied with a plebeian consul. At the same time theyfound fault with the dictator, who had obtained the consulship as abribe for having infringed the Licinian law, more dishonourable for theprivate ambition [evinced] thereby than for the injury inflicted on thepublic, so that, when dictator, he might have himself appointed consul.The year was remarkable for many and various commotions. The Gauls[descending] from the Alban mountains, because they were unable toendure the severity of the winter, straggling through the plains and theparts adjoining the sea, committed devastations. The sea was infested byfleets of the Greeks; and the borders of the Antian shore, and the mouthof the Tiber; so that the maritime plunderers, encountering those onland, fought on one occasion an obstinate fight, and separated, theGauls to their camp, the Greeks back to their ships, doubting whetherthey should consider themselves as vanquished or victors. Among thesethe greatest alarm arose at the circumstance, that assemblies of theLatin states were held at the grove of Ferentina; and an unequivocalanswer was given to the Romans on their ordering soldiers from them,""that they should cease to issue their orders to those of whoseassistance they stood in need: that the Latins would take up arms indefence of their own liberty, rather than for the dominion of others.""The senate becoming uneasy at the defection of their allies, whilst twoforeign wars existed at the same time, when they perceived that thosewhom fidelity had not restrained, should be restrained by fear, orderedthe consuls to exert to the utmost the energies of their authority inholding a levy. For that they should depend on an army of theircountrymen, since their allies were deserting them. Ten legions are saidto have been levied, consisting each of four thousand two hundredinfantry and three hundred horse. Such a newly-raised army, if anyforeign force should assail, the present power of the Roman people,which is scarcely confined within the whole world, could not easilyraise now, if concentrated upon one point: so true it is, we haveimproved in those particulars only about which we are solicitous, richesand luxury. Among the other distressing events of this year, AppiusClaudius, one of the consuls, dies in the midst of the preparations forthe war; and the whole direction of affairs devolved on Camillus; overwhom, the only consul, it did not appear seemly that a dictator shouldbe appointed, either in consideration of his high character, whichshould not be made subordinate to the dictatorship, or on account of theauspicious omen of his surname with respect to a Gallic war. The consul,then, having stationed two legions to protect the city, and divided theremaining eight with the pr¾tor Lucius Pinarius, mindful of his father'svalour, selects the Gallic war for himself without any appeal to lots:the pr¾tor he commanded to protect the sea-coast, and to drive theGreeks from the shore. And after he had marched down into the Pomptineterritory, because he neither wished to engage on the level ground, nocircumstance rendering it necessary, and he considered that the enemywere sufficiently subdued, by preventing from plunder persons whomnecessity obliged to live on what was so obtained, he selected asuitable place for a fixed encampment."Book 7,Chapter 26,"Where when they were spending the time in quiet in their quarters, aGaul, remarkable for his size and the appearance of his arms, cameforward; and striking his shield with his spear, after he had procuredsilence, through an interpreter he challenged any one of the Romans tocontend with him with the sword. There was a tribune of the soldiers, ayoung man, Marcus Valerius, who considering himself not less worthy ofthat distinction than Titus Manlius, having first ascertained theconsul's pleasure, advanced fully armed into the middle space. The humancontest was rendered less remarkable by reason of the interposition ofthe divine power. For just as the Roman was commencing the encounter, acrow settled suddenly on his helmet, facing the enemy, which, as anaugury sent from heaven, the tribune at first received with pleasure.Then he prayed that whatever god or goddess had sent him the auspiciousbird, would willingly and kindly aid him. Wondrous to relate, the birdnot only kept the place it had once taken, but as often as the encounterwas renewed, raising itself on its wings, it attacked the face and eyesof the foe with its beak and talons, until Valerius slays him, terrifiedat the sight of such a prodigy, and confounded both in his vision andunderstanding. The crow soaring out of sight makes towards the east.Hitherto the advanced guards on both sides remained quiet. When thetribune began to strip the body of the slain enemy, neither the Gaulsany longer confined themselves to their post, and the Romans began torun to their successful champion with still greater speed. There ascuffle taking place around the body of the prostrate Gaul, a desperatefight is stirred up. And now the contest is carried on not by thecompanies of the nearest posts, but by the legions pouring out from bothsides. The soldiers exulting in the victory of the tribune, and also atsuch favour and attention from the gods, are commanded by Camillus toadvance against the enemy: and he, pointing to the tribune distinguishedby the spoils, ""Soldiers,"" said he, ""imitate this man; and around theirfallen leader strew heaps of Gauls."" Gods and men assisted at thatfight; and the struggle was carried on against the Gauls with a fury byno means equivocal in its result, so thoroughly were both armiesimpressed with the respective success of the two soldiers, between whomthe single combat had taken place. Among the first party, whoseencounter had called out the others, there was a desperate encounter:the rest of the soldiery, before they came within throw of a weapon,turned their backs. At first they were dispersed through the Volsciansand the Falernian territory; thence they made for Apulia and the uppersea. The consul, calling an assembly, after heaping praises on thetribune, bestows on him ten oxen and a golden crown. He himself, beingcommanded by the senate to take charge of the maritime war, joined hiscamp to that of the pr¾tor. There because matters seemed to be delayedby the dastardly conduct of the Greeks, who did not venture into thefield, with the approbation of the senate, he nominated Titus ManliusTorquatus dictator. The dictator, after appointing Aulus CorneliusCossus his master of the horse, held the consular elections, and withthe greatest applause of the people he returned Marcus Valerius Corvus(for that was his surname from thenceforth) as consul, though absent,the rival of his own glory, then three and twenty years of age. Ascolleague to Corvus, Marcus Popillius L¾nas, a plebeian, was assigned tobe consul for the fourth time. Nothing memorable occurred betweenCamillus and the Greeks; neither the one were warriors by land, nor theRomans by sea. At length, when they were repelled from the shore, amongother things necessary for use, water also failing, they abandonedItaly. To what state or what nation that fleet belonged, there isnothing certain. I would be most inclined to think that they belonged tothe tyrants of Sicily; for the farther Greece, being at that timewearied by intestine war, was now in dread of the power of theMacedonians."Book 7,Chapter 27,"The armies being disbanded, whilst there was both peace abroad, andtranquillity at home by reason of the concord of the different orders,lest matters might be too happy, a pestilence having attacked the state,compelled the senate to order the decemvirs to inspect the Sibyllinebooks, and by their suggestion a lectisternium took place. The same yeara colony was led to Satricum by the Antians, and the city, which theLatins had demolished, was rebuilt. And a treaty was concluded at Romewith the Carthaginian ambassadors, they having come to requestfriendship and an alliance. The same tranquillity continued at home andabroad, during the consulate of Titus Manlius Torquatus and CaiusPlautius. Only the interest of money from twelve was reduced to six percent; and the payment of the debts was adjusted into equal portions ofthree years, on condition that the fourth payment should be made at thepresent time. And then also, though a portion of the commons weredistressed, still public credit engrossed the attention of the senate inpreference to the difficulties of private individuals. Theircircumstances were relieved most effectually, because a cessation wasintroduced of the taxes and levy. On the third year after Satricum wasrebuilt by the Volscians, Marcus Valerius Corvus having been electedconsul for the second time with Caius Poetelius, when news had beenbrought from Latium, that ambassadors from Antium were going round thestates of the Latins to excite a war, being ordered to attack theVolscians, before greater numbers of the enemy should be assembled,proceeds to Satricum with his army ready for action. And when theAntians and other Volscians met him, their forces being previouslyprepared, in case any movement should be made on the part of Rome, nodelay of engaging took place between the two parties incensed with longpent-up hate. The Volscians, a nation more spirited to renew hostilitiesthan to carry on war, being defeated in the fight, make for the walls ofSatricum in a precipitate flight; and their reliance in their walls notbeing sufficiently strong, when the city, encompassed by a continuousline of troops, was now on the point of being taken by scalade, theysurrendered to the number of four thousand soldiers, besides the unarmedmultitude. The town was demolished and burnt; only they kept the firefrom the temple of Mother Matuta. The entire plunder was given up to thesoldiers. The four thousand who had surrendered were consideredexclusive of the spoil; these the consul when triumphing drove beforehis chariot in chains; afterwards by selling them he brought a great sumof money into the treasury. There are some who state that this body ofcaptives consisted of slaves; and this is more probable than thatpersons who had surrendered were exposed to sale."Book 7,Chapter 28,"Marcus Fabius Dorso and Servius Sulpicius Camerinus succeeded theseconsuls. After this the Auruncan war commenced in consequence of asudden attempt at depredation: and through fear lest this act of onestate might be the concerted scheme of the whole Latin nation, LuciusFurius being created dictator, as if against all Latium already inarms, nominated Cneius Manlius Capitolinus his master of the horse. Andwhen, a suspension of public business being proclaimed, (a measureusually adopted during great alarms,) the levy was held withoutexemptions, the legions were led against the Auruncans with all possibleexpedition. The spirit of freebooters rather than of enemies was foundthere. They were vanquished therefore in the first encounter. Howeverthe dictator, both because they had commenced hostilities withoutprovocation, and presented themselves to the contest without reluctance,considering that the aid of the gods should also be engaged, vowed atemple to Juno Moneta in the heat of the battle, and when he returnedvictorious to Rome, obliged by his vow, he resigned his dictatorship.The senate ordered duumvirs to be appointed to have the temple builtsuitably to the grandeur of the Roman people; the site destined for itwas in the citadel, where the ground was on which the house of MarcusManlius Capitolinus had stood. The consuls, having employed thedictator's army for the Volscian war, took Sora from the enemy, havingattacked them by surprise. The temple of Moneta is dedicated the yearafter it had been vowed, Caius Marcius Rutilus being consul for thethird time, and Titus Manlius Torquatus for the second time. A prodigyimmediately followed the dedication, similar to the ancient one of theAlban mount. For it both rained stones, and during the day night seemedto be spread [over the sky]; and on the books being inspected, the statebeing filled with religious scruples, it was resolved by the senate thata dictator should be nominated for the purpose of regulating theceremonies. Publius Valerius Publicola was nominated; Quintus FabiusAmbustus was assigned to him as master of the horse. It was determinedthat not only the tribes, but the neighbouring states also should offersupplications: and a certain order was appointed for them on what dayeach should offer supplication. Severe sentences of the people are saidto have been passed on that year against usurers, for whom a day oftrial had been appointed by the ¾diles. Matters came to an interregnum,there being no particular reason on record. After the interregnum, boththe consuls were elected from the patricians, Marcus Valerius Corvus athird time, and Aulus Cornelius Cossus, so that it would seem that suchwas the end aimed at."Book 7,Chapter 29,"Henceforward shall be recorded wars of greater importance, both bythe strength of the belligerent powers, by the distance of thecountries, or the length of time during which they were carried on. Forin that year arms were taken up against the Samnites, a nation powerfulboth in wealth and in arms. Pyrrhus followed as an enemy the war of theSamnites carried on with various success, the Carthaginians followedPyrrhus. How great a mass of events! How often have extreme dangers beenencountered, that the empire might be raised to its present magnitude,which is now scarcely sustained! But the cause of the war between theSamnites and Romans, as they had been joined in alliance and friendship,came from without; it originated not among themselves. After theSamnites had unjustly taken up arms, because they had the advantage instrength, against the Sidicinians, the weaker party being obliged tohave recourse to the aid of the more powerful, unite themselves to theCampanians. As the Campanians brought to the relief of their alliesrather a name than strength, enervated as they were by luxury, they werebeaten in the Sidicinian territory by men who were inured to the use ofarms, and then brought on themselves the entire burthen of the war. Forthe Samnites, taking no further notice of the Sidicinians, havingattacked the Campanians as being the chief of the neighbouring states,from whom the victory might be equally easy, and a greater share ofspoil and glory, after they had secured Tifata, a ridge of hills hangingover Capua, with a strong garrison, they march down from thence withtheir army formed in a square into the plain which lies between Capuaand Tifata. There a second battle was fought; and the Campanians, afteran unsuccessful fight, being driven within their walls, when the flowerof their youth being cut down, no hope was nigh at hand, they wereobliged to sue for aid from the Romans."Book 7,Chapter 30,"Their ambassadors, being introduced into the senate, spoke as nearas possible to this purport: ""Conscript fathers, the Campanian state hassent us to you, to solicit from you friendship for ever, and presentaid, which if we had solicited whilst our affairs were prosperous, as itwould have commenced more readily, so would it have been bound by aweaker tie. For then, as we should have recollected that we entered intofriendship on equal terms, we might be equally friendly as now, butless submissive and compliant with your wishes. Now, won over by yourcompassion for us, and defended by your aid in our criticalcircumstances, it is incumbent on us that we show our sense also of thekindness received; lest we should seem ungrateful, and undeserving ofaid from either god or man. Nor, indeed, do I think that because theSamnites first became your allies and friends, such a circumstance issufficient to prevent our being admitted into friendship; but merelyshows that they excel us in priority and in the degree of honour; for noprovision has been made in your treaty with the Samnites that you shouldnot form any new treaties. It has ever been with you a sufficient titleto your friendship, that he who sought it desired to be a friend ofyours. We, Campanians, though our present state forbids us to speak inhigh terms, not yielding to any state save you in the extent of ourcity, or in the fertility of our land, come into friendship with you, noinconsiderable accession in my opinion to your flourishing condition. Weshall be in the rear of the ®quans and Volscians, the eternal enemies ofthis city, whenever they may stir; and whatever ye shall be the first toperform in defence of our safety, the same shall we ever do in defenceof your empire and glory. Those nations which lie between us and youbeing reduced, which both your bravery and good fortune makes it certainwill soon be the case, you will then have an uninterrupted empireextending even to us. It is distressing and painful, what our conditionobliges us to confess. Conscript fathers, matters are come to this, thatwe Campanians must be the property either of friends or enemies. If youdefend us, yours; if you desert us, we shall be the property of theSamnites. Consider, then, whether you would rather that Capua and allCampania should be added to your power or to that of the Samnites.Romans, it is surely but just, that your compassion and your aid shouldlie open to all men; to those, however, chiefly, who, whilst they affordit beyond their means to others imploring aid, have themselves beeninvolved in this distress. Although we fought nominally for theSidicinians, in reality for ourselves, when we saw a neighbouring stateassailed by the nefarious plunder of the Samnites; and after theSidicinians had been consumed, we saw that the conflagration would passover to ourselves. For the Samnites do not come to attack us, becausethey resent an injury received, but because they are glad that a pretexthas been presented to them. If this were the gratification of theirresentment, and not an occasion for satiating their ambition, was it notsufficient that they cut down our legions once in the Sidicinianterritory, a second time in Campania itself? What sort of resentmentmust that be, which the blood shed in two pitched battles cannotsatiate? To this add the laying waste of our lands; the spoil of men andcattle driven away, the burning and ruin of our country-houses, everything destroyed by fire and sword. Could not resentment be satisfiedwith this? But ambition must be satiated. That hurries them on tobesiege Capua. They either wish to destroy that most beautiful city, orto possess it themselves. But, Romans, do you take possession of it inyour kindness, rather than suffer them to hold it by injustice. I am notaddressing a people who decline just wars; but still, if you make but ashow of your aid, I do not think that you will have occasion for war.The contempt of the Samnites has just reached to us; it soars nothigher. Accordingly, Romans, we may be protected even by the shadow ofyour aid: whatever after this we shall possess, whatever we ourselvesshall be, determined to consider all that as yours. For you theCampanian field shall be ploughed; for you the city of Capua shall bemade populous; you shall be to us in the light of founders, parents, ay,even immortal gods. There shall be no colony of your own which shallsurpass us in attachment and loyalty to you. Grant to the Campanians,conscript fathers, your nod, and your irresistible favour, and bid ushope that Capua will be safe. With what crowds of persons of all classesattending us do you suppose that we set out from thence--how, think you,did we leave every place full of vows and tears? In what a state ofexpectation do you suppose that the senate are, the Campanian nation,our wives and our children? I am certain that the entire multitude arestanding at the gates, looking forward to the road that leads fromhence, anxious as to what answer you may order us, conscript fathers, tobring back to them, in their solicitude and suspense of mind. One kindof answer may bring them safety, victory, light, and liberty--what theother may, I feel horror to think. Determine therefore about us, asabout persons who will be your future friends and allies, or as personswho are to have no existence any where."""Book 7,Chapter 31,"The ambassadors then withdrawing, after the senate had beenconsulted, though to a great many, their city the greatest andwealthiest in Italy, their land the most fertile, and situated near thesea, seemed likely to prove a granary to the Roman people for allvarieties of provision; still the faith of their engagements was moreregarded than such great advantages, and the consul, by the direction ofthe senate, answered as follows: ""Campanians, the senate considers youdeserving of aid. But it is meet that friendship be so established withyou, that no prior friendship and alliance be violated. The Samnites areunited in a treaty with us. Therefore we refuse you arms against theSamnites, which would be a violation of duty to the gods first, and thento men. We will, as divine and human law requires, send ambassadors toour allies and friends to entreat that no violence be committed againstyou?"" To this the chief of the embassy replied, (for such were theinstructions they had brought from home,) ""Since you are not willing todefend by just force our possessions against violence and injustice, atleast you will defend your own. Wherefore, conscript fathers, wesurrender the Campanian people, and the city of Capua, their lands, thetemples of the gods, all things divine and human, into your jurisdictionand that of the Roman people; whatever we shall suffer henceforth, beingdetermined to suffer as men who have surrendered to you."" On thesewords, all extending their hands towards the consuls, bathed in tearsthey fell prostrate in the porch of the senate-house. The fathers,affected at the vicissitude of human greatness, seeing that a nationabounding in wealth, noted for luxury and pride, from which a littletime since their neighbours had solicited assistance, was now so brokenin spirit, as to give up themselves and all they possessed into thepower of others; moreover, their honour also seemed to be involved innot betraying those who had surrendered, nor did they consider that thepeople of the Samnites would act fairly, if they should attack aterritory and a city which had become the property of the Roman peopleby a surrender. It was resolved therefore, that ambassadors should besent forthwith to the Samnites; instructions were given ""that theyshould lay before the Samnites the entreaties of the Campanians, theanswer of the senate duly mindful of the friendship of the Samnites, andfinally the surrender that had been concluded. That they requested, inconsideration of the friendship and alliance subsisting between them,that they would spare their subjects; and that they would not carryhostilities into that territory which had become the property of theRoman people. If by gentle measures they did not succeed, that theyshould denounce to the Samnites in the name of the senate and Romanpeople, to withhold their arms from the city of Capua and the Campanianterritory."" When the ambassadors urged these matters in the assembly ofthe Samnites, so fierce an answer was returned, that they not only saidthat they would prosecute that war, but their magistrates, having goneout of the senate-house, in the very presence of the ambassadors,summoned the prefects of the cohorts; and with a distinct voicecommanded them, to proceed forthwith into the Campanian territory, inorder to plunder it."Book 7,Chapter 32,"The result of this embassy being reported at Rome, the care of allother concerns being laid aside, the senate, having despatched heraldsto demand satisfaction, and, because this was not complied with, warbeing proclaimed in the usual way, they decreed that the matter shouldbe submitted to the people at the very earliest opportunity; and boththe consuls having set out from the city by order of the people with twoarmies, Valerius into Campania, Cornelius into Samnium, the formerpitches his camp at Mount Gaurus, the latter at Saticula. The legions ofthe Samnites met with Valerius first; for they thought that the wholeweight of the war would incline to that side. At the same timeresentment stimulated them against the Campanians, that they should beso ready at one time to lend aid, at another to call in aid againstthem. But as soon as they beheld the Roman camp, they fiercely demandedthe signal each from his leader; they maintained that the Roman wouldbring aid to the Campanian with the same fate with which the Campanianhad done to the Sidicinian. Valerius, having delayed for a few days inslight skirmishes for the purpose of making trial of the enemy,displayed the signal for battle, exhorting his men in few words ""not tolet the new war or the new enemy terrify them. In proportion as theyshould carry their arms to a greater distance from the city, the moreand more unwarlike should the nation prove to be against whom theyshould proceed. That they should not estimate the valour of the Samnitesby the defeats of the Sidicinians and Campanians. Let the combatants beof what kind they may be, that it was necessary that one side should bevanquished. That as for the Campanians indeed, they were undoubtedlyvanquished more by circumstances flowing from excessive luxury and bytheir own want of energy than by the bravery of the enemy. What were thetwo successful wars of the Samnites, during so many ages, against somany glorious exploits of the Roman people, who counted almost moretriumphs than years since the building of their city? who held subduedby their arms all the states around them, the Sabines, Etruria, theLatins, Hernicians, ®quans, Volscians, Auruncans? who eventually droveby flight into the sea, and into their ships, the Gauls, afterslaughtering them in so many engagements? That soldiers ought both toenter the field relying on their national military renown, and on theirown valour, and also to consider under whose command and auspices thebattle is to be fought; whether he be one which is to be listened to asa pompous exhorter, bold merely in words, unacquainted with militarylabours, or one who knows how to wield arms himself also, to advancebefore the standards, and to show himself in the midst of the danger. Myacts, not my words merely, I wish you to follow; and to seek from me notmilitary orders only, but example also. It was not by intrigues merely,nor by cabals usual among the nobles, but by this right hand, I procuredfor myself three consulships, and the highest eulogies. There was a timewhen this could be said; [no wonder,] for you were a patrician, andsprung from the liberators of your country; and that family of yours hadthe consulship the same year that the city had consuls. Now theconsulship lies open in common to us patricians and to you plebeians;nor is it, as formerly, the prize of birth, but of valour. Look forward,therefore, soldiers, to even the highest honour. Though you, as men,have, with the approbation of the gods, given me this new surname ofCorvus, the ancient surname of our family, Publicol¾, has not beenerased from my memory. I ever do and ever have cultivated the good willof the Roman commons abroad and at home, as a private man and in publicoffices, high and low, as tribune equally as when consul, with the sameundeviating line of conduct through all my successive consulships. Now,with respect to that which is at hand, with the aid of the gods, joinwith me in seeking a new and complete triumph over the Samnites."""Book 7,Chapter 33,"Never was a general on a more familiar footing with his soldiers, byhis performing all the duties among the lowest of the soldiers withoutreluctance. Moreover in the military sports, wherein equals vie withtheir equals in contests of swiftness and strength, affable andcondescending, he conquered and was conquered with the same countenance;nor did he spurn any competitor who should offer; in his acts kindaccording to the occasion; in his conversation no less mindful of theease of others than of his own dignity; and, a thing than which nothingis more agreeable to the people, he administered his offices by the sameline of conduct by which he had gained them. The whole army therefore,cheering the exhortation of their leader with the utmost alacrity, marchforth from the camp. The battle commenced with equal hopes and equalstrength on both sides, as much as any battle ever did, with confidencein themselves, and without contempt of their enemies. Their recentexploits and their double victory a few days before, increased thespirits of the Samnites on the other side; the glories of four hundredyears and victory coeval with the building of their city [had the sameeffect] on the Romans; to both sides, however, the circumstance of theenemy being a new one gave additional anxiety. The battle was a proofwhat spirits they possessed; for they maintained the conflict in such amanner, that, for a considerable time, the armies inclined to neitherside. Then the consul, thinking that some confusion should be causedamong them, since they could not be overpowered by force, endeavours todisorder their foremost battalions by a charge of cavalry. And when hesaw them wheel their troops within a narrow compass in fruitlessdisorder, and that they could not open a passage to the enemy, ridingback to the van of the legions, after leaping from his horse, he says,""Soldiers, this is the task for us infantry; come on, as ye shall see memaking way with my sword, in whatever direction I shall advance into theenemy's line, so let each man, with all his might, beat down those whooppose him. All those places, where their erected spears now glitter,you shall see cleared by widely-extended slaughter."" He had utteredthese words, when the cavalry by order of the consul turn to the wings,and open a passage for the legions to the centre of the line. First ofall, the consul attacks the enemy, and slays him whom he happened toengage. Those on the right and left, fired at this sight, commence adreadful fight, each with the foe opposite him. The Samnites obstinatelystand their ground, though they receive more wounds than they inflict.The battle had now lasted for a considerable time, great slaughteroccurred around the standards of the Samnites; in no part was there aflight, so firmly had they made up their minds to be vanquished by deathalone. Wherefore the Romans, when they perceived their strength to relaxby fatigue, and but a small part of the day still remained, fired withfury, rush upon the enemy. Then for the first time it appeared that theywere giving ground, and that the matter was inclining to a flight; thenthe Samnites were taken, some slain; nor would many have survived, hadnot night terminated the victory rather than the battle. Both the Romansconfessed, that they had never fought with a more determined enemy; andthe Samnites, on being asked what cause first drove them to fly afterbeing so determined, said, that it was the eyes of the Romans whichseemed to them to flash fire, and their distracted looks, and furiousaspect; that more of terror arose from thence, than from any thing else.Which terror they confessed not only in the issue of the battle, but intheir departure by night. Next day the Romans take possession of thedeserted camp of the enemy, whither all the Campanians flocked tocongratulate them."Book 7,Chapter 34,"But this joy was well nigh alloyed by a great loss sustained inSamnium. For the consul Cornelius, having set out from Saticula,incautiously led his army into a mountainous tract, passable through adeep defile, and beset on all sides by the enemy; nor did he perceivethe enemy stationed over his head, until a retreat could no longer bemade with safety. Whilst the Samnites delayed only till he should bringdown his entire army into the valley; Publius Decius, a tribune of thesoldiers, espies in the tract a hill higher than the rest, hanging overthe enemies' camp, rather steep to be ascended by an encumbered army,not difficult for such as were lightly armed. He says therefore to theconsul, greatly alarmed in mind, ""Aulus Cornelius, do you perceive thatelevated point above the enemy? That is the bulwark of our hope andsafety, if we briskly gain possession of it, which the Samnites in theirblindness have given up. Only give me the first rank and spearmen of onelegion; when with these I shall have gained the summit, do you proceedhence free from all apprehension, and save yourself and the army. Forthe enemy, lying beneath us and [exposed thereby] to all our weapons,will not be able to stir without destruction to themselves. After thateither the good fortune of the Roman people or our own bravery willextricate us."" Being commanded by the consul, he received the body ofmen [required] and proceeds by secret paths through the mountain, norwas he observed by the enemy until he approached the place which he wasmaking for. Then, whilst all were struck with astonishment, after he hadattracted the eyes of all to himself, he both afforded the consul timeto draw off his army to more advantageous ground, and he himself wasposted on the top of the hill. The Samnites, whilst they march theirforces now in this direction, now in that, having lost the opportunityof effecting either object, can neither pursue the consul, unlessthrough the same defile in which they had him a little before exposed totheir weapons, nor march up the rising ground over themselves, which hadbeen seized on by Decius. But both their resentment stimulated them moreagainst the latter, who had taken from them the favourable opportunityof achieving their object, and also the proximity of the place, and thepaucity of the enemy; and one time they would fain surround the hill onall sides with armed men, so as to cut off Decius from the consul; atanother time they wished to open a passage, so that they may fall onthem when they had descended into the defile. Before they had determinedon what they should do, night came on them. Decius at first entertaineda hope, that he would have to engage them from the higher ground, asthey ascended against the steep; then surprise took possession of him,that they neither commenced the fight, nor if they were deterred fromthat by the unevenness of the ground, that they did not surround himwith works and a circumvallation. Then summoning the centurions to him,he said, ""What ignorance of war and indolence is that? or how did suchmen obtain a victory over the Sidicinians and Campanians? You see thattheir battalions move to and fro, that sometimes they are collected toone spot, at other times they are drawn out. As for work, no oneattempts it, when we might by this time have been surrounded with arampart. Then indeed should we be like to them, if we delay longer herethan is expedient. Come on, accompany me; that whilst some day lightremains, we may ascertain in what places they put their guards, in whatdirection an escape may lie open from hence."" All these points hecarefully observed, clad in a soldier's vest, the centurions whom hetook with him being also in the attire of common soldiers, lest theenemy might notice the general going the round."Book 7,Chapter 35,"Then having placed watch-guards, he commands the ticket to be issuedto all the rest, that when the signal had been given by the trumpet ofthe second watch, they should assemble to him in silence fully armed.Whither when they had assembled in silence according to the ordersissued, ""Soldiers,"" says he, ""this silence is to be observed inlistening to me, waving the military mode of expressing assent. When Ishall have thoroughly explained my sentiments to you, then such of youas shall approve the same, will pass over; we will follow that line ofconduct which shall meet the judgment of the majority. Now hear what Imeditate in mind. The enemy have surrounded you, not brought hither inflight, nor left behind through cowardice. By valour you seized thisground; by valour you must make your way from it. By coming hither youhave saved a valuable army of the Roman people; by forcing your wayhence, save yourselves. You have proved yourselves worthy, though few innumber, of affording aid to multitudes, whilst you yourselves stand inneed of aid from no one. You have to do with that enemy, who onyesterday, through their supineness, availed themselves not of thefortunate opportunity of destroying our whole army, who did not see thishill so advantageously situate hanging over their heads, until it wasseized on by us; who with so many thousand men did not prevent us so fewfrom the ascent, and did not surround us with a rampart when inpossession of the ground, though so much of the day still remained. Thatenemy which with their eyes open and awake you so baffled, it isincumbent on you now to beguile, buried, as they are, in sleep; nay, itis absolutely necessary. For our affairs are in that situation, that Iam rather to point out to you your necessity than to propose advice. Forwhether you are to remain or to depart hence, can no longer be matter ofdeliberation, since, with the exception of your arms, and couragemindful of those arms, fortune has left you nothing, and we must die offamine and thirst, if we are more afraid of the sword than becomes menand Romans. Therefore our only safety is to sally forth from this and todepart. That we must do either by day or by night. But lo! another pointwhich admits of less doubt; for if daylight be waited for, what hope isthere, that the enemy, who have now encompassed the hill on every side,as you perceive, with their bodies exposed at disadvantage, will not hemus in with a continued rampart and ditch? If night then be favourablefor a sally, as it is, this is undoubtedly the most suitable hour ofnight. You assembled here on the signal of the second watch, a timewhich buries mortals in the profoundest sleep. You will pass throughtheir bodies lulled to sleep, either in silence unnoticed by them, orready to strike terror into them, should they perceive you, by a suddenshout. Only follow me, whom you have followed. The same fortune whichconducted us hither, will I follow. Those of you to whom these measuresseem salutary, come on, pass over to the right."""Book 7,Chapter 36,"They all passed over, and followed Decius as he proceeded throughthe intervals which lay between the guards. They had now passed themiddle of the camp, when a soldier, striding over the bodies of thewatchmen as they lay asleep, occasioned a noise by striking one of theirshields. When the watchman, being aroused by this, stirred the next oneto him, and those who were awake stirred up others, not knowing whetherthey were friends or foes, whether it was the garrison that salliedforth or the consul had taken their camp; Decius, having ordered thesoldiers to raise a shout, as they were no longer unobserved,disheartens them by panic whilst still heavy from sleep, by which beingperplexed, they were neither able to take arms briskly, nor makeresistance, nor to pursue them. During the trepidation and confusion ofthe Samnites, the Roman guard, slaying such of the guards as came intheir way, reached the consul's camp. A considerable portion of nightstill remained, and things now appeared to be in safety; when Deciussays, ""Roman soldiers, be honoured for your bravery. Your journey andreturn ages shall extol. But to behold such bravery light and day arenecessary; nor do you deserve that silence and night should cover you,whilst you return to the camp with such distinguished glory. Here let uswait in quiet for the daylight."" His words they obeyed. And as soon asit was day, a messenger being despatched to the camp to the consul, theywere aroused from sleep with great joy; and the signal being given byticket, that those persons returned safe who had exposed their personsto evident danger for the preservation of all, rushing out each mostanxiously to meet them, they applaud them, congratulate them, they callthem singly and collectively their preservers, they give praises andthanks to the gods, they raise Decius to heaven. This was a sort of camptriumph for Decius, who proceeded through the middle of the camp, withhis guard fully armed, the eyes of all being fixed on him, and allgiving him equal honour with the consul. When they came to the general'stent, the consul summons them by sound of trumpet to an assembly; andcommencing with the well-earned praises of Decius, he adjourned theassembly on the interposition of Decius himself, who advising thepostponement of every thing else, whilst the occasion was still present,persuaded the consul to attack the enemy, whilst still in consternationfrom the panic of the night, and dispersing in separate detachmentsaround the hill, [adding] that he believed that some who had been sentout in pursuit of him were straggling through the forest. The legionswere ordered to take arms; and having departed from the camp, as theforest was now better known by means of scouts, they are led onwards tothe enemy through a more open tract. Having unexpectedly attacked theenemy when off their guard, since the soldiers of the Samnitesstraggling in every direction, most of them unarmed, were not ableeither to rally, nor to take arms, nor to betake themselves within therampart, they first drive them in a panic into the camp: then they takethe camp itself, having dislodged the guards. The shout spread aroundthe hill; and puts each to flight from their respective posts. Thus agreat part yielded to an enemy they had not seen. Those whom the panichad driven within the rampart (they amounted to thirty thousand) wereall slain; the camp was plundered."Book 7,Chapter 37,"Matters being thus conducted, the consul, having summoned anassembly, pronounces a panegyric on Decius, not only that which had beencommenced on a previous occasion, but as now completed by his recentdeserts; and besides other military gifts, he presents him with a goldencrown and one hundred oxen, and with one white one of distinguishedbeauty, richly decorated with gilded horns. The soldiers who had been inthe guard with him, were presented with a double allowance of corn forever; for the present, with an ox and two vests each. Immediately afterthe consuls' donation, the legions place on the head of Decius a crownof grass, indicative of their deliverance from a blockade, expressingtheir approbation of the present with a shout. Decorated with theseemblems, he sacrificed the beautiful ox to Mars; the hundred oxen hebestowed on the soldiers, who had been with him in the expedition. Onthe same soldiers the legions conferred, each a pound of corn and a pintof wine; and all these things were performed with great alacrity, with amilitary shout, a token of the approbation of all. The third battle wasfought near Suessula, in which the army of the Samnites, having beenrouted by Marcus Valerius, having summoned from home the flower of theiryouth, determined on trying their strength by a final contest. FromSuessula messengers came in great haste to Capua, and from thencehorsemen in full speed to the consul Valerius, to implore aid. Thetroops were immediately put in motion; and the baggage in the camp beingleft with a strong guard, the army moves on with rapidity; and theyselect at no great distance from the enemy a very narrow spot (as, withthe exception of their horses, they were unaccompanied by a crowd ofcattle and servants). The army of the Samnites, as if there was to be nodelay in coming to an engagement, draw up in order of battle; then, whenno one came to meet them, they advance to the enemy's camp in readinessfor action. There when they saw the soldiers on the rampart, and personssent out to reconnoitre in every direction, brought back word into hownarrow a compass the camp had been contracted, inferring thence thescanty number of the enemy. The whole army began to exclaim, that thetrenches ought to be filled up, the rampart to be torn down, and thatthey should force their way into the camp; and by that temerity the warwould have been soon over, had not the generals restrained theimpetuosity of the soldiers. However, as their own numbers bore heavilyon their supplies, and in consequence, first of their sitting down solong at Suessula, and then by the delay of the contest, they were notfar from a want of provisions, it was determined, whilst the enemyremained shut up as if through fear, that the soldiers should be ledthrough the country to forage; [supposing] in the mean time, that allsupplies would fail the Romans also, who having marched in haste, hadbrought with him only as much corn as could be carried on his shouldersamid his arms. The consul, after he had observed the enemy scatteredthrough the country, that the posts were left but insufficientlyattended, having in a few words encouraged his men, leads them on tobesiege the camp. After he had taken this on the first shout andcontest, more of the enemy being slain in their tents than at the gatesand rampart, he ordered the captive standards to be collected into oneplace, and having left behind two legions as a guard and protection,after giving them strict order that they should abstain from the booty,until he himself should return; having set out with his troops inregular order, the cavalry who had been sent on driving the dispersedSamnites as it were by hunting toils, he committed great slaughter amongthem. For in their terror they could neither determine by what signalthey should collect themselves into a body, whether they should make forthe camp, or continue their flight to a greater distance. And so greatwas their terror, and so precipitate their flight, that to the number offorty thousand shields, though by no means were so many slain, and onehundred and seventy standards, with those which had been taken in thecamp, were brought to the consul. Then they returned to the enemy'scamp; and there all the plunder was given up to the soldiers."Book 7,Chapter 38,"The result of this contest obliged the Faliscians, who were on termsof a truce, to petition for a treaty of alliance from the senate; anddiverted the Latins, who had their armies already prepared, from theRoman to a Pelignian war. Nor did the fame of such success confineitself within the limits of Italy; but the Carthaginians also sentambassadors to Rome to congratulate them, with an offering of a goldencrown, to be placed in Jupiter's shrine in the Capitol. Its weight wastwenty-five pounds. Both consuls triumphed over the Samnites, whilstDecius followed distinguished with praises and presents, when amid therough jesting of the soldiers the name of the tribune was no lesscelebrated than that of the consuls. The embassies of the Campanians andSuessulans were then heard; and to their entreaties it was granted thata garrison should be sent thither, in order that the incursions of theSamnites might be repelled. Capua, even then by no means favourable tomilitary discipline, alienated from the memory of their country theaffections of the soldiers, which were debauched by the supply ofpleasures of all kinds; and schemes were being formed in winter-quartersfor taking away Capua from the Campanians by the same kind of wickednessas that by which they had taken it from its original possessors: ""andnot undeservedly would they turn their own example against themselves.For why should the Campanians, who were neither able to defendthemselves nor their possessions, occupy the most fertile land of Italy,and a city worthy of that land, rather than the victorious army, who haddriven the Samnites from thence by their sweat and blood? Was itreasonable that men who had surrendered to them should have the fullenjoyment of that fertile and delightful country; that they, wearied bymilitary toil, had to struggle in an insalubrious and arid soil aroundtheir city, or within the city to suffer the oppressive and exhaustingweight of interest-money daily increasing?"" These schemes agitated insecret cabals, and as yet communicated only to a few, were encounteredby the new consul Caius Marcius Rutilus, to whom the province ofCampania had fallen by lot, Quintus Servilius, his colleague, being leftbehind in the city. Accordingly when he was in possession of all thesecircumstances just as they had occurred, having ascertained them throughthe tribunes, matured by years and experience, (for he was consul nowfor the fourth time, and had been dictator and censor,) thinking it thewisest proceeding to frustrate the violence of the soldiers, byprolonging their hope of executing their project whenever they mightwish, he spreads the rumour, that the troops were to winter in the sametowns on the year after also. For they had been cantoned throughout thecities of Campania, and their plots had spread from Capua to the entirearmy. This abatement being given to the eagerness of their projects, themutiny was set at rest for the present."Book 7,Chapter 39,"The consul, having led out his army to the summer campaign,determined, whilst he had the Samnites quiet, to purge the army bysending away the turbulent men; by telling some that their regular timehad been served; that others were weighed down by years and debilitatedin bodily vigour. Some were sent away on furloughs, at firstindividuals, then some cohorts also, on the plea that they had winteredfar from their home and domestic affairs. When different individualswere sent to different places under pretence of the business of theservice, a considerable number were put out of the way; which multitudethe other consul detained in Rome under different pretences. And firstindeed, not suspecting the artifice, they returned to their homes by nomeans with reluctance. After they saw that neither those first sentreturned to their standards, and that scarcely any others, except thosewho had wintered in Campania, and chiefly the fomenters of the mutiny,were sent away; at first wonder, and then certain fear entered theirminds, that their schemes had been divulged; ""that now they would haveto suffer trials, discoveries, the secret punishments of individuals,and the tyrannical and cruel despotism of the consuls and the senate.Those who were in the camp, discuss these things in secret conferences,seeing that the sinews of the conspiracy had been got rid of by theartifice of the consul."" One cohort, when they were at no great distancefrom Anxur, posted itself at Lautul¾, in a narrow woody pass between thesea and the mountains, to intercept those whom the consul was dismissingunder various pretences (as has been already mentioned). Their body wasnow becoming strong in numbers; nor was any thing wanting to completethe form of a regular army, except a leader. Without order, therefore,they come into the Alban territory committing depredations, and underthe hill of Alba Longa, they encompass their camp with a rampart. Thework here being completed, during the remainder of the day they discusstheir different opinions regarding the choice of a commander, not havingsufficient confidence in any of those present. Whom could they inviteout from Rome? What individuals of the patricians or of the commons wasthere, who would either knowingly expose himself to such imminentdanger, or to whom could the cause of the army, set mad byill-treatment, be safely committed? On the following day, when the samesubject of deliberation detained them, some of the straggling maraudersascertained and brought an account, that Titus Quinctius cultivated afarm in the Tusculan territory, forgetful of the city and its honours.This was a man of patrician family, whose military career, which waspassed with great glory, having been relinquished in consequence of oneof his feet being lamed by a wound, he determined on spending his lifein the country far from ambition and the forum. His name once heard,they immediately recognised the man; and with wishes for success,ordered him to be sent for. There was, however, but little hope that hewould do any thing voluntarily; they resolved on employing force andintimidation. Accordingly those who had been sent for the purpose,having entered the house in the silence of the night, and surprisingQuinctius overcome in sleep, threatening that there was no alternative,either authority and honour, or death, in case he resisted, unless hefollowed, they force him to the camp. Immediately on his arrival he wasstyled general, and whilst he was startled at the strange nature of thesudden occurrence, they convey to him the ensigns of honour, and bid himlead them to the city. Then having torn up their standard, more underthe influence of their own impetuosity than by the command of theirgeneral, they arrive in hostile array at the eighth stone on the road,which is now the Appian; and would have proceeded immediately to thecity, had they not heard that an army was coming to meet them, and thatMarcus Valerius Corvus was nominated dictator against them, and Lucius®milius Mamercinus master of the horse."Book 7,Chapter 40,"As soon as they came in sight and recognised the arms and standards,instantly the recollection of their country softened the resentment ofall. Not yet were they so hardy as to shed the blood of theircountrymen, nor had they known any but foreign wars, and secession fromtheir own was deemed the extreme of rage. Accordingly now the generals,now the soldiers sought a meeting for a negotiation. Quinctius, who wassatiated with arms [taken up] even in defence of his country, much moreso against it; Corvus, who entertained a warm affection for all hiscountrymen, chiefly the soldiers, and above others, for his own army,advanced to a conference. To him, being immediately recognised, silencewas granted with no less respect by his adversaries, than by his ownparty: he says, ""Soldiers, at my departure from the city, I prayed tothe immortal gods, your public deities as well as mine, and earnestlyimplored their goodness so, that they would grant me the glory ofestablishing concord among you, not victory over you. There have beenand there will be sufficient opportunities, whence military fame may beobtained: on this occasion peace should be the object of our wishes.What I earnestly called for from the immortal gods when offering up myprayers, you have it in your power to grant to me, if you will remember,that you have your camp not in Samnium, nor among the Volscians, but onRoman ground; that those hills which you behold are those of yourcountry, that this is the army of your countrymen; that I am your ownconsul, under whose guidance and auspices ye last year twice defeatedthe legions of the Samnites, twice took their camp by storm. Soldiers, Iam Marcus Valerius Corvus, whose nobility ye have felt by acts ofkindness towards you, not by ill-treatment; the proposer of notyrannical law against you, of no harsh decree of the senate; in everypost of command more strict on myself than on you. And if birth, ifpersonal merit, if high dignity, if public honours could suggestarrogance to any one, from such ancestors have I been descended, such aspecimen had I given of myself, at such an age did I attain theconsulship, that when but twenty-three years old I might have been aproud consul, even to the patricians, not to the commons only. What actor saying of mine, when consul, have ye heard of more severe than whenonly tribune? With the same tenor did I administer two successiveconsulships; with the same shall this uncontrollable office, thedictatorship, be administered. So that I shall be found not moreindulgent to these my own soldiers and the soldiers of my country, thanto you, I shudder to call you so, its enemies. Ye shall therefore drawthe sword against me, before I draw it against you. On that side thesignal shall be sounded, on that the shout and onset shall begin, if abattle must take place. Determine in your minds, on that which neitheryour fathers nor grandfathers could; neither those who seceded to theSacred Mount, nor yet those who afterwards posted themselves on theAventine. Wait till your mothers and wives come out to meet you from thecity with dishevelled hair, as they did formerly to Coriolanus. At thattime the legions of the Volscians, because they had a Roman for theirleader, ceased from hostilities; will not ye, a Roman army, desist froman unnatural war? Titus Quinctius, under whatever circumstances youstand on that side, whether voluntarily or reluctantly, if there must befighting, do you then retire to the rear. With more honour even will youfly, and turn your back to your countryman, than fight against yourcountry. Now you will stand with propriety and honour among the foremostto promote peace; and may you be a salutary agent in this conference.Require and offer that which is just; though we should admit even unjustterms, rather than engage in an impious combat with each other."" TitusQuinctius, turning to his party with his eyes full of tears, said, ""Inme too, soldiers, if there is any use of me, ye have a better leader forpeace than for war. For that speech just now delivered, not a Volscian,nor a Samnite expressed, but a Roman: your own consul, your own general,soldiers: whose auspices having already experienced for you, do not wishto experience them against you. The senate had other generals also, whowould engage you with more animosity; they have selected the one whowould be most indulgent to you, his own soldiers, in whom as yourgeneral you would have most confidence. Even those who can conquer,desire peace: what ought we to desire? Why do we not, renouncingresentment and hope, those fallacious advisers, resign ourselves and allour interests to his tried honour?"""Book 7,Chapter 41,"All approving with a shout, Titus Quinctius, advancing before thestandards, declared that ""the soldiers would be obedient to thedictator; he entreated that he would espouse the cause of hisunfortunate countrymen, and having espoused it, he would maintain itwith the same fidelity with which he had wont to administer publicaffairs. That for himself individually he made no terms: that he wouldfound his hope in nothing else but in his innocence. That provisionshould be made for the soldiers, as provision had been made by thesenate, once for the commons, a second time for the legions, so that thesecession should not be visited with punishment."" The dictator, havinglauded Quinctius, and having bid the others to hope for the best,returned back to the city with all speed, and, with the approbation ofthe senate, proposed to the people in the Peteline grove, that thesecession should not be visited with chastisement on any of thesoldiers. He also entreated, with their permission, that no one shouldeither in jest or earnest upbraid any one with that proceeding. Amilitary devoting law was also passed, that the name of any soldier onceenrolled, should not be erased unless with his own consent; and to thelaw [a clause] was added that no one, after he had been a tribune of thesoldiers, should afterwards be a centurion. That demand was made by theconspirators on account of Publius Salonius; who in alternate years wasboth tribune of the soldiers and first centurion, which they now call_primi pili_. The soldiers were incensed against him, because he hadalways been opposed to their recent measures, and had fled from Lantul¾,that he might have no share in them. Accordingly when this alone was notobtained from the senate through their regard for Salonius, thenSalonius, conjuring the conscript fathers, that they would not value hispromotion more highly than the concord of the state, prevailed in havingthat also carried. Equally ineffectual was the demand, that somedeductions should be made from the pay of the cavalry, (they thenreceived triple,) because they had opposed the conspiracy."Book 7,Chapter 42,"Besides these, I find in some writers that Lucius Genucius, tribuneof the commons, proposed to the people, that no one should be allowed topractise usury; likewise provision was made by other enactments, that noone should fill the same office within ten years; nor hold two officeson the same year; and that it should be allowed that both the consulsshould be plebeians. If all these concessions were made to the people,it is evident that the revolt possessed no little strength. In otherannals it is recorded, that Valerius was not appointed dictator, butthat the entire business was managed by the consuls; and also that thatband of conspirators were driven to arms not before they came to Rome,but at Rome; and that it was not on the country-house of TitusQuinctius, but on the residence of Caius Manlius the assault was made bynight, and that he was seized by the conspirators to become theirleader: that having proceeded thence to the fourth mile-stone, theyposted themselves in a well-defended place; and that it was not with theleaders mention of a reconciliation originated; but that suddenly, whenthe armies marched out to battle fully armed, a mutual salutation tookplace; that mixing together the soldiers began to join hands, and toembrace each other with tears; and that the consuls, on seeing the mindsof the soldiers averse from fighting, made a proposition to the senateconcerning the re-establishment of concord. So that among ancientwriters nothing is agreed on, except that there was a mutiny, and thatit was composed. Both the report of this disturbance, and the heavy warentered into with the Samnites, alienated some states from the Romanalliance: and besides the treaty of the Latins, which now for a longtime was not to be depended on, the Privernians also by a suddenincursion laid waste Norba and Setia, Roman colonies in theirneighbourhood."Book 8,Chapter 1,"The consuls now were Caius Plautius a second time, and Lucius ®miliusMamercinus; when the people of Setia and Norba came to Rome to announcethe revolt of the Privernians, with complaints of the damages receivedby them. News were brought that the army of the Volscians, under theguidance of the people of Antium, had taken post at Satricum. Both warsfell by lot to Plautius. He, marching first to Privernum, immediatelycame to an engagement. The enemy were defeated after a slightresistance: the town was taken, and given back to the Privernians, astrong garrison being placed in it: two thirds of their land were takenfrom them. The victorious army was marched thence to Satricum againstthe Antians; there a desperate battle was fought with great slaughter onboth sides; and when a storm separated the combatants, hope inclining toneither side, the Romans, nowise disheartened by this so indecisive anengagement, prepare for battle against the following day. TheVolscians, reckoning up what men they had lost in battle, had by nomeans the same spirits to repeat the risk. They went off in the night toAntium as a vanquished army in the utmost confusion, leaving behindtheir wounded and a part of their baggage. A vast quantity of arms wasfound, both among the dead bodies of the enemy, and also in the camp.These, the consul declared, that he offered up to Mother Lua; and helaid waste the enemy's country as far as the sea-coast. The otherconsul, ®milius, on entering the Sabellan territory, found neither acamp of the Samnites nor legions opposed to him. Whilst he laid wastetheir territories with fire and sword, the ambassadors of the Samnitescame to him, suing for peace; by whom being referred to the senate,after leave to address them was granted, laying aside their ferociousspirits, they sued for peace for themselves from the Romans, and theright of waging war against the Sidicinians. Which requests, [theyalleged,] that ""they were the more justified in making, because they hadboth united in friendship with the Roman people, when their affairs wereflourishing, not under circumstances of distress, as the Campanians haddone, and they were taking up arms against the Sidicinians, ever theirenemies, never the friends of the Roman people; who had neither, as theSamnites, sought their friendship in time of peace, nor, as theCampanians, their assistance in time of war, and were neither inalliance with, nor under subjection to the Roman people."""Book 8,Chapter 2,"After the pr¾tor Tiberius ®milius had consulted the senate respectingthe demands of the Samnites, and the senate voted that the treaty shouldbe renewed with them, the pr¾tor returned this answer to the Samnites:""That it neither had been the fault of the Roman people that theirfriendship with them was not perpetual; nor was any objection made tothat friendship being once more re-established, since they themselveswere now become tired of a war entered into through their own fault.With respect to what regarded the Sidicinians, they did not interferewith the Samnite nation having the free decision of peace and war."" Thetreaty being concluded, on their return home, the Roman army wasimmediately withdrawn after they had received a year's pay, and corn forthree months: for which the consul had stipulated, to grant time for atruce, until the ambassadors should return. The Samnites having marchedagainst the Sidicinians with the same forces which they had employed intheir war against the Romans, entertained rather sanguine hopes ofbecoming masters of the enemies' citadel. Then the Sidicinians firstbegan to surrender to the Romans. Afterwards, when the senate rejectedthat offer as too late, and as being wrung from them by extremenecessity, it was made to the Latins, who were already taking up arms ontheir own account. Nor did even the Campanians (so much stronger wastheir recollection of the injuries done them by the Samnites than of thekindness of the Romans) keep themselves from this quarrel. Out of theseso many states, one vast army, entering the territories of the Samnitesunder the direction of the Latins, committed more damage by depredationsthan by battles; and though the Latins had the advantage in the field,they retired out of the enemies' territory without reluctance, that theymight not be obliged to fight too frequently. This opportunity wasafforded to the Samnites to send ambassadors to Rome. When they appearedbefore the senate, having complained that they, though now confederates,were subjected to the same hardships as those they had suffered asenemies, solicited, with the humblest entreaties, that ""the Romans wouldthink it enough the victory, of which they had deprived the Samnites,over their Campanian and Sidicinian enemy; that they would not besidessuffer them to be vanquished by these most dastardly states. That theycould by their sovereign authority keep the Latins and the Campaniansout of the Samnite territory, if they really were under the dominion ofthe Roman people; but if they rejected their authority, that they mightcompel them by arms."" To this an equivocal answer was returned, becauseit was mortifying to acknowledge, that the Latins were not now in theirpower, and they were afraid lest by finding fault they might estrangethem from their side: that the case of the Campanians was different,they having come under their protection, not by treaty but by surrender:accordingly, that the Campanians, whether they wished or not, shouldremain quiet: that in the Latin treaty there was no clause by which theywere prevented from going to war with whomsoever they pleased."Book 8,Chapter 3,"Which answer, whilst it sent away the Samnites uncertain as to whatconduct they were to think that the Romans would pursue, it furtherestranged the Campanians through fear; it rendered the Samnites morepresuming, they considering that there was nothing which the Romanswould now refuse them. Wherefore, proclaiming frequent meetings underthe pretext of preparing for war against the Samnites, their leadingmen, in their several deliberations among themselves, secretly fomentedthe plan of a war with Rome. In this war the Campanians too joinedagainst their preservers. But though all their schemes were carefullyconcealed, and they were anxious that their Samnite enemy should be gotrid of in their rear before the Romans should be aroused, yet throughthe agency of some who were attached [to the latter] by privatefriendships and other ties, information of their conspiracy made its wayto Rome, and the consuls being ordered to resign their office before theusual time, in order that the new consuls might be elected the sooner tomeet so important a war, a religious scruple entered their minds at theidea of the elections being held by persons whose time of office hadbeen cut short. Accordingly an interregnum took place. There were twointerreges, Marcus Valerius and Marcus Fabius. The consuls elected wereTitus Manlius Torquatus a third time, and Publius Decius Mus. It isagreed on that, in this year, Alexander, king of Epirus, made a descenton Italy with a fleet. Which war, if the first commencement had beensufficiently successful, would unquestionably have extended to theRomans. The same was the era of the exploits of Alexander the Great,whom, being son to the other's sister, in another region of the world,having shown himself invincible in war, fortune cut short in his youthby disease. But the Romans, although the revolt of their allies and ofthe Latin nation was now no matter of doubt, yet as if they feltsolicitude regarding the Samnites, not for themselves, summoned ten ofthe leading men of the Latins to Rome, to whom they wished to issue suchorders as they might wish. Latium had at that time two pr¾tors, LuciusAnnius, a native of Setia, and Lucius Numisius of Circeii, both from theRoman colonists; through whose means, besides Signia and Velitr¾, alsoRoman colonies, the Volscians too had been stirred up to arms. It wasdetermined that these two should be summoned specially; it was a matterof doubt to no one, on what matter they were sent for. Accordingly thepr¾tors, having held an assembly, before they set out for Rome, informthem, that they were summoned by the Roman senate, and consult them asto what answer it was their wish should be given on those subjects whichthey thought would be discussed with them."Book 8,Chapter 4,"When different persons advanced different opinions, then Annius says:""Though I myself put the question, as to what answer it might be yourpleasure should be given, yet I think it more concerns our generalinterest how we should act than how we should speak. Your plans beingonce unfolded, it will be easy to suit words to the subject; for if evennow we are capable of submitting to slavery under the shadow of aconfederacy on equal terms, what is wanting but to betray theSidicinians, be obedient to the orders not only of the Romans, but ofthe Samnites, and tell the Romans, that we will lay down our armswhenever they intimate it to be their wish? But if at length a desire ofliberty stimulates your minds, if a confederacy does subsist, ifalliance be equalization of rights, if there be reason now to boast thatwe are of the same blood as the Romans, of which they were formerlyashamed, if they have such an army of allies, by the junction of whichthey may double their strength, such a one as their consuls would beunwilling to separate from themselves either in concluding or commencingtheir own wars; why are not all things equalized? why is not one of theconsuls chosen from the Latins? Where there is an equal share ofstrength, is there also an equal share in the government? This indeed initself reflects no extraordinary degree of honour on us, as stillacknowledging Rome to be the metropolis of Latium; but that it maypossibly appear to do so, has been effected by our long-continuedforbearance. But if ye ever wished for an opportunity of sharing in thegovernment, and enjoying freedom, lo! this opportunity is now at hand,presented both by your own valour and the bounty of the gods. Ye havetried their patience by refusing them soldiers. Who doubts that theywere fired with rage, when we broke through a custom of more than twohundred years? Still they submitted to this feeling of resentment. Wewaged war with the Pelignians in our own name. They who formerly did noteven concede to us the right of defending our own territories throughourselves, interfered not. They heard that the Sidicinians werereceived under our protection, that the Campanians had revolted fromthemselves to us, that we were preparing armies against theirconfederates, the Samnites; yet they stirred not from the city. Whencethis so great forbearance on their part, except from a knowledge of ourstrength and their own? I have it from competent authority, that whenthe Samnites complained of us, such an answer was given them by theRoman senate, as plainly showed that not even themselves insisted thatLatium was under the Roman jurisdiction. Only assume your rights indemanding that which they tacitly concede to you. If fear prevents anyone from saying this, lo! I pledge myself that I will say it, in thehearing not only of the Roman people and senate, but of Jupiter himself,who inhabits the Capitol; that if they wish us to be in confederacy andalliance with them, they are to receive one consul from us, and one halfof the senate."" When he not only recommended these measures boldly, butpromised also his aid, they all, with acclamations of assent, permittedhim to do and say whatever might appear to him conducive to the republicof the Latin nation and his own honour."Book 8,Chapter 5,"When they arrived in Rome, an audience of the senate was granted themin the Capitol. There, when Titus Manlius the consul, by direction ofthe senate, required of them not to make war on their confederates theSamnites, Annius, as if he had taken the Capitol by arms as a victor,and were not addressing them as an ambassador protected by the law ofnations, says: ""It were time, Titus Manlius, and you, conscript fathers,to cease at length treating with us on a footing of superiority, whenyou see Latium in a most flourishing state by the bounty of the gods inarms and men, the Samnites being vanquished in war, the Sidicinians andCampanians our allies, the Volscians now united to us in alliance, andthat your own colonies even prefer the government of Latium to that ofRome. But since ye do not bring your minds to put an end to yourarbitrary despotism, we, though able by force of arms to vindicate theindependence of Latium, yet will make this concession to the ties ofblood between us, as to offer terms of peace on terms of equality forboth, since it has pleased the immortal gods that the strength of bothis equalized. One of the consuls must be selected out of Rome, theother out of Latium; an equal portion of the senate must be from bothnations; we must be one people, one republic; and that the seat ofgovernment may be the same, and we all may have the same name, since theconcession must be made by the one party or other, let this, and may itbe auspicious to both, have the advantage of being the mother country,and let us all be called Romans."" It so happened that the Romans alsohad a consul, a match for this man's high spirit; who, so far fromrestraining his angry feelings, openly declared, that if suchinfatuation took possession of the conscript fathers, that they wouldreceive laws from a man of Setia, he would himself come into the senatearmed with a sword, and would slay with his hand any Latin whom heshould see in the senate-house. And turning to the statue of Jupiter,""Hear thou, Jupiter,"" says he, ""hear these impious proposals; hear yethem, Justice and Equity. Jupiter, art thou to behold foreign consulsand a foreign senate in thy consecrated temple, as if thou wert acaptive and overpowered? Were these the treaties which Tullus, a Romanking, concluded with the Albans, your forefathers, Latins, and whichLucius Tarquinius subsequently concluded with you? Does not the battleat the Lake Regillus occur to your thoughts? Have you so forgotten yourown calamities and our kindnesses towards you?"""Book 8,Chapter 6,"When the indignation of the senate followed these words of theconsul, it is recorded that, in reply to the frequent appeals to thegods, whom the consuls frequently invoked as witnesses to the treaties,an expression of Annius was heard in contempt of the divinity of theRoman Jupiter. Certainly, when aroused with wrath he was proceeding withrapid steps from the porch of the temple, having fallen down the stairs,his head being severely struck, he was dashed against a stone at thebottom with such force, as to be deprived of sense. As all writers donot say that he was killed, I too shall leave it in doubt; as also thecircumstance, that a storm, with a dreadful noise in the heavens, tookplace during the appeal made in reference to the violated treaties; forthey may both be true, and also invented aptly to express in a strikingmanner the resentment of heaven. Torquatus, being despatched by thesenate to dismiss the ambassadors, on seeing Annius lying prostrate,exclaimed, so as that his voice was heard both by the people and thesenate, ""It is well. The gods have excited a just war. There is a deityin heaven. Thou dost exist, great Jove; not without reason have weconsecrated thee the father of gods and men in this mansion. Why do yehesitate, Romans, and you, conscript fathers, to take up arms under thedirection of the gods? Thus will I lay low the legions of the Latins, asyou now see this man lying prostrate."" The words of the consul, receivedwith the approbation of the people, filled their breasts with suchardour, that the ambassadors on their departure were protected from theanger and violence of the people more by the care of the magistrates,who escorted them by order of the consul, than by the law of nations.The senate also voted for the war; and the consuls, after raising twoarmies, marched into the territories of the Marsians and Pelignians, thearmy of the Samnites having joined them, and pitched their camp nearCapua, where the Latins and their allies had now assembled. There it issaid there appeared to both the consuls, during sleep, the same form ofa man larger and more majestic than human, who said, ""Of the one side ageneral, of the other an army was due to the dii Manes and to MotherEarth; from whichever army a general should devote the legions of theenemy and himself, in addition, that the victory would belong to thatnation and that party."" When the consuls compared together these visionsof the night, it was resolved that victims should be slain for thepurpose of averting the anger of the gods; at the same time, that if thesame portents were exhibited in the entrails as those which had beenseen during sleep, either of the consuls should fulfil the fates. Whenthe answers of the haruspices coincided with the secret religiousimpression already implanted in their minds; then, having broughttogether the lieutenant-generals and tribunes, and having openlyexpounded to them the commands of the gods, they settle amongthemselves, lest the consul's voluntary death should intimidate the armyin the field, that on which side soever the Roman army should commenceto give way, the consul in that quarter should devote himself for theRoman people and the Quirites. In this consultation it was alsosuggested, that if ever on any occasion any war had been conducted withstrict discipline, then indeed military discipline should be reduced tothe ancient standard. What excited their attention particularly was,that they had to contend against Latins, who coincided with themselvesin language, manners, in the same kind of arms, and more especially inmilitary institutions; soldiers had been mixed with soldiers, centurionswith centurions, tribunes with tribunes, as comrades and colleagues, inthe same armies, and often in the same companies. Lest in consequence ofthis the soldiers should be involved in any mistake, the consuls issueorders that no one should fight against an enemy out of his post."Book 8,Chapter 7,"It happened that among the other prefects of the troops, who had beensent out in all directions to reconnoitre, Titus Manlius, the consul'sson, came with his troop to the back of the enemy's camp, so near thathe was scarcely distant a dart's throw from the next post. In that placewere some Tusculan cavalry; they were commanded by Geminus Metius, a mandistinguished among his countrymen both by birth and exploits. When herecognised the Roman cavalry, and conspicuous among them the consul'sson marching at their head, (for they were all known to each other,especially the men of note,) ""Romans, are ye going to wage war with theLatins and allies with a single troop. What in the interim will theconsuls, what will the two consular armies be doing?"" ""They will be herein good time,"" says Manlius, ""and with them will be Jupiter himself, asa witness of the treaties violated by you, who is stronger and morepowerful. If we fought at the lake Regillus until you had quite enough,here also we shall so act, that a line of battle and an encounter withus may afford you no very great gratification."" In reply to this,Geminus, advancing some distance from his own party, says, ""Do youchoose then, until that day arrives on which you are to put your armiesin motion with such mighty labour, to enter the lists with me, that fromthe result of a contest between us both, it may be seen how much a Latinexcels a Roman horseman?"" Either resentment, or shame at declining thecontest, or the invincible power of fate, arouses the determined spiritof the youth. Forgetful therefore of his father's command, and theconsul's edict, he is driven headlong to that contest, in which it madenot much difference whether he conquered or was conquered. The otherhorsemen being removed to a distance as if to witness the sight, in thespace of clear ground which lay between them they spurred on theirhorses against each other; and when they were together in fierceencounter, the spear of Manlius passed over the helmet of hisantagonist, that of Metius across the neck of the other's horse. Thenwheeling round their horses, when Manlius arose to repeat the blow, hefixed his javelin between the ears of his opponent's horse. When, by thepain of this wound, the horse, having raised his fore-feet on high,tossed his head with great violence, he shook off his rider, whom, whenhe was raising himself from the severe fall, by leaning on his spear andbuckler, Manlius pierced through the throat, so that the steel passedout through the ribs, and pinned him to the earth; and having collectedthe spoils, he returned to his own party, and with his troop, who wereexulting with joy, he proceeds to the camp, and thence to the general'stent to his father, ignorant of what awaited him, whether praise orpunishment had been merited. ""Father,"" says he, ""that all may trulyrepresent me as sprung from your blood; when challenged, I slew myadversary, and have taken from him these equestrian spoils."" When theconsul heard this, immediately turning away from his son, he ordered anassembly to be summoned by sound of trumpet. When these assembled ingreat numbers, ""Since you, Titus Manlius,"" says he, ""revering neitherthe consular power nor a father's majesty, have fought against the enemyout of your post contrary to our orders, and, as far as in you lay, havesubverted military discipline, by which the Roman power has stood tothis day, and have brought me to this necessity, that I must eitherforget the republic, or myself and mine; we shall expiate our owntransgressions rather than the republic should sustain so serious a lossfor our misdeeds. We shall be a melancholy example, but a profitableone, to the youth of future ages. As for me, both the natural affectionfor my children, as well as that instance of bravery which has led youastray by the false notion of honour, affects me for you. But sinceeither the authority of consuls is to be established by your death, orby your forgiveness to be for ever annulled; I do not think that evenyou, if you have any of our blood in you, will refuse to restore, byyour punishment, the military discipline which has been subverted byyour misconduct. Go, lictor, bind him to the stake."" All becamemotionless, more through fear than discipline, astounded by so cruel anorder, each looking on the axe as if drawn against himself. Thereforewhen they stood in profound silence, suddenly, when the blood spoutedfrom his severed neck, their minds recovering, as it were, from a stateof stupefaction, then their voices arose together in free expressions ofcomplaint, so that they spared neither lamentations nor execrations: andthe body of the youth, being covered with the spoils, was burned on apile erected outside the rampart, with all the military zeal with whichany funeral could be celebrated: and Manlian orders were considered withhorror, not only for the present, but of the most austere severity forfuture times."Book 8,Chapter 8,"The severity of the punishment however rendered the soldiers moreobedient to the general; and besides that the guards and watches and theregulation of the posts were every where more strictly attended to, suchseverity was also profitable in the final struggle when they came intothe field of battle. But the battle was very like to a civil war; sovery similar was every thing among the Romans and Latins, except withrespect to courage. The Romans formerly used targets; afterwards, whenthey began to receive pay, they made shields instead of targets; andwhat before constituted phalanxes similar to the Macedonian, afterwardsbecame a line drawn up in distinct companies. At length they weredivided into several centuries. A century contained sixty soldiers, twocenturions, and one standard-bearer. The spearmen (hastati) formed thefirst line in fifteen companies, with small intervals between them: acompany had twenty light-armed soldiers, the rest wearing shields; thosewere called light who carried only a spear and short iron javelins.This, which constituted the van in the field of battle, contained theyouth in early bloom advancing towards the age of service. Next followedmen of more robust age, in the same number of companies, who were calledprincipes, all wearing shields, and distinguished by the completestarmour. This band of thirty companies they called antepilani, becausethere were fifteen others placed behind them with the standards; ofwhich each company consisted of three divisions, and the first divisionof each they called a pilus. Each company consisted of three ensigns,and contained one hundred and eighty-six men. The first ensign was atthe head of the Triarii, veteran soldiers of tried bravery; the second,at the head of the Rorarii, men whose ability was less by reason oftheir age and course of service; the third, at the head of the Accensi,a body in whom very little confidence was reposed. For this reason alsothey were thrown back to the rear. When the army was marshalledaccording to this arrangement, the spearmen first commenced the fight.If the spearmen were unable to repulse the enemy, they retreatedleisurely, and were received by the principes into the intervals of theranks. The fight then devolved on the principes; the spearmen followed.The Triarii continued kneeling behind the ensigns, their left legextended forward, holding their shields resting on their shoulders, andtheir spears fixed in the ground, with the points erect, so that theirline bristled as if enclosed by a rampart. If the principes also did notmake sufficient impression in the fight, they retreated slowly from thefront to the Triarii. Hence, when a difficulty is felt, ""Matters havecome to the Triarii,"" became a usual proverb. The Triarii rising up,after receiving the principes and spearmen into the intervals betweentheir ranks, immediately closing their files, shut up as it were theopenings; and in one compact body fell upon the enemy, no other hopebeing now left: that was the most formidable circumstance to the enemy,when having pursued them as vanquished, they beheld a new line suddenlystarting up, increased also in strength. In general about four legionswere raised, each consisting of five thousand infantry and three hundredhorse. As many more were added from the Latin levy, who were at thattime enemies to the Romans, and drew up their line after the samemanner; and they knew that unless the ranks were disturbed they wouldhave to engage not only standard with standard, spearmen with spearmen,principes with principes, but centurion also with centurion. There wereamong the veterans two first centurions in either army, the Roman by nomeans possessing bodily strength, but a brave man, and experienced inthe service; the Latin powerful in bodily strength, and a first-ratewarrior; they were very well known to each other, because they hadalways held equal rank. The Roman, somewhat diffident of his strength,had at Rome obtained permission from the consuls, to select any one whomhe wished, his own subcenturion, to protect him from the one destined tobe his adversary; and this youth being opposed to him in the battle,obtained the victory over the Latin centurion. They came to anengagement not far from the foot of Mount Vesuvius, where the road ledto the Veseris."Book 8,Chapter 9,"The Roman consuls, before they marched out their armies to the field,offered sacrifices. The aruspex is said to have shown to Decius the headof the liver wounded on the side relating to himself, in other respectsthe victim was acceptable to the gods; whilst Manlius obtained highlyfavourable omens from his sacrifice. ""But all is well,"" says Decius, ""ifmy colleague has offered an acceptable sacrifice."" The ranks being drawnup in the order already described, they marched forth to battle. Manliuscommanded the right, Decius the left wing. At first the action wasconducted with equal strength on both sides, and with the same ardentcourage. Afterwards the Roman spearmen on the left wing, not sustainingthe violent assault of the Latins, betook themselves to the principes.In this state of trepidation the consul Decius cries out with a loudvoice to Marcus Valerius, ""Valerius, we have need of the aid of thegods. Come, as public pontiff of the Roman people, dictate to me thewords in which I may devote myself for the legions."" The pontiffdirected him to take the gown called pr¾texta, and with his head coveredand his hand thrust out under the gown to the chin, standing upon aspear placed under his feet, to say these words: ""Janus, Jupiter, fatherMars, Quirinus, Bellona, ye Lares, ye gods Novensiles,[171] ye godsIndigetes, ye divinities, under whose power we and our enemies are, andye dii Manes, I pray you, I adore you, I ask your favour, that you wouldprosperously grant strength and victory to the Roman people, theQuirites; and that ye may affect the enemies of the Roman people, theQuirites, with terror, dismay, and death. In such manner as I haveexpressed in words, so do I devote the legions and auxiliaries of theenemy, together with myself, to the dii Manes and to Earth for therepublic of the Quirites, for the army, legions, auxiliaries of theRoman people, the Quirites."" Having uttered this prayer, he orders thelictors to go to Titus Manlius, and without delay to announce to hiscolleague that he had devoted himself for the army. He, girding himselfin a Gabine cincture, and fully armed, mounted his horse, and rushedinto the midst of the enemy. He was observed by both armies to present amore majestic appearance than human, as one sent from heaven as anexpiation of all the wrath of the gods, to transfer to the enemydestruction turned away from his own side: accordingly, all the terrorand panic being carried along with him, at first disturbed thebattalions of the Latins, then completely pervaded their entire line.This was most evident, because, in whatever direction he was carriedwith his horse, there they became panic-stricken, as if struck by somepestilential constellation; but when he fell overwhelmed with darts,instantly the cohorts of the Latins, thrown into manifest consternation,took to flight, leaving a void to a considerable extent. At the sametime also the Romans, their minds being freed from religious dread,exerting themselves as if the signal was then given for the first time,commenced to fight with renewed ardour. For the Rorarii also pushedforward among the antepilani, and added strength to the spearmen andprincipes, and the Triarii resting on the right knee awaited theconsul's nod to rise up."Book 8,Chapter 10,"Afterwards, as the contest proceeded, when the superior numbers ofthe Latins had the advantage in some places, the consul, Manlius, onhearing the circumstance of his colleague's death, after he had, as wasright and just, honoured his so glorious a death with tears, as well aswith praises so well merited, hesitated, for a little time, whether itwas yet time for the Triarii to rise; then judging it better that theyshould be kept fresh for the decisive blow, he ordered the Accensi toadvance from the rear before the standards. When they moved forward, theLatins immediately called up their Triarii, as if their opponents haddone the same thing: who, when they had by desperate fighting for aconsiderable time both fatigued themselves, and had either broken orblunted their spears, and were, however, beating back their adversaries,thinking that the battle was now nearly decided, and that they had cometo the last line; then the consul calls to the Triarii, ""Arise now,fresh as ye are, against men now wearied, mindful of your country andparents, your wives and children; mindful of your consul who hassubmitted to death to insure your victory."" When the Triarii arose,fresh as they were, with their arms glittering, a new line whichappeared unexpectedly, receiving the antepilani into the intervalsbetween the ranks, raised a shout, and broke through the first line ofthe Latins; and goading their faces, after cutting down those whoconstituted their principal strength, they passed almost intact throughthe other companies, with such slaughter that they scarcely left onefourth of the enemy. The Samnites also, drawn up at a distance at thefoot of the mountain, struck terror into the Latins. But of all, whethercitizens or allies, the principal praise for that action was due to theconsuls; the one of whom turned on himself alone all the threats anddangers (denounced) by the divinities of heaven and hell; the otherevinced such valour and such judgment in the battle, that it wasuniversally agreed among both the Romans and Latins who have transmittedto posterity an account of the battle, that, on whichever side TitusManlius held the command, the victory must belong to that. The Latins intheir flight betook themselves to Minturn¾. Immediately after the battlethe camp was taken, and great numbers still alive were surprisedtherein, chiefly Campanians. Night surprised them in their search, andprevented the body of Decius from being discovered on that day. On theday after it was found amid vast heaps of slaughtered enemies, piercedwith a great number of darts, and his funeral was solemnized under thedirection of his colleague, in a manner suited to his death. It seemsright to add here, that it is lawful for a consul, a dictator, and apr¾tor, when he devotes the legions of the enemy, to devote not himselfparticularly, but whatever citizen he may choose out of a Roman legionregularly enrolled: if the person who has been devoted die, the matteris duly performed; if he do not perish, then an image, seven feet highor more, must be buried in the ground, and a victim slain, as anexpiation. Where that image shall be buried, there it is not lawful thata Roman magistrate should pass. But if he wish to devote himself, asDecius did, unless he who has devoted himself die, he shall not withpropriety perform any act of religion regarding either himself or thepublic. Should he wish to devote his arms to Vulcan or to any other god,he has a right, whether he shall please, by a victim, or in any othermanner. It is not proper that the enemy should get possession of theweapon, on which the consul, standing, pronounced the imprecation: ifthey should get possession of it, then an expiation must be made to Marsby the sacrifices called the Suove-taurilia. Although the memory ofevery divine and human custom has been obliterated, in consequence ofpreferring what is modern and foreign to that which is ancient andbelonging to our own country, I deemed it not irrelevant to relate theparticulars even in the very terms used, as they have been handed downand expressed."Book 8,Chapter 11," I find it stated in some writers, that the Samnites, having awaitedthe issue of the battle, came at length with support to the Romans afterthe battle was over. Also aid from Lavinium, whilst they wasted time indeliberating, was at length sent to the Latins after they had beenvanquished. And when the first standards and part of the army justissued from the gates, news being brought of the defeat of the Latins,they faced about and returned back to the city; on which occasion theysay that their pr¾tor, Milionius, observed, that ""for so very short ajourney a high price must be paid to the Romans."" Such of the Latins assurvived the battle, after being scattered over many roads, collectedthemselves into a body, and found refuge in the city of Vescia. Theretheir general, Numisius, insisted in their counsels, that ""the trulycommon fortune of war had prostrated both armies by equal losses, andthat only the name of victory rested with the Romans; that in otherrespects they too shared the lot of defeated persons; the two pavilionsof the consuls were polluted; one by the murder committed on a son, theother by the blood of a devoted consul; that their army was cut down inevery direction; their spearmen and principes were cut down; great havocwas made before the standards and behind them; the Triarii at lengthrestored their cause. Though the forces of the Latins were cut down inan equal proportion, yet for reinforcements, Latium or the Volscianswere nearer than Rome. Wherefore, if they thought well of it, he wouldspeedily call out the youth from the Latin and Volscian states, andwould return to Capua with a determined army, and by his unexpectedarrival strike dismay among the Romans, who were expecting nothing lessthan battle."" Deceptive letters being sent around Latium and theVolscian nation, a tumultuary army, hastily raised from all quarters,was assembled, for as they had not been present at the battle, they weremore disposed to believe on slight grounds. This army the consulTorquatus met at Trisanum, a place between Sinuessa and Minturn¾. Beforea place was selected for a camp, the baggage on both sides being piledup in a heap, they fought and terminated the war; for so impaired wastheir strength, that all the Latins surrendered themselves to theconsul, who was leading his victorious army to lay waste their lands,and the Campanians followed the example of this surrender. Latium andCapua were fined some land. The Latin with the addition of thePrivernian land; and the Falernian land, which had belonged to thepeople of Campania, as far as the river Vulturnus, is all distributed tothe commons of Rome. In the Latin land two acres a man were assigned, sothat they should receive an additional three-fourths of an acre from thePrivernian land; in the Falernian land three acres were assigned, onefourth of an acre being further added, in consideration of the distance.Of the Latins the Laurentians were exempted from punishment, as also thehorsemen of the Campanians, because they had not revolted. An order wasissued that the treaty should be renewed with the Laurentians; and it isrenewed every year since, on the tenth day after the Latin festival. Therights of citizenship were granted to the Campanian horsemen; and thatit might serve as a memorial, they hung up a brazen tablet in the templeof Castor at Rome. The Campanian state was also enjoined to pay them ayearly stipend of four hundred and fifty denarii each; their numberamounted to one thousand six hundred."Book 8,Chapter 12,"ributed according to the deserts of each, Titus Manlius returned toRome: on his approach it appears that the aged only went forth to meethim; and that the young men, both then, and all his life after, detestedand cursed him. The Antians made incursions on the territories of Ostia,Ardea, and Solonia. The consul Manlius, because he was unable by reasonof his health to conduct that war, nominated as dictator Lucius PapiriusCrassus, who then happened to be pr¾tor; by him Lucius Papirius Cursorwas appointed master of the horse. Nothing worthy of mention wasperformed against the Antians by the dictator, although he had kept astanding camp for several months in the Antian territory. To a yearsignalized by a victory over so many and such powerful states, furtherby the illustrious death of one of the consuls, as well as by theunrelenting, though memorable, severity of command in the other, theresucceeded as consuls Titus ®milius Mamercinus and Quintus PubliliusPhilo; neither to a similar opportunity of exploits, and they themselvesbeing mindful rather of their own interests as well as of those of theparties in the state, than of the interests of their country. Theyrouted on the plains of Ferentinum, and stripped of their camp, theLatins, who, in resentment of the land they had lost, took up armsagain. Publilius, under whose guidance and auspices the action had beenfought, receiving the submission of the Latin states, who had lost agreat many of their young men there, ®milius marched the army to Pedum.The people of Pedum were supported by the states of Tibur, Pr¾neste, andVelitr¾; auxiliaries had also come from Lanuvium and Antium. Where,though the Romans had the advantage in several engagements, still theentire labour remained at the city of Pedum itself and at the camp ofthe allied states, which was adjoining the city: suddenly leaving thewar unfinished, because he heard that a triumph was decreed to hiscolleague, he himself also returned to Rome to demand a triumph before avictory had been obtained. The senate displeased by this ambitiousconduct, and refusing a triumph unless Pedum was either taken or shouldsurrender, ®milius, alienated from the senate in consequence of thisact, administered the remainder of the consulship like to a seditioustribuneship. For, as long as he was consul, he neither ceased tocriminate the patricians to the people, his colleague by no meansinterfering, because he himself also was a plebeian; (the scantydistribution of the land among the commons in the Latin and Falernianterritory afforded the groundwork of the criminations;) and when thesenate, wishing to put an end to the administration of the consuls,ordered a dictator to be nominated against the Latins, who were again inarms, ®milius, to whom the fasces then belonged, nominated his colleaguedictator; by him Junius Brutus was constituted master of the horse. Thedictatorship was popular, both in consequence of his discoursescontaining invectives against the patricians, and because he passedthree laws, most advantageous to the commons, and injurious to thenobility; one, that the orders of the commons should be binding on allthe Romans; another, that the patricians should, before the suffragescommenced, declare their approbation of the laws which should be passedin the assemblies of the centuries; the third, that one at least of thecensors should be elected from the commons, as they had already gone sofar as that it was lawful that both the consuls should be plebeians. Thepatricians considered that more of detriment had been sustained on thatyear from the consuls and dictator than was counterbalanced by theirsuccess and achievements abroad."Book 8,Chapter 13,"On the following year, Lucius Furius Camillus and Caius M¾nius wereconsuls, in order that the neglect of his duty by ®milius, the consul ofthe preceding year, might be rendered more markedly reproachful, thesenate loudly urge that Pedum should be assailed with arms, men, andevery kind of force, and be demolished; and the new consuls, beingforced to give that matter the precedence of all others, set out on thatexpedition. The state of affairs was now such in Latium, that they couldno longer submit to either war or peace. For war they were deficient inresources; they spurned at peace through resentment for the loss oftheir land. It seemed necessary therefore to steer a middle course, tokeep within their towns, so that the Romans by being provoked might haveno pretext for hostilities; and that if the siege of any town should beannounced to them, aid should be sent from every quarter from all thestates. And still the people of Pedum were aided by only a very fewstates. The Tiburtians and Pr¾nestines, whose territory lay nearest,came to Pedum. M¾nius suddenly making an attack, defeated theAricinians, and Lanuvians, and Veliternians, at the river Astura, theVolscians of Antium forming a junction with them. The Tiburtian, far thestrongest body, Camillus engages at Pedum, encountering much greaterdifficulty, though with a result equally successful. A sudden sally ofthe townsmen during the battle chiefly occasioned confusion: Camillus,turning on these with a part of his army, not only drove them withintheir walls, but on the very same day, after he had discomfitedthemselves and their auxiliaries, he took the town by scalade. It wasthen resolved to lead round with greater energy and spirit hisvictorious army from the storming of a single city to the entireconquest of Latium. Nor did they stop until they reduced all Latium,either by storming, or by becoming masters of the cities one after theother by capitulation. Then, disposing garrisons in the towns which theyhad taken, they departed to Rome to a triumph universally admitted tobe due to them. To the triumph was added the honour of having equestrianstatues erected to them in the forum, a compliment very unusual at thatperiod. Before they commenced holding the meeting for the election ofthe consuls for the ensuing year, Camillus moved the senate concerningthe Latin states, and spoke thus: ""Conscript fathers, that which was tobe done by war and arms in Latium has now been fully accomplished by thebounty of the gods and the valour of the soldiers. The armies of theenemy have been cut down at Pedum and the Astura. All the Latin towns,and Antium belonging to the Volscians, either taken by storm, orreceived into surrender, are occupied by your garrisons. It now remainsto be considered, since they annoy us by their repeated rebellions, howwe may keep them in quiet submission and in the observance of perpetualpeace. The immortal gods have put the determination of this matter socompletely in your power, that they have placed it at your optionwhether Latium is to exist henceforward or not. Ye can therefore insureto yourselves perpetual peace, as far as regards the Latins, either byadopting severe or lenient measures. Do ye choose to adopt cruel conducttowards people who have surrendered and have been conquered? Ye maydestroy all Latium, make a vast desert of a place whence, in many andserious wars, ye have often made use of an excellent army of allies. Doyou wish, according to the example of your ancestors, to augment theRoman state by admitting the vanquished among your citizens? Materialsfor extending your power by the highest glory are at hand. Thatgovernment is certainly by far the most secure, which the subjects feela pleasure in obeying. But whatever determination ye wish to come to, itis necessary that it be speedy. So many states have ye in a state ofsuspense between hope and fear; and it is necessary that you bedischarged as soon as possible of your solicitude about them, and thattheir minds, whilst they are still in a state of insensibility fromuncertainty, be at once impressed either by punishment or clemency. Itwas our duty to bring matters to such a pass that you may have fullpower to deliberate on every matter; yours to decide what is mostexpedient to yourselves and the commonwealth."""Book 8,Chapter 14,"The principal members of the senate applauded the consul'sstatement of the business on the whole; but said that ""as the stateswere differently circumstanced, that their plan might be readilyadjusted so that it might be determined according to the desert of each,if they should put the question regarding each state specifically."" Thequestion was therefore so put regarding each separately and a decreepast. To the Lanuvians the right of citizenship was granted, and theexercise of their religious rights was restored to them with thisprovision, that the temple and grove of Juno Sospita should be commonbetween the Lanuvian burghers and the Roman people. The Aricians,Nomentans, and Pedans were admitted into the number of citizens on thesame terms as the Lanuvians. To the Tusculans the rights of citizenshipwhich they already possessed were continued; and the crime of rebellionwas turned from disaffection on public grounds against a fewinstigators. On the Veliternians, Roman citizens of long standing,measures of great severity were inflicted because they had so oftenrebelled; their walls were razed, and their senate removed from thence,and they were ordered to dwell on the other side of the Tiber, so thatthe fine of any individual who should be caught on the hither side ofthat river should amount to one thousand _asses_; and that the personwho had apprehended him, should not discharge his prisoner fromconfinement, until the money was paid down. Into the land of thesenators colonists were sent; from the additions of which Velitr¾recovered its appearance of former populousness. A new colony was alsosent to Antium, with this provision, that if the Antians desired to beenrolled as colonists, permission to that effect should be granted.Their ships of war were removed from thence, and the people of Antiumwere interdicted the sea, and the rights of citizenship were grantedthem. The Tiburtians and Pr¾nestines were amerced in some land, not onlyon account of the recent guilt of the rebellion, which was common tothem with the other Latins; but also because, from their dislike to theRoman government, they had formerly associated in arms with the Gauls, anation of savages. From the other Latin states they took away theprivileges of intermarriage, commerce, and of holding meetings. To theCampanians, in compliment to their horsemen, because they had refused tojoin in rebellion with the Latins, and to the Fundans and Formians,because the passage through their territories had been always secure andpeaceful, the freedom of the state was granted with the right ofsuffrage. It was determined that the people of Cum¾ and Suessula shouldhave the same rights and be on the same footing as Capua. Of the shipsof the Antians some were drawn up to the docks at Rome, some wereburned, and with the prows of these a pulpit built in the forum wasordered to be decorated; and that temple was called Rostra."Book 8,Chapter 15,"During the consulship of Caius Sulpicius Longus and Publius ®liusP¾tus, when the Roman power not more than the kindly feeling engenderedby acts of kindness diffused the blessings of peace among all parties, awar broke out between the Sidicinians and Auruncans. The Auruncanshaving been admitted into alliance on the occasion of theirsurrendering, had since that period made no disturbance; accordinglythey had a juster pretext for seeking aid from the Romans. But beforethe consuls led forth their army from the city, (for the senate hadordered the Auruncans to be defended,) intelligence is brought that theAuruncans deserted their town through fear, and flying with their wivesand children, that they fortified Suessa, which is now called Aurunca;that their ancient walls and city were demolished by the Sidicinians.The senate being in consequence incensed against the consuls, by whosedelays the allies had been betrayed, ordered a dictator to be created.Caius Claudius Regillensis was appointed, and he nominated CaiusClaudius Hortator as master of the horse. A scruple afterwards aroseconcerning the dictator; and when the augurs declared that he seemed tohave been created under an informality, the dictator and the master ofthe horse laid down their office. This year Minucia, a vestal, at firstsuspected on account of her dress being more elegant than was becoming,afterwards being arraigned before the pontiffs on the testimony of aslave, after she had been ordered by their decree to abstain frommeddling in sacred rites, and to keep her slaves under her own power,when brought to trial, was buried alive at the Colline gate, on theright of the causeway, in the field of wickedness. I suppose that namewas given to the place from her crime. On the same year QuintusPublilius Philo was the first of the plebeians elected pr¾tor, beingopposed by Sulpicius the consul, who refused to take any notice of himas a candidate; the senate, as they had not succeeded on that ground inthe case of the highest offices, being less earnest with respect to thepr¾torship."Book 8,Chapter 16,"The following year, Lucius Papirius Crassus and K¾so Duilius beingconsuls, was distinguished by a war with the Ausonians, as being newrather than important. This people inhabited the city Cales; they hadunited their arms with their neighbours the Sidicinians; and the army ofthe two states being defeated in one battle scarcely worthy of record,was induced to take to flight the earlier in consequence of theproximity of the cities, and the more sheltered on their flight. Nor didthe senate, however, discontinue their attention to that war, becausethe Sidicinians had now so often taken up arms either as principals, orhad afforded aid to those who did so, or had been the cause ofhostilities. Accordingly they exerted themselves with all their might,to raise to the consulship for the fourth time, Marcus Valerius Corvus,the greatest general of that day. To Corvus was added Marcus AtiliusRegulus as colleague; and lest any disappointment might by any chanceoccur, a request was made of the consuls, that, without drawing lots,that province might be assigned to Corvus. Receiving the victorious armyfrom the former consuls, proceeding to Cales, whence the war hadoriginated, after he had, at the first shout and onset, routed theenemy, who were disheartened by the recollection also of the formerengagement, he set about attacking the town itself. And such was theardour of the soldiers, that they wished to advance immediately up tothe walls, and strenuously asserted that they would scale them. Corvus,because that was a hazardous undertaking, wished to accomplish hisobject rather by the labour than the risk of his men. Accordingly heformed a rampart, prepared his vine¾, and advanced towers up to thewalls; but an opportunity which accidentally presented itself, preventedthe occasion for them. For Marcius Fabius, a Roman prisoner, when,having broken his chains during the inattention of his guards on afestival day, suspending himself by means of a rope which was fastenedto a battlement of the wall, he let himself down by the hands, persuadedthe general to make an assault on the enemy whilst stupified by wine andfeasting; nor were the Ausonians, together with their city, capturedwith greater difficulty than they had been routed in the field. A greatamount of booty was obtained; and a garrison being stationed at Cales,the legions were marched back to Rome. The consul triumphed in pursuanceof a decree of the senate; and that Atilius might not be without a shareof glory, both the consuls were ordered to lead the army against theSidicinians. But first, in conformity with a decree of the senate, theynominated as dictator for the purpose of holding the elections, Lucius®milius Mamercinus; he named Quintus Publilius Philo his master of thehorse. The dictator presiding at the elections, Titus Veturius andSpurius Postumius were elected consuls. Though a part of the war withthe Sidicinians still remained; yet that they might anticipate, by anact of kindness, the wishes of the commons, they proposed about sendinga colony to Cales; and a decree of the senate being passed that twothousand five hundred men should be enrolled for that purpose, theyappointed K¾so Duilius, Titus Quinctius, and Marcus Fabius commissionersfor conducting the colony and distributing the land."Book 8,Chapter 17,"The new consuls then, recovering the army from their predecessors,entered the enemy's territories and carried their depredations up to thewalls and the city. There because the Sidicinians, who had raised anumerous army, seemed determined to fight vigorously for their lasthope, and a report existed that Samnium also was preparing forhostilities, Publius Cornelius Rufinus was created dictator by theconsuls in pursuance of a decree of the senate; Marcus Antonius wasnominated master of the horse. A scruple afterwards arose that they wereelected under an informality: and they laid down their office; andbecause a pestilence followed, recourse was had to an interregnum, as ifall the auspices had been infected by that irregularity. By MarcusValerius Corvus, the fifth interrex from the commencement of theinterregnum, Aulus Cornelius a second time, and Cneius Domitius wereelected consuls. Things being now tranquil, the rumour of a Gallic warhad the effect of a real outbreak, so that they were determined that adictator should be nominated. Marcus Papirius Crassus was nominated, andPublius Valerius Publicola master of the horse. And when the levy wasconducted by them with more activity than was deemed necessary in thecase of neighbouring wars, scouts were sent out and brought word, thatthere was perfect quiet with the Gauls in every direction. It wassuspected that Samnium also was now for the second year in a state ofdisturbance in consequence of their entertaining new designs: hence theRoman troops were not withdrawn from the Sidicinian territory. But ahostile attack made by Alexander of Epirus on the Lucanians drew awaythe attention of the Samnites to another quarter; these two nationsfought a pitched battle against the king, as he was making a descent onthe district adjoining P¾stum. Alexander, having come off victorious inthat contest, concluded a peace with the Romans; with what fidelity hewould have kept it, if his other projects had been equally successful,is uncertain. The same year the census was performed, and the newcitizens were rated; on their account the M¾scian and Scaptian tribeswere added: the censors who added them were Quintus Publilius Philo andSpurius Postumius. The Acerrans were enrolled as Romans, in conformitywith a law introduced by the pr¾tor, Lucius Papirius, by which the rightof citizenship with the privilege of suffrage was conferred. These werethe transactions at home and abroad during that year."Book 8,Chapter 18,"The following year was disastrous, whether by the intemperature ofthe air, or by human guilt, Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Caius Valeriusbeing consuls. I find in the annals Flaccus and Potitus variously givenas the surname of the consul; but in this it is of little consequencewhich is the true one. I would heartily wish that this other accountwere a false one, (nor indeed do all writers mention it,) viz. thatthose persons, whose death rendered the year signal for the pestilence,were carried off by poison. The circumstance however must be stated asit is handed down to us, that I may not detract from the credit of anywriter. When the principal persons of the state were dying of similardiseases, and all generally with the same result, a certain maid-servantundertook, before Quintius Fabius Maximus, curule ¾dile, to discover thecause of the public malady, provided the public faith would be given toher by him, that the discovery should not be made detrimental to her.Fabius immediately lays the matter before the consuls, and the consulsbefore the senate, and with the concurrence of that order the publicfaith was pledged to the informer. It was then disclosed that the statewas afflicted by the wickedness of certain women, and that certainmatrons were preparing those poisonous drugs; and if they wished tofollow her forthwith, they might be detected in the very fact. Havingfollowed the informer, they found women preparing certain drugs, andothers of the same kind laid up. These being brought into the forum, andseveral matrons, to the number of twenty, in whose possession they hadbeen detected, being summoned by the beadle, two of them, Cornelia andSergia, both of patrician rank, maintaining that these drugs werewholesome, were directed by the informer who confronted them to drinksome, that they might convict her of having stated what was false;having taken time to confer together, when, the crowd being removed,they referred the matter to the other matrons in the open view of all;they also not refusing to drink, they all drank off the preparation, andperished by their own wicked device. Their attendants being instantlyseized, informed against a great number of matrons, of whom to thenumber of one hundred and seventy were condemned. Nor up to that day wasthere ever an inquiry made at Rome concerning poisoning. Thecircumstance was considered a prodigy; and seemed the act rather ofinsane persons than of persons depraved by guilt. Wherefore mentionhaving been found in the annals, that formerly in the secessions of thecommons the nail had been driven by the dictator, and that the minds ofthe people, distracted by discord, had been restored to a sane state, itwas determined that a dictator should be nominated for the purpose ofdriving the nail. Cneius Quinctilius being nominated, appointed LuciusValerius master of the horse, who, as soon as the nail was driven,abdicated their offices."Book 8,Chapter 19,"Lucius Papirius Crassus a second time, and Lucius Plautius Vennowere elected consuls; at the commencement of which year ambassadors cameto Rome from the Fabraternians, a Volscian people, and from theLucanians, soliciting to be admitted into alliance: [promising] that ifthey were defended from the arms of the Samnites, they would continue infidelity and obedience under the government of the Roman people.Ambassadors were then sent by the senate; and the Samnites were directedto withhold all violence from the territories of those states; and thisembassy proved effectual not so much because the Samnites were desirousof peace, as because they were not prepared for war. The same year a warbroke out with the people of Privernum; in which the people of Fundiwere their supporters, their leader also being a Fundanian, VitruviusVaccus; a man of distinction not only at home, but in Rome also. He hada house on the Palatine hill, which, after the building was razed andthe ground thrown open, was called the Vacciprata. Lucius Papiriushaving set out to oppose him whilst devastating extensively thedistricts of Setia, Norba, and Cora, posted himself at no great distancefrom his camp. Vitruvius neither adopted the prudent resolution toenclose himself with his trenches against an enemy his superior instrength, nor had he sufficient courage to engage at any great distancefrom his camp. When his army had scarcely got out of the gate of thecamp, and his soldiers were looking backwards to flight rather than tobattle or the enemy, he enters on an engagement without judgment orboldness; and as he was conquered by a very slight effort andunequivocally, so did he by the very shortness of the distance, and bythe facility of his retreat into the camp so near at hand, protect hissoldiers without difficulty from much loss; and scarcely were any slainin the engagement itself, and but few in the confusion of the flight inthe rear, whilst they were making their way into the camp; and as soonas it was dark they repaired to Privernum in trepidation, so that theymight protect themselves rather by walls than by a rampart. Plautius,the other consul, after laying waste the lands in every direction anddriving off the spoil, leads his army into the Fundanian territory. Thesenate of the Fundanians met him as he was entering their borders; theydeclare that ""they had not come to intercede in behalf of Vitruvius orthose who followed his faction, but in behalf of the people of Fundi,whose exemption from any blame in the war had been proved by Vitruviushimself, when he made Privernum his place of retreat, and not his nativecountry, Fundi. At Privernum, therefore, the enemies of the Roman peoplewere to be looked for, and punished, who revolted at the same time fromthe Fundanians and the Romans, unmindful of both countries. That theFundanians were at peace, that they had Roman feelings and a gratefulrecollection of the political rights received. They entreated the consulto withhold war from an inoffensive people; their lands, city, their ownbodies and those of their wives and children, were, and ever should be,at the disposal of the Roman people."" The consul, having commended theFundanians, and despatched letters to Rome that the Fundanians hadpreserved their allegiance, turned his march to Privernum. Claudiusstates, that the consul first punished those who were at the head of theconspiracy; that three hundred and fifty of the conspirators were sentin chains to Rome; and that such submission was not received by thesenate, because they considered that the people of Fundi wished to comeoff with impunity by the punishment of needy and humble persons."Book 8,Chapter 20,"While the siege of Privernum was being conducted by the two consulararmies, one of the consuls was recalled to Rome, on account of theelections. This year gaols were first erected in the circus. While theattention of the public was still occupied by the Privernian war, analarming report of the Gauls being in arms, a matter scarcely everslighted by the senate, suddenly came on them. The new consuls,therefore, Lucius ®milius Mamercinus and Caius Plautius, on the calendsof July, the very day on which they entered into office, received ordersto settle the provinces immediately between themselves; and Mamercinus,to whom the Gallic war fell, was directed to levy troops, withoutadmitting any plea of immunity: nay, it is said, that even the rabble ofhandicrafts, and those of sedentary trades, of all the worst qualifiedfor military service, were called out; and a vast army was collected atVeii, in readiness to meet the Gauls. It was thought proper not toproceed to a greater distance, lest the enemy might by some other routearrive at the city without being observed. In the course of a few daysit being ascertained, on a careful inquiry, that every thing on thatside was quiet at the time; the whole force, which was to have opposedthe Gauls, was then turned against Privernum. Of the issue of thebusiness, there are two different accounts: some say, that the city wastaken by storm; and that Vitruvius fell alive into the hands [of theconquerors]: others maintain that the townsmen, to avoid the extremitiesof a storm, presenting the rod of peace, surrendered to the consul; andthat Vitruvius was delivered up by his troops. The senate, beingconsulted with respect to Vitruvius and the Privernians, sentdirections, that the consul Plautius should demolish the walls ofPrivernum, and, leaving a strong garrison there, come home to enjoy thehonour of a triumph; at the same time ordering that Vitruvius should bekept in prison, until the return of the consul, and that he should thenbe beaten with rods, and put to death. His house, which stood on thePalatine hill, they commanded to be razed to the ground, and his effectsto be devoted to Semo Sancus. With the money produced by the sale ofthem, brazen globes were formed, and placed in the chapel of Sancus,opposite to the temple of Quirinus. As to the senate of Privernum, itwas decreed, that every person who had continued to act as a senator ofPrivernum, after the revolt from the Romans, should reside on thefarther side of the Tiber, under the same restrictions as those ofVelitr¾. After the passing of these decrees, there was no furthermention of the Privernians, until Plautius had triumphed. After thetriumph, Vitruvius, with his accomplices, having been put to death, theconsul thought that all being now fully gratified by the sufferings ofthe guilty, allusion might be safely made to the business of thePrivernians, he spoke in the following manner: ""Conscript fathers, sincethe authors of the revolt have received, both from the immortal gods andfrom you, the punishment so well merited, what do ye judge proper to bedone with respect to the guiltless multitude? For my part, although myduty consists rather in collecting the opinions of others than inoffering my own, yet, when I reflect that the Privernians are situatedin the neighbourhood of the Samnites, our peace with whom is exceedinglyuncertain, I should wish, that as little ground of animosity as possiblemay be left between them and us."""Book 8,Chapter 21,"The affair naturally admitted of a diversity of opinions, each,agreeably to his particular temper, recommending either severity orlenity; matters were still further perplexed by one of the Privernianambassadors, more mindful of the prospects to which he had been born,than to the exigency of the present juncture: who being asked by one ofthe advocates for severity, ""What punishment he thought the Priverniansdeserved?"" answered, ""Such as those deserve who deem themselves worthyof liberty."" The consul observing, that, by this stubborn answer, thosewho were adverse to the cause of the Privernians were the moreexasperated against them, and wishing, by a question of favourableimport, to draw from him a more conciliating reply, said to him, ""Whatif we remit the punishment, in what manner may we expect that ye willobserve the peace which shall be established between us?"" He replied,""If the peace which ye grant us be a good one, both inviolable andeternal; if bad, of no long continuance."" Then indeed some exclaimed,that the Privernian menaced them, and not in ambiguous terms; and thatby such expressions peaceable states were incited to rebellion. But themore reasonable part of the senate interpreted his answers morefavourably, and said, that ""the words they had heard were those of aman, and of a free-man. Could it be believed that any people, or evenany individual, would remain, longer than necessity constrained, in asituation which he felt painful? That peace was faithfully observed,only when those at peace were voluntarily so; but that fidelity was notto be expected where they wished to establish slavery."" In this opinionthey were led to concur, principally, by the consul himself, whofrequently observed to the consulars, who had proposed the differentresolutions, in such a manner as to be heard by several, that ""surelythose men only who thought of nothing but liberty, were worthy of beingmade Romans."" They consequently both carried their cause in the senate;and, moreover, by direction of that body, a proposal was laid before thepeople, that the freedom of the state should be granted to thePrivernians. The same year a colony of three hundred was sent to Anxur,and received two acres of land each."Book 8,Chapter 22,"The year following, in which the consuls were Publius PlautiusProculus and Publius Cornelius Scapula, was remarkable for no onetransaction, civil or military, except the sending of a colony toFregell¾, a district which had belonged to the Sidicinians, andafterwards to the Volscians; and a distribution of meat to the people,made by Marcus Flavius, on occasion of the funeral of his mother. Therewere many who represented, that, under the appearance of doing honour tohis parent, a deserved recompence was made to the people, for havingacquitted him, when prosecuted by the ¾diles on a charge of havingdebauched a married woman. This distribution of meat intended as areturn for favours shown on the trial, proved also the means ofprocuring him the honour of a public office; for, at the next election,though absent, he was preferred before the candidates who solicited inperson the tribuneship of the commons. The city of Pal¾polis wassituated at no great distance from the spot where Neapolis now stands.The two cities were inhabited by one people: these came from Cum¾, andthe Cumans derive their origin from Chalcis in EubÏa. By means ofthe fleet in which they had been conveyed hither, they possessed greatpower on the coast of the sea, near which they dwelt. Having firstlanded on the islands of ®naria, and the Pithecus¾, they afterwardsventured to transfer their settlement to the continent. This state,relying both on their own strength, as well as on the treacherous natureof the alliance of the Samnites with the Romans; or, encouraged by thereport of a pestilence having attacked the city of Rome, committedvarious acts of hostility against the Romans settled in the Campanianand Falernian territories. Wherefore, in the succeeding consulate ofLucius Cornelius, and Quintus Publilius Philo a second time, heraldsbeing sent to Pal¾polis to demand satisfaction, when a haughty answerwas returned by these Greeks, a race more magnanimous in words than inaction, the people, in pursuance of the direction of the senate, orderedwar to be declared against the Pal¾politans. On settling the provincesbetween the consuls, the war against the Greeks fell to Publilius.Cornelius, with another army, was appointed to watch the Samnites ifthey should attempt any movement; but a report prevailed that they,anxiously expecting a revolt in Campania, intended to march their troopsthither; that was judged by Cornelius the properest station for him."Book 8,Chapter 23,"The senate received information, from both the consuls, that therewas very little hope of peace with the Samnites. Publilius informedthem, that two thousand soldiers from Nol¾, and four thousand of theSamnites, had been received into Pal¾polis, a measure rather forced onthe Greeks by the Nolans than agreeable to their inclination. Corneliuswrote, that a levy of troops had been ordered, that all Samnium was inmotion, and that the neighbouring states of Privernum, Fundi, andFormi¾, were openly solicited to join them. When in consequence it wasthought proper, that, before hostilities were commenced, ambassadorsshould be sent to the Samnites, an insolent answer is returned by them;they even went so far as to accuse the Romans of behaving injuriouslytowards them; but, nevertheless, they took pains to clear themselves ofthe charges made against them, asserting, that ""the Greeks were notassisted with either counsel or aid by their state, nor were theFundanians or Formians tampered with by them; for, if they were disposedto war, they had not the least reason to be diffident of their ownstrength. However, they could not dissemble, that it gave great offenceto the state of the Samnites, that Fregell¾, by them taken from theVolscians and demolished, should have been rebuilt by the Romans; andthat they should have established a colony within the territory of theSamnites, to which their colonists gave the name of Fregell¾. Thisinjury and affront, if not done away by the authors, they weredetermined themselves to remove, by every means in their power."" Whenone of the Roman ambassadors proposed to discuss the matter before theircommon allies and friends, their magistrate said, ""Why do we disguiseour sentiments? Romans, no conferences of ambassadors, nor arbitrationof any person whatever, can terminate our differences; but the plains ofCampania, in which we must meet; our arms and the common fortune of warwill settle the point. Let our armies, therefore, meet between Capua andSuessula; and there let us decide, whether the Samnite or the Romanshall hold the sovereignty of Italy."" To this the ambassadors of theRomans replied, ""that they would go, not whither their enemy called, butwhither their commanders should lead."" In the mean time, Publilius, byseizing an advantageous post between Pal¾polis and Neapolis, had cut offthat interchange of mutual aid, which they had hitherto afforded eachother, according as either place was hard pressed. Accordingly, whenboth the day of the elections approached, and as it was highlyinexpedient for the public interest that Publilius should be called awaywhen on the point of assailing the enemy's walls, and in dailyexpectation of gaining possession of their city, application was made tothe tribunes, to recommend to the people the passing of an order, thatPublilius Philo, when his year of office should expire, might continuein command, as pro-consul, until the war with the Greeks should befinished. A letter was despatched to Lucius Cornelius, with orders toname a dictator; for it was not thought proper that the consul should berecalled from the vigorous prosecution of the war now that he hadentered into Samnium. He nominated Marcus Claudius Marcellus, whoappointed Spurius Postumius master of the horse. The elections, however,were not held by the dictator, because it became a question whether hehad been appointed under an irregularity; and the augurs beingconsulted, pronounced that it appeared that the dictator's appointmentwas defective. The tribunes inveighed against this proceeding asdangerous and dishonourable; ""for it was not probable,"" they said, ""thatsuch defect could have been discovered, as the consul, rising in thenight, had nominated the dictator while every thing was still;[172] norhad the said consul in any of his letters, either public or private,made any mention of such a thing to any one; nor did any person whatevercome forward who said that he saw or heard any thing which could vitiatethe auspices. Neither could the augurs sitting at Rome divine whatinauspicious circumstance had occurred to the consul in the camp. Whodid not plainly perceive, that the dictator's being a plebeian, was thedefect which the augurs had discovered?"" These and other arguments wereurged in vain by the tribunes: the affair however ended in aninterregnum. At last, after the elections had been adjourned repeatedlyon one pretext or another, the fourteenth interrex, Lucius ®milius,elected consuls Caius P¾telius, and Lucius Papirius Mugillanus, orCursor, as I find him named in some annals."Book 8,Chapter 24,"It has been recorded, that in this year Alexandria in Egypt wasfounded; and that Alexander, king of Epirus, being slain by a Lucanianexile, verified in the circumstances of his death the prediction ofJupiter of Dodona. At the time when he was invited into Italy by theTarentines, a caution had been given him, ""to beware of the Acherusianwaters and the city Pandosia, for there were fixed the limits of hisdestiny."" For that reason he made the greater haste to pass over toItaly, in order to be at as great a distance as possible from the cityPandosia in Epirus, and the river Acheron, which, after flowing throughMolossis, runs into the lakes called Infernal, and is received into theThesprotian gulf. But, (as it frequently happens, that men, byendeavouring to shun their fate, run directly upon it,) after havingoften defeated the armies of Bruttium and Lucania, and taken Heraclea, acolony of the Tarentines, Consentia and Metapontum from the Lucanians,Terina from the Bruttians, and several other cities of the Messapiansand Lucanians; and having sent into Epirus three hundred illustriousfamilies, whom he intended to keep as hostages, he posted his troops onthree hills, which stood at a small distance from each other, not farfrom the city Pandosia, and close to the frontiers of the Bruttians andLucanians, in order that he might thence make incursions into every partof the enemy's country. At that time he kept about his person twohundred Lucanian exiles, as faithful attendants, but whose fidelity,according to the general disposition of people of that description, wasever ready to follow the changes of fortune. When continual rains spreadsuch an inundation over all the plains, as cut off from the threeseparate divisions of the army all means of mutual aid, the two parties,in neither of which the king was present, were suddenly attacked andoverpowered by the enemy, who, after putting them to the sword, employedtheir whole force in blockading the king himself. From this place theLucanian exiles sent emissaries to their countrymen, and stipulating asafe return for themselves, promised to deliver the king, either aliveor dead, into their power. But he, bravely resolving to make anextraordinary effort, at the head of a chosen band, broke through themidst of their forces; engaged singly, and slew the general of theLucanians, and collecting together his men, who had been scattered inthe retreat, arrived at a river which pointed out his road by the ruinsof a bridge which had been recently broken by the violence of the flood.Here, while the party was fording the river on a very uneven bottom, asoldier, almost spent with fatigue and apprehension, cried out as areflection on the odious name of it,--""You are justly named Acheros(dismal):"" which expression reaching the king's ears, and instantlyrecalling to his mind the fate denounced on him, he halted, hesitatingwhether he should cross over or not. Then Sotimus, one of the royal bandof youths which attended him, asking why he delayed in such a criticalmoment, showed him that the Lucanians were watching an opportunity toperpetrate some act of treachery: whereupon the king, looking back, andseeing them coming towards him in a body, drew his sword, and pushed onhis horse through the middle of the river. When he had now reached theshallow, a Lucanian exile from a distance transfixed him with a javelin:after his fall, the current carried down his lifeless body, with theweapon sticking in it, to the posts of the enemy: there a shockingmangling of it took place; for dividing it in the middle, they sent onehalf to Consentia, and kept the other, as a subject of mockery, tothemselves. While they were throwing darts and stones at it, a womanmixing with the crowd, who were enraged to a degree beyond the credibleextent of human resentment, prevailed on them to stop for a moment. Shethen told them with tears in her eyes that she had a husband andchildren, prisoners among the enemy; and that she hoped to be able withthe king's body, however disfigured, to ransom her friends: this put anend to their outrages. The remnants of his limbs were buried atConsentia, entirely through the care of the woman; and his bones weresent to Metapontum to the enemy, from whence they were conveyed toEpirus to his wife Cleopatra and his sister Olympias; the latter of whomwas the mother, the former the sister, of Alexander the Great. Such wasthe melancholy end of Alexander of Epirus; of which, although fortunedid not allow him to engage in hostilities with the Romans, yet, as hewaged war in Italy, I have thought it proper to give this brief account.This year, the fifth time since the building of the city, thelectisternium was performed at Rome for procuring the favour of the samedeities to whom it was addressed before."Book 8,Chapter 25,"When the new consuls had, by order of the people, sent persons todeclare war against the Samnites, and they themselves were making allpreparations with greater energy than against the Greeks, a newaccession of strength also came to them when expecting no such thing.The Lucanians and Apulians, nations who, until that time, had no kind ofintercourse with the Roman people, proposed an alliance with them,promising a supply of men and arms for the war: a treaty of friendshipwas accordingly concluded. At the same time, their affairs went onsuccessfully in Samnium. Three towns fell into their hands, Allif¾,Callif¾, and Ruffrium; and the adjoining country to a great extent was,on the first arrival of the consuls, laid entirely waste. Whilst the waron this side was commenced with so much success, so the war in the otherquarter where the Greeks were held besieged, now drew towards aconclusion. For, besides the communication between the two posts of theenemy being cut off, by the besiegers having possession of part of theworks through which it had been carried on, they now suffered within thewalls hardships far more grievous than those with which the enemythreatened them, and as if made prisoners by their own garrison, theywere now subjected to the greatest indignities in the persons of theirwives and children, and to such extremities as are generally felt on thesacking of cities. When, therefore, intelligence arrived thatreinforcements were to come from Tarentum and from the Samnites, allagreed that there were more of the latter already within the walls thanthey wished; but the young men of Tarentum, who were Greeks as well asthemselves, they earnestly longed for, as they hoped to be enabled bytheir means to oppose the Samnites and Nolans, no less than to resisttheir Roman enemies. At last a surrender to the Romans appeared to bethe lightest evil. Charilaus and Nymphius, the two principal men in thestate, consulting together on the subject, settled the part which eachwas to act; it, was, that one should desert to the Roman general, andthe other stay behind to manage affairs in the city, so as to facilitatethe execution of their plan. Charilaus was the person who came toPublilius Philo; he told him that ""he had taken a resolution, which hehoped would prove advantageous, fortunate, and happy to the Pal¾politansand to the Roman people, of delivering the fortifications into hishands. Whether he should appear by that deed to have betrayed orpreserved his country, depended on the honour of the Romans. That forhimself in particular, he neither stipulated nor requested any thing;but, in behalf of the state, he requested rather than stipulated, thatin case the design should succeed, the Roman people would consider moreespecially the zeal and hazard with which it sought a renewal of theirfriendship, than its folly and rashness in deviating from its duty."" Hewas commended by the general, and received a body of three thousandsoldiers, with which he was to seize on that part of the city which waspossessed by the Samnites; this detachment was commanded by LuciusQuinctius, military tribune."Book 8,Chapter 26,"At the same time also, Nymphius, on his part, artfully addressinghimself to the commander of the Samnites, prevailed upon him, as all thetroops of the Romans were employed either about Pal¾polis or in Samnium,to allow him to sail round with the fleet to the territory of Rome,where he undertook to ravage, not only the sea-coast, but the countryadjoining the very city. But, in order to avoid observation, it wasnecessary, he told him, to set out by night, and to launch the shipsimmediately. That this might be effected with the greater despatch, allthe young Samnites, except the necessary guards of the city, were sentto the shore. While Nymphius wasted the time there, giving contradictoryorders, designedly, to create confusion, which was increased by thedarkness, and by the crowd, which was so numerous as to obstruct eachother's operations, Charilaus, according to the plan concerted, wasadmitted by his associates into the city; and have filled the higherparts of it with Roman soldiers, he ordered them to raise a shout; onwhich the Greeks, who had received previous directions from theirleaders, kept themselves quiet. The Nolans fled through the oppositepart of the town, by the road leading to Nola. The flight of theSamnites, who were shut out from the city, was easier, but had a moredisgraceful appearance; for they returned to their homes without arms,stripped, and destitute of every thing; all, in short, belonging to thembeing left with their enemies; so that they were objects of ridicule,not only to foreigners, but even to their own countrymen. I know thatthere is another account of this matter, according to which the town isrepresented to have been betrayed by the Samnites; but I have thisaccount on the authority most worthy of credit; besides, the treaty ofNeapolis, for to that place the seat of government of the Greeks wasthen transferred, renders it more probable that the renewal offriendship was voluntary on their side. A triumph was decreed toPublilius, because people were well convinced that the enemy, reduced bythe siege, had adopted terms of submission. These two extraordinaryincidents, which never before occurred in any case, befell this man: aprolongation of command never before granted to any one; and a triumphafter the expiration of his office."Book 8,Chapter 27,"Another war soon after arose with the Greeks of the other coast. Forthe Tarentines having, for a considerable time, buoyed up the state ofPal¾polis with delusive hopes of assistance, when they understood thatthe Romans had gotten possession of that city, as if they were thepersons who had suffered the disappointment, and not the authors of it,they inveighed against the Pal¾politans, and became furious in theiranger and malice towards the Romans; on this account also, becauseinformation was brought that the Lucanians and Apulians had submitted tothe Roman people; for a treaty of alliance had been this year concludedwith both these nations. ""The business,"" they observed, ""was now broughtalmost to their doors; and that the matter would soon come to this, thatthe Romans must either be dealt with as enemies, or received as masters:that, in fact, their interests were involved in the war of the Samnites,and in its issue. That that was the only nation which continued to makeopposition; and that with power very inadequate, since the Lucaniansleft them: these however might yet be brought back, and induced torenounce the Roman alliance, if proper skill were used in sowingdissension between them."" These reasonings being readily adopted, bypeople who wished for a change, some young Lucanians of considerablenote among their countrymen, but devoid of honour, were procured formoney; these having lacerated each other's persons with stripes, afterthey had come naked into a public meeting of their countrymen, exclaimedthat, because they had ventured to go into the Roman camp, they had beenthus beaten with rods, by order of the consul, and had hardly escapedthe loss of their heads. A circumstance, so shocking in its nature,carrying strong proofs of the ill-treatment, none of artifice, thepeople were so irritated, that, by their clamours, they compelled themagistrates to call together the senate; and some standing round thatassembly, insisted on a declaration of war against the Romans, othersran different ways to rouse to arms the multitude residing in thecountry. Thus the tumult hurrying into imprudence the minds even ofrational men, a decree was passed, that the alliance with the Samnitesshould be renewed, and ambassadors sent for that purpose. Because thisso sudden a proceeding was totally devoid of any obvious cause for itsadoption, and consequently was little relied on for its sincerity; theywere, however, obliged both to give hostages, and also to receivegarrisons into their fortified places; and they, blinded by fraud andresentment, refused no terms. In a little time after, on the authors ofthe false charges removing to Tarentum, the whole imposition came tolight. But as they had given all power out of their own hands, nothingwas left them but unavailing repentance."Book 8,Chapter 28,"This year there arose, as it were, a new era of liberty to the Romancommons; in this that a stop was put to the practice of confiningdebtors. This alteration of the law was effected in consequence of thelust and signal cruelty of one usurer. His name was Lucius Papirius. Tohim one Caius Publilius having surrendered his person to be confined fora debt due by his father, his youth and beauty, which ought to haveexcited commiseration, operated on the other's mind as incentives tolust and insult. He first attempted to seduce the young man by impurediscourses, considering the bloom of his youth his own adventitiousgain; but finding that his ears were shocked at their infamous tendency,he then endeavoured to terrify him by threats, and reminded himfrequently of his situation. At last, convinced of his resolution to actconformably to his honourable birth, rather than to his presentcondition, he ordered him to be stripped and scourged. When with themarks of the rods imprinted in his flesh the youth rushed out into thepublic street, loudly complaining of the depravedness and inhumanity ofthe usurer; a vast number of people, moved by compassion for his earlyage, and indignation at his barbarous treatment, reflecting at the sametime on their own lot and that of their children, flocked together intothe forum, and from thence in a body to the senate-house. When theconsuls were obliged by the sudden tumult to call a meeting of thesenate, the people, falling at the feet of each of the senators, as theywere going into the senate-house, presented to their view the laceratedback of the youth. On that day, in consequence of the outrageous conductof an individual, the strongest bonds of credit were broken; and theconsuls were commanded to propose to the people, that no person shouldbe held in fetters or stocks, except convicted of a crime, and in orderto punishment; but that, for money due, the goods of the debtor, not hisperson, should be answerable. Thus the confined debtors were released;and provision made, for the time to come, that they should not be liableto confinement."Book 8,Chapter 29,"In the course of this year, while the war with the Samnites wassufficient in itself to give full employment to the senate, besides thesudden defection of the Lucanians, and the Tarentines, the promoters ofthe defection, [another source of uneasiness] was added in a unionformed by the state of the Vestinians with the Samnites. Which event,though it continued, during the present year, to be the general subjectof conversation, without coming under any public discussion, appeared soimportant to the consuls of the year following, Lucius Furius Camillus asecond time, and Junius Brutus Sc¾va, that it was the first businesswhich they proposed to the consideration of the state. And though thematter was still recent, still great perplexity seized the senate, asthey dreaded equally the consequences, either of passing it over, or oftaking it up; lest, on the one hand, impunity might stir up theneighbouring states with wantonness and arrogance; and, on the other,punishment inflicted on them by force of arms, and dread of immediatedanger, might produce the same effect by exciting resentment. And thewhole body, too, was in every way equal in strength to the Samnites,being composed of the Marsians, the Pelignians, and the Marrusinians;all of whom would have to be encountered as enemies, if the Vestinianswere to be interfered with. However, that side prevailed which might, atthe time, seem to have more spirit than prudence; but the event provedthat fortune assists the brave. The people, in pursuance of thedirection of the senate, ordered war against the Vestinians; thatprovince fell by lot to Junius, Samnium to Camillus. Armies were led toboth places, and by carefully guarding the frontiers, the enemy wereprevented from joining their forces. But the other consul, LuciusFurius, on whom the principal weight of the business rested, waswithdrawn by chance from the war, being seized with a severe sickness.Being therefore ordered to nominate a dictator to conduct the business,he nominated Lucius Papirius Cursor, the most celebrated general, byfar, of any in that age, who appointed Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianusmaster of the horse: a pair of commanders distinguished for theirexploits in war; more so, however, for a quarrel between themselves, andwhich proceeded almost to violence. The other consul, in the territoryof the Vestinians, carried on operations of various kinds; and, in all,was uniformly successful. For he both utterly laid waste their lands,and, by spoiling and burning their houses and corn, compelled them tocome to an engagement; and, in one battle, he reduced the strength ofthe Vestinians to such a degree, though not without loss on his ownside, that the enemy not only fled to their camp, but, fearing even totrust to the rampart and trench, dispersed from thence into the severaltowns, in hopes of finding security in the situation and fortificationsof their cities. At last, having undertaken to reduce their towns byforce, amid the great ardour of the soldiers, and their resentment forthe wounds which they had received, (hardly one of them having come outof the battle unhurt,) he took Cutina by scalade, and afterwardsCingilia. The spoil of both cities he gave to the soldiers, inconsideration of their having bravely surmounted the obstruction both ofgates and walls."Book 8,Chapter 30,"The commanders entered Samnium under uncertain auspices; aninformality which pointed, not at the event of war, for that wasprosperous, but at the furious passions and the quarrels which broke outbetween the leaders. For Papirius the dictator, returning to Rome inorder to take the auspices anew, in consequence of a caution receivedfrom the aruspex, left strict orders with the master of the horse toremain in his post, and not to engage in battle during his absence.After the departure of the dictator, Fabius having discovered by hisscouts that the enemy were in as unguarded a state as if there was not asingle Roman in Samnium, the high-spirited youth, (either conceivingindignation at the sole authority in every point appearing to be lodgedin the hands of the dictator, or induced by the opportunity of strikingan important blow,) having made the necessary preparations anddispositions, marched to a place called Imbrinium, and there fought abattle with the Samnites. His success in the fight was such, that therewas no one circumstance which could have been improved to moreadvantage, if the dictator had been present. The leader was not wantingto the soldiers, nor the soldiers to their leader. The cavalry too,(finding, after repeated charges, that they could not break the ranks,)by the advice of Lucius Cominius, a military tribune, pulled off thebridles from their horses and spurred them on so furiously, that nopower could withstand them; forcing their way through the thickest ofthe enemy, they bore down every thing before them; and the infantryseconding the charge, the whole body was thrown into confusion. Twentythousand of the enemy are said to have fallen on that day. I haveauthority for saying that there were two battles fought during thedictator's absence, and two victories obtained; but, according to themost ancient writers, only this one is found, and in some histories thewhole transaction is omitted. The master of the horse getting possessionof abundance of spoils, in consequence of the great numbers slain,collected the arms into a huge heap, and burned them; either inpursuance of a vow to some of the gods, or, if we choose to credit theauthority of Fabius, it was done on this account, that the dictatormight not reap the fruits of his glory, inscribe his name on them, orcarry the spoils in triumph. His letters also, containing an account ofthe success, being sent to the senate, not to the dictator, showedplainly that he wished not to impart to him any share of the honour; whocertainly viewed the proceeding in this light, for while others rejoicedat the victory obtained, he showed only surliness and anger; insomuchthat, immediately dismissing the senate, he hastened out of thesenate-house, and frequently repeated with warmth, that the legions ofthe Samnites were not more effectually vanquished and overthrown by themaster of the horse, than were the dictatorial dignity and militarydiscipline, if such contempt of orders escaped with impunity. Thus,breathing resentment and menaces, he set out for the camp; but, thoughhe travelled with all possible expedition, he was unable, however, tooutstrip the report of his coming. For messengers had started from thecity before him, who brought intelligence that the dictator was coming,eager for vengeance, and in almost every second sentence applauding theconduct of Titus Manlius."Book 8,Chapter 31,"Fabius instantly called an assembly, and entreated the soldiers to""show the same courage in protecting him, under whose conduct andauspices they had conquered, from the outrageous cruelty of thedictator, which they had so lately displayed in defending thecommonwealth from its most inveterate enemies. He was now coming,"" hetold them, ""frantic with envy; enraged at another's bravery and success,he was mad, because, in his absence, the business of the public had beenexecuted, with remarkable success; and if he could change the fortune ofthe engagement, would wish the Samnites in possession of victory ratherthan the Romans. He talked much of contempt of orders; as if hisprohibition of fighting were not dictated by the same motive, whichcaused his vexation at the fight having taken place. He wished toshackle the valour of others through envy, and meant to take away thesoldiers' arms when they were most eager for action, and that no usemight be made of them in his absence: he was further enraged too,because without Lucius Papirius the soldiers were not without hands orarms, and because Quintus Fabius considered himself as master of thehorse, not as a beadle to the dictator. How would he have behaved, hadthe issue of the fight been unfortunate; which, through the chances ofwar and the uncertainty of military operations, might have been thecase; since now, when the enemy has been vanquished, (as completely,indeed, as if that leader's own singular talents had been employed inthe matter,) he yet threatens the master of the horse with punishment?Nor is he more incensed against the master of the horse, than againstthe military tribunes, the centurions, and the soldiers. On all, hewould vent his rage if he could; and because that is not in his power,he vents it on one. Envy, like flame, soars upwards; aims at the summit;that he makes his attack on the head of the business, on the leader. Ifhe could put him out of the way, together with the glory of the serviceperformed, he would then lord it, like a conqueror over vanquishedtroops; and, without scruple, practise against the soldiers what he hadbeen allowed to act against their commander. That they should,therefore, in his cause, support the general liberty of all. If thedictator perceived among the troops the same unanimity in justifyingtheir victory that they had displayed in the battle, and that allinterested themselves in the safety of one, it would bend his temper tomilder counsels. In fine,"" he told them, ""that he committed his life,and all his interests, to their honour and to their courage."""Book 8,Chapter 32,"His speech was received with the loudest acclamations from everypart of the assembly, bidding him ""have courage; for while the Romanlegions were in being, no man should offer him violence."" Not longafter, the dictator arrived, and instantly summoned an assembly by soundof trumpet. Then silence being made, a crier cited Quintus Fabius,master of the horse, and as soon as, on the lower ground, he hadapproached the tribunal, the dictator said, ""Quintus Fabius, I demand ofyou, when the authority of dictator is acknowledged to be supreme, andis submitted to by the consuls, officers endowed with regal power; andlikewise by the pr¾tors, created under the same auspices with consuls;whether or no you think it reasonable that it should not meet obediencefrom a master of the horse? I also ask you whether, when I knew that Iset out from home under uncertain auspices, the safety of thecommonwealth ought to have been endangered by me, whilst the omens wereconfused, or whether the auspices ought to be newly taken, so thatnothing might be done while the will of the gods remained doubtful? Andfurther, when a religious scruple was of such a nature as to hinder thedictator from acting, whether the master of the horse could be exemptfrom it and at liberty? But why do I ask these questions, when, though Ihad gone without leaving any orders, your own judgment ought to havebeen regulated according to what you could discover of my intention? Whydo you not answer? Did I not forbid you to act, in any respect, duringmy absence? Did I not forbid you to engage the enemy? Yet, in contemptof these my orders, while the auspices were uncertain, while the omenswere confused, contrary to the practice of war, contrary to thediscipline of our ancestors, and contrary to the authority of the gods,you dared to enter on the fight. Answer to these questions proposed toyou. On any other matter utter not a word. Lictor, draw near him."" Toeach of these particulars, Fabius, finding it no easy matter to answer,at one time remonstrated against the same person acting as accuser andjudge, in a cause which affected his very existence; at another, heasserted that his life should sooner be forced from him, than the gloryof his past services; clearing himself and accusing the other by turns;so then Papirius' anger blazing out with fresh fury, he ordered themaster of the horse to be stripped, and the rods and axes to be gotready. Fabius, imploring the protection of the soldiers, while thelictors were tearing his garments, betook himself to the quarters of theveterans, who were already raising a commotion in the assembly: fromthem the uproar spread through the whole body; in one place the voice ofsupplication was heard; in another, menaces. Those who happened to standnearest to the tribunal, because, being under the eyes of the general,they could easily be known, entreated him to spare the master of thehorse, and not in him to condemn the whole army. The remoter parts ofthe assembly, and the crowd collected round Fabius, railed at theunrelenting spirit of the dictator, and were not far from mutiny; norwas even the tribunal perfectly quiet. The lieutenants-general standinground the general's seat besought him to adjourn the business to thenext day, and to allow time to his anger, and room for consideration;representing that ""the indiscretion of Fabius had been sufficientlyrebuked; his victory sufficiently disgraced; and they begged him not toproceed to the extreme of severity; not to brand with ignominy a youthof extraordinary merit, or his father, a man of most illustriouscharacter, together with the whole family of the Fabii."" When they madebut little impression either by their prayers or arguments, they desiredhim to observe the violent ferment of the assembly, and told him that""while the soldiers' tempers were heated to such a degree, it became noteither his age or his wisdom to kindle them into a flame, and affordmatter for a mutiny; that no one would lay the blame of such an event onQuintus Fabius, who only deprecated punishment; but on the dictator, if,blinded by resentment, he should, by an ill-judged contest, draw onhimself the fury of the multitude: and lest he should think that theyacted from motives of regard to Quintus Fabius, they were ready to makeoath that, in their judgment, it was not for the interest of thecommonwealth that Quintus Fabius should be punished at that time."""Book 8,Chapter 33,"When by these expostulations they rather irritated the dictatoragainst themselves, than appeased his anger against the master of thehorse, the lieutenants-general were ordered to go down from thetribunal; and after several vain attempts were made to procure silenceby means of a crier, the noise and tumult being so great that neitherthe voice of the dictator himself, nor that of his apparitors, could beheard; night, as in the case of a battle, put an end to the contest. Themaster of the horse was ordered to attend on the day following; but whenall assured him that Papirius, being agitated and exasperated in thecourse of the present contention, would proceed against him with greaterviolence, he fled privately from the camp to Rome; where, by the adviceof his father, Marcus Fabius, who had been three times consul, andlikewise dictator, he immediately called a meeting of the senate. Whilehe was strenuously complaining before the fathers of the rage andinjustice of the dictator, on a sudden was heard the noise of lictorsbefore the senate-house, clearing the way, and Papirius himself arrived,full of resentment, having followed, with a guard of light horse, assoon as he heard that the other had quitted the camp. The contentionthen began anew, and the dictator ordered Fabius to be seized. Where,when his unrelenting spirit persisted in its purpose, notwithstandingthe united intercessions of the principal patricians, and of the wholesenate, Fabius, the father, then said, ""Since neither the authority ofthe senate has any weight with you; nor my age, which you wish to renderchildless; nor the noble birth and merit of a master of the horse,nominated by yourself; nor prayers which have often mitigated the rageof an enemy, and which appease the wrath of the gods; I call upon thetribunes of the commons for support, and appeal to the people; and sinceyou decline the judgment of your own army, as well as of the senate, Icall you before a judge who must certainly be allowed, though no othershould, to possess more power and authority than yourself, thoughdictator. I shall see whether you will submit to an appeal, to whichTullus Hostilius, a Roman king, submitted."" They proceeded directly fromthe senate-house to the assembly; where, being arrived, the dictatorattended by few, the master of the horse by all the people of the firstrank in a body, Papirius commanded him to be taken from the rostrum tothe lower ground; his father, following him, said, ""You do well inordering us to be brought down to a place where even as private personswe have liberty of speech."" At first, instead of regular speeches,nothing but altercation was heard; at length, the indignation of oldFabius, and the strength of his voice, got the better of noise, while hereproached Papirius with arrogance and cruelty. ""He himself,"" he said,""had been dictator at Rome; and no man, not even the lowest plebeian, orcenturion, or soldier, had been outraged by him. But Papirius sought forvictory and triumph over a Roman commander, as over the generals of theenemy. What an immense difference between the moderation of theancients, and modern oppression and cruelty. Quinctius Cincinnatus whendictator exercised no further severity on Lucius Minucius the consul,although rescued by him from a siege, than leaving him at the head ofthe army, in the quality of lieutenant-general, instead of consul.Marcus Furius Camillus, in the case of Lucius Furius, who, in contemptof his great age and authority, had fought a battle with a mostdisgraceful result, not only restrained his anger at the time so as towrite no unfavourable representation of his conduct to the people or thesenate; but after returning home, when the patricians gave him a powerof electing from among his colleagues whoever he might approve as anassociate with himself in the command, chose that very man inpreference to all the other consular tribunes. Nay, that not even theresentment of the people, with whom lay the supreme power in all cases,was ever exercised with greater severity towards those who, throughrashness and ignorance, had occasioned the loss of armies, than thefining them in a sum of money. Until that day, a capital prosecution forill conduct in war had never been instituted against any commander, butnow generals of the Roman people when victorious, and meriting the mosthonourable triumphs, are threatened with rods and axes; a treatmentwhich would not have been deemed allowable, even towards those who hadbeen defeated by an enemy. What would his son have to suffer, if he hadoccasioned the loss of the army? if he had been routed, put to flight,and driven out of his camp? To what greater length could his resentmentand violence be stretched, than to scourge him, and put him to death?How was it consistent with reason, that through the means of QuintusFabius, the state should be filled with joy, exulting in victory, andoccupied in thanksgivings and congratulations; while at the same time,he who had given occasion to the temples of the gods being thrown open,their altars yet smoking with sacrifices, and loaded with honours andofferings, should be stripped naked, and torn with stripes in the sightof the Roman people; within view of the Capitol and citadel, and ofthose gods not in vain invoked in two different battles? With whattemper would the army which had conquered under his conduct and auspiceshave borne it? What mourning would there be in the Roman camp! what joyamong their enemies!"" This speech he accompanied with an abundant flowof tears; uniting reproaches and complaints, imploring the aid both ofgods and men, and warmly embracing his son."Book 8,Chapter 34,"On his side stood the majesty of the senate, the favour of thepeople, the support of the tribunes, and regard for the absent army. Onthe other side were urged the inviolable authority of the Romangovernment and military discipline; the edict of the dictator, alwaysobserved as the mandate of a deity; the orders of Manlius, and hispostponing even parental affection to public utility. ""The same also,""said the dictator, ""was the conduct of Lucius Brutus, the founder ofRoman liberty, in the case of his two sons. That now fathers werebecome indulgent, and the aged indifferent in the case of the authorityof others being despised, and indulge the young in the subversion ofmilitary order, as if it were a matter of trifling consequence. For hispart, however, he would persevere in his purpose, and would not remitthe smallest part of the punishment justly due to a person who foughtcontrary to his orders, while the rites of religion were imperfectlyexecuted, and the auspices uncertain. Whether the majesty of the supremeauthority was to be perpetual or not, depended not on him; but LuciusPapirius would not diminish aught of its rights. He wished that thetribunitian office, inviolate itself, would not by its interpositionviolate the authority of the Roman government; nor the Roman people, totheir own detriment particularly, annihilate the dictator and the rightsof the dictatorship together. But if this should be the case, not LuciusPapirius but the tribunes and the people would be blamed by posterity invain; when military discipline being once dissolved, the soldier wouldno longer obey the orders of the centurion, the centurion those of thetribune, the tribune those of the lieutenant-general, thelieutenant-general those of the consul, nor the master of the horsethose of the dictator. No one would then pay any deference to men, no,nor even to the gods. Neither edicts of generals nor auspices would beobserved. The soldiers, without leave of absence, would straggle atrandom through the lands of friends and of foes; and regardless of theiroath would, influenced solely by a wanton humour, quit the servicewhenever they might choose. The standards would be unattended andforsaken: the men would neither assemble in pursuance of orders, norwould any distinction be made as to fighting by night or by day, onfavourable or unfavourable ground, by order or without the the orders ofthe general; nor would they observe standards or ranks; the service,instead of being solemn and sacred, would be confused and the result ofmere chance, like that of freebooters. Render yourselves then, tribunesof the commons, accountable for all these evils to all future ages.Expose your own persons to these heavy imputations in defence of thelicentious conduct of Quintus Fabius."""Book 8,Chapter 35,"The tribunes now confounded, and more anxiously concerned at theirown situation than at his for whom their support was sought, were freedfrom this embarrassment by the Roman people unanimously having recourseto prayers and entreaties, that the dictator would, for their sakes,remit the punishment of the master of the horse. The tribunes likewise,following the example set them of employing entreaties, earnestlybeseech the dictator to pardon human error, to consider the immaturityof the offender's age; that he had suffered sufficiently; and now theyouth himself, now his father, Marcus Fabius, disclaiming furthercontest, fell at the dictator's knees and deprecated his wrath. Then thedictator, after causing silence, said, ""Romans, it is well. Militarydiscipline has prevailed; the majesty of government has prevailed; bothwhich were in danger of ceasing this day to exist. Quintus Fabius, whofought contrary to the order of his commander, is not acquitted ofguilt; but after being condemned as guilty, is granted as a boon to theRoman people; is granted to the college of tribunes, supporting him withtheir prayers, not with the regular power of their office. Live, QuintusFabius, more happy in this united sympathy of the state for yourpreservation, than in the victory in which you lately exulted. Live,after having ventured on such an act, as your father himself, had hebeen in the place of Lucius Papirius, would not have pardoned. With meyou shall be reconciled whenever you wish it. To the Roman people, towhom you owe your life, you can perform no greater service than to letthis day teach you a sufficient lesson to enable you to submit to lawfulcommands, both in war and peace."" He then declared, that he no longerdetained the master of the horse, and as he retired from the rostrum,the senate being greatly rejoiced, and the people still more so,gathered round him and escorted him, on one hand commending thedictator, on the other congratulating the master of the horse; while itwas considered that the authority of military command was confirmed noless effectually by the danger of Quintus Fabius that the lamentablepunishment of young Manlius. It so happened, that, through the course ofthat year, as often as the dictator left the army the Samnites were inmotion: but Marcus Valerius, the lieutenant-general who commanded in thecamp, had Quintus Fabius before his eyes for an example, not to fear anyviolence of the enemy, so much as the unrelenting anger of the dictator.So that when a body of his foragers fell into an ambuscade and were cutto pieces in disadvantageous ground, it was generally believed that thelieutenant-general could have given them assistance if he had not beenheld in dread by his rigorous orders. The resentment for this alsoalienated the affections of the soldiery from the dictator, alreadyincensed against him because he had been implacable towards QuintusFabius, and because he had granted him pardon at the intercession of theRoman people, a thing which he had refused to their entreaties."Book 8,Chapter 36,"The dictator, having appointed Lucius Papirius Crassus, as master ofthe horse, to the command of the city, and prohibited Quintus Fabiusfrom acting in any case as magistrate, returned to the camp; where hisarrival brought neither any great joy to his countrymen, nor any degreeof terror to the enemy: for on the day following, either not knowingthat the dictator had arrived, or little regarding whether he werepresent or absent, they approached his camp in order of battle. Of suchimportance, however, was that single man, Lucius Papirius, that had thezeal of the soldiers seconded the dispositions of the commander, nodoubt was entertained that an end might have been put that day to thewar with the Samnites; so judiciously did he draw up his army withrespect to situation and reserves, in such a manner did he strengthenthem with every advantage of military skill: but the soldiers exerted novigour; and designedly kept from conquering, in order to injure thereputation of their leader. Of the Samnites, however, very many wereslain; and great numbers of the Romans wounded. The experiencedcommander quickly perceived the circumstance which prevented hissuccess, and that it would be necessary to moderate his temper, and tomingle mildness with austerity. Accordingly, attended by thelieutenants-general, going round to the wounded soldiers, thrusting hishead into their tents, and asking them, one by one, how they were inhealth; then, mentioning them by name, he gave them in charge to theofficers, tribunes, and pr¾fects. This behaviour, popular in itself, hemaintained with such dexterity, that by his attention to their recoveryhe gradually gained their affection; nor did any thing so muchcontribute towards their recovery as the circumstance of this attentionbeing received with gratitude. The army being restored to health, hecame to an engagement with the enemy; and both himself and the troops,being possessed with full confidence of success, he so entirely defeatedand dispersed the Samnites, that that was the last day they met thedictator in the field. The victorious army, afterwards, directed itsmarch wherever a prospect of booty invited, and traversed the enemies'territories, encountering not a weapon, nor any opposition, eitheropenly or by stratagem. It added to their alacrity, that the dictatorhad, by proclamation, given the whole spoil to the soldiers; so thatthey were animated not only by the public quarrel, but by their privateemolument. Reduced by these losses, the Samnites sued to the dictatorfor peace, and, after they had engaged to supply each of his soldierswith a suit of clothes and a year's pay, being ordered to apply to thesenate, they answered, that they would follow the dictator, committingtheir cause wholly to his integrity and honour. On this the troops werewithdrawn out of Samnium."Book 8,Chapter 37,"The dictator entered the city in triumph; and, though desirous ofresigning his office immediately, yet, by order of the senate, he heldit until the consuls were elected: these were Caius Sulpicius Longus asecond time, and Quintus ®milius Cerretanus. The Samnites, withoutfinishing the treaty of peace, the terms being still in negotiation,brought home with them a truce for a year. Nor was even that faithfullyobserved; so strongly was their inclination for war excited, on hearingthat Papirius was gone out of office. In this consulate of CaiusSulpicius and Quintus ®milius, (some histories have Aulius,) to therevolt of the Samnites was added a new war with the Apulians. Armieswere sent against both. The Samnites fell by lot to Sulpicius, theApulians to ®milius. Some writers say, that this war was not waged withthe Apulians, but that the allied states of that nation were defendedagainst the violence and injustice of the Samnites. But thecircumstances of the Samnites, who could with difficulty, at thatperiod, support a war in which themselves were engaged, render it moreprobable that they did not make war on the Apulians, but that bothnations were in arms against the Romans at the same time. However, nomemorable event occurred. The lands of the Apulians and of Samnium wereutterly laid waste; but in neither quarter were the enemy to be found.At Rome, an alarm, which happened in the night, suddenly roused thepeople from their sleep, in such a fright, that the Capitol and citadel,the walls and gates, were all filled with men in arms. But after theyhad called all to their posts, and run together in bodies, in everyquarter, when day approached, neither the author nor cause of the alarmcould be discovered. This year, in pursuance to the advice of Flavius,the Tusculans were brought to a trial before the people. Marcus Flavius,a tribune of the commons, proposed, that punishment should be inflictedon those of the Tusculans, ""by whose advice and assistance theVeliternians and Privernians had made war on the Roman people."" TheTusculans, with their wives and children, came to Rome. The whole partyin mourning habits, like persons under accusation, went round thetribes, throwing themselves at the feet of the citizens. The compassionthus excited operated more effectually towards procuring them pardon,than all their arguments did towards clearing them of guilt. Every oneof the tribes, except the Pollian, negatived the proposition. Thesentence of the Pollian tribe was, that the grown-up males should bebeaten and put to death, and their wives and children sold by auction,according to the rules of war. It appears that the resentment which roseagainst the advisers of so rigorous a measure, was retained in memory bythe Tusculans down to the age of our fathers; and that hardly anycandidate of the Pollian tribe could, ever since, gain the votes of thePapirian."Book 8,Chapter 38," On the following year, in the consulate of Quintus Fabius and LuciusFulvius, Aulus Cornelius Arvina being made dictator, and Marcus FabiusAmbustus master of the horse, a levy being held with more than usualrigour in consequence of their apprehension of a very serious war inSamnium, (for it was reported that some young men had been hired fromtheir neighbours,) led forth a very strong army against the Samnites.Although in a hostile country, their camp was pitched in as careless amanner as if the foe were at a great distance; when, suddenly, thelegions of the Samnites approached with so much boldness as to advancetheir rampart close to an out-post of the Romans. Night was now comingon; that prevented their assaulting the works; but they did not concealtheir intention of doing so next day, as soon as the light shouldappear. The dictator found that there would be a necessity for fightingsooner than he had expected, and lest the situation should be anobstruction to the bravery of the troops, he led away the legions insilence, leaving a great number of fires the better to deceive theenemy. On account of the proximity of the camps, however, he could notescape their observation: their cavalry instantly pursued, and pressedclosely on his troops, in such a way as to refrain from attacking themuntil the day appeared. Their infantry did not even quit their campbefore daylight. As soon as it was dawn, the cavalry venturing to attackthe enemy by harassing the Roman rear, and pressing them in places ofdifficult passage, considerably delayed their march. Meanwhile theirinfantry overtook the cavalry; and now the Samnites pursued close withtheir entire force. The dictator then, finding that he could no longergo forward without great inconvenience, ordered the spot where he stoodto be measured out for a camp. But it was impossible, while the enemy'shorse were spread about on every side, that palisades could be brought,and the work be begun: seeing it, therefore, impracticable, either tomarch forward or to settle himself there, he drew up his troops forbattle, removing the baggage out of the line. The enemy likewise formedtheir line opposite to his; fully equal both in spirit and in strength.Their courage was chiefly improved from not knowing that the motive ofthe Romans' retreat was the incommodiousness of the ground, so that theyimagined themselves objects of terror, and supposed that they werepursuing men who fled through fear. This kept the balance of the fightequal for a considerable time; though, of late, it had been unusual withthe Samnites to stand even the shout of a Roman army. Certain it is,that the contest, on this day, continued so very doubtful from the thirdhour to the eighth, that neither was the shout repeated, after beingraised at the first onset, nor the standards moved either forward orbackward; nor any ground lost on either side. They fought without takingbreath or looking behind them, every man in his post, and pushingagainst their opponents with their shields. The noise continuing equal,and the terror of the fight the same, seemed to denote, that thedecision would be effected either by fatigue or by the night. The menhad now exhausted their strength, the sword its power, and the leaderstheir skill; when, on a sudden, the Samnite cavalry, having learned froma single troop which had advanced beyond the rest, that the baggage ofthe Romans lay at a distance from their army, without any guard ordefence; through eagerness for booty, they attack it: of which thedictator being informed by a hasty messenger, said, ""Let them onlyencumber themselves with spoils."" Afterwards came several, one afteranother, crying out, that they were plundering and carrying off all theeffects of the soldiers: he then called to him the master of the horse,and said, ""Do you see, Marcus Fabius, that the fight has been forsakenby the enemy's cavalry? They are entangled and encumbered with ourbaggage. Attack them whilst scattered about, as is the case of everymultitude employed in plundering; you will find few mounted onhorseback, few with swords in their hands; and, while they are loadingtheir horses with spoil, and unarmed, put them to the sword, and make itbloody spoil for them. I will take care of the legions, and the fight ofthe infantry: yours be the honour which the horse shall acquire."""Book 8,Chapter 39,"The body of cavalry, in the most exact order possible, charging theenemy, who were straggling and embarrassed, filled every place withslaughter: for amid the packages which they hastily threw down, andwhich lay in the way of their feet, and of the affrighted horses, asthey endeavoured to escape, being now unable either to fight or fly,they are slaughtered. Then Fabius, after he had almost entirely cut offthe enemy's horse, led round his squadrons in a small circuit, andattacked the infantry in the rear. The new shout, raised in thatquarter, terrified the Samnites on the one hand; and when, on the other,the dictator saw their troops in the van looking behind them, theirbattalions in confusion, and their line wavering, he earnestly exhortedand animated his men, calling on the tribunes and chief centurions, byname, to join him in renewing the fight. Raising the shout anew, theypressed forward, and as they advanced, perceived the enemy more and moreconfused. The cavalry now could be seen by those in front, andCornelius, turning about to the several companies, made them understand,by raising his voice and hands, that he saw the standards and bucklersof his own horsemen. On hearing which, and at the same time seeing them,they, at once, so far forgot the fatigue which they had endured throughalmost the whole day, and even their wounds, that they rushed on againstthe enemy with as much vigour and alacrity as if they were coming freshout of camp on receiving the signal for battle. The Samnites could nolonger sustain the charge of horse and foot together; part of them,enclosed on both sides, were cut off; the rest were scattered and fleddifferent ways. The infantry slew those who were surrounded and maderesistance; and the cavalry made great havoc of the fugitives, amongwhom fell their general. This battle crushed, at length, the power ofthe Samnites so effectually, that, in all their meetings, they said, ""itwas not at all to be wondered at, if in an impious war, commenced inviolation of a treaty, when the gods were, with justice, more incensedagainst them than men, they succeeded in none of their undertakings.That war must be expiated and atoned for with a heavy penalty. The onlyalternative they had, was whether the penalty should be the guilty bloodof a few, or the innocent blood of all."" Some now ventured to name theauthors of the war; one name in particular, by the united voices of all,was mentioned, that of Brutulus Papius; he was a man of power and noblebirth, and undoubtedly the violator of the late truce. The pr¾tors beingcompelled to take the opinion of the assembly concerning him, a decreewas made, ""that Brutulus Papius should be delivered into the hands ofthe Romans; and that, together with him, all the spoil taken from theRomans, and the prisoners, should be sent to Rome, and that therestitution demanded by the heralds, in conformity to treaty, should bemade, as was agreeable to justice and equity."" In pursuance of thisdetermination heralds were sent to Rome, and also the dead body ofBrutulus; for, by a voluntary death, he avoided the punishment andignominy intended for him. It was thought proper that his goods alsoshould be delivered up along with the body. But none of all those thingswere accepted, except the prisoners, and such articles of the spoil aswere recognised by the owners. The dictator obtained a triumph by adecree of the senate."Book 8,Chapter 40,"Some writers affirm, that this war was conducted by the consuls, andthat they triumphed over the Samnites; and also, that Fabius advancedinto Apulia, and carried off from thence abundance of spoil. But thatAulus Cornelius was dictator that year is an undisputed fact. Thequestion then is, whether he was appointed for the purpose of conductingthe war, or on occasion of the illness of Lucius Plautius, the pr¾tor;in order that there might be a magistrate to give the signal for thestarting of the chariots at the Roman games. This latter is asserted ofhim; and that after performing the business, which in truth reflected nogreat lustre on his office, he resigned the dictatorship. It is noteasy to determine between either the facts or the writers, which of themdeserves the preference: I am inclined to think that history has beenmuch corrupted by means of funeral panegyrics and false inscriptions onstatues; each family striving by false representations to appropriate toitself the fame of warlike exploits and public honours. From this cause,certainly, both the actions of individuals and the public records ofevents have been confused. Nor is there extant any writer, contemporarywith those events, on whose authority we can with certainty rely."Book 9,Chapter 1,"This year is followed by the convention of Caudium, so memorable onaccount of the misfortune of the Romans, the consuls being TitusVeturius Calvinus and Spurius Postumius. The Samnites had as theircommander that year Caius Ponius, son to Herennius, born of a fathermost highly renowned for wisdom, and himself a consummate warrior andcommander. When the ambassadors, who had been sent to makerestitution, returned, without concluding a peace, he said, ""That yemay not think that no purpose has been effected by this embassy,whatever degree of anger the deities of heaven had conceived againstus, on account of the infraction of the treaty, has been herebyexpiated. I am very confident, that whatever deities they were, whosewill it was that you should be reduced to the necessity of making therestitution, which had been demanded according to the treaty, it wasnot agreeable to them, that our atonement for the breach of treasonshould be so haughtily spurned by the Romans. For what more couldpossibly be done towards appeasing the gods, and softening the angerof men, than we have done? The effects of the enemy, taken among thespoils, which appeared to be our own by the right of war, we restored:the authors of the war, as we could not deliver them up alive, wedelivered them dead: their goods we carried to Rome, lest by retainingthem, any degree of guilt should remain among us. What more, Roman, doI owe to thee? what to the treaty? what to the gods, the guarantees ofthe treaty? What arbitrator shall I call in to judge of yourresentment, and of my punishment? I decline none; neither nation norprivate person. But if nothing in human law is left to the weakagainst stronger, I will appeal to the gods, the avengers ofintolerant arrogance, and will beseech them to turn their wrathagainst those for whom neither the restoration of their own effectsnor additional heaps of other men's property, can suffice, whosecruelty is not satiated by the death of the guilty, by the surrenderof their lifeless bodies, nor by their goods accompanying thesurrender of the owner; who cannot be appeased otherwise than bygiving them our blood to drink, and our entrails to be torn. Samnites,war is just to those for whom it is necessary, and arms are clear ofimpiety for those who have no hope left but in arms. Wherefore, as inevery human undertaking, it is of the utmost importance what mattermen may set about with the favour, what under the displeasure of thegods, be assured that the former wars ye waged in opposition to thegods more than to men; in this, which is now impending, ye will actunder the immediate guidance of the gods themselves."""Book 9,Chapter 2,"After uttering these predictions, not more cheering than true, heled out the troops, and placed his camp about Caudium as much out ofview as possible. From thence he sent to Calatia, where he heard thatthe Roman consuls were encamped, ten soldiers, in the habit ofshepherds, and ordered them to keep some cattle feeding in severaldifferent places, at a small distance from the Roman posts; and that,when they fell in with any of their foragers, they should all agree inthe same story, that the legions of the Samnites were then in Apulia,that they were besieging Luceria with their whole force, and very neartaking it by storm. Such a rumour had been industriously spreadbefore, and had already reached the Romans; but these prisonersincreased the credit of it, especially as they all concurred in thesame report. There was no doubt but that the Romans would carrysuccour to the Lucerians, as being good and faithful allies; and forthis further reason, lest all Apulia, through apprehension of theimpending danger, might go over to the enemy. The only point ofdeliberation was, by what road they should go. There were two roadsleading to Luceria, one along the coast of the upper sea, wide andopen; but, as it was the safer, so it was proportionably longer: theother, which was shorter, through the Caudine forks. The nature of theplace is this: there are two deep glens, narrow and covered with wood,connected together by mountains ranging on both sides from one to theother; between these lies a plain of considerable extent, enclosed inthe middle, abounding in grass and water, and through the middle ofwhich the passage runs: but before you can arrive at it, the firstdefile must be passed, while the only way back is through the road bywhich you entered it; or if in case of resolving to proceed forward,you must go by the other glen, which is still more narrow anddifficult. Into this plain the Romans, having marched down theirtroops by one of those passes through the cleft of a rock, when theyadvanced onward to the other defile, found it blocked up by treesthrown across, and a mound of huge stones lying in their way. When thestratagem of the enemy now became apparent, there is seen at the sametime a body of troops on the eminence over the glen. Hastening back,then, they proceed to retrace the road by which they had entered; theyfound that also shut up by such another fence, and men in arms. Then,without orders, they halted; amazement took possession of their minds,and a strange kind of numbness seized their limbs: they then remaineda long time motionless and silent, each looking to the other, as ifeach thought the other more capable of judging and advising thanhimself. After some time, when they saw that the consul's pavilionswere being erected, and that some were getting ready the implementsfor throwing up works, although they were sensible that it must appearridiculous the attempt to raise a fortification in their presentdesperate condition, and when almost every hope was lost, would be anobject of necessity, yet, not to add a fault to their misfortunes,they all, without being advised or ordered by any one, set earnestlyto work, and enclosed a camp with a rampart, close to the water, whilethemselves, besides that the enemy heaped insolent taunts on them,seemed with melancholy to acknowledge the apparent fruitlessness oftheir toil and labour. The lieutenants-general and tribunes, withoutbeing summoned to consultation, (for there was no room for eitherconsultation or remedy,) assembled round the dejected consul; whilethe soldiers, crowding to the general's quarters, demanded from theirleaders that succour, which it was hardly in the power of the immortalgods themselves to afford them."Book 9,Chapter 3,"Night came on them while lamenting their situation rather thanconsulting, whilst they urged expedients, each according to histemper; one crying out, ""Let us go over those fences of the roads;""others, ""over the steeps; through the woods; any way, where arms canbe carried. Let us be but permitted to come to the enemy, whom we havebeen used to conquer now near thirty years. All places will be leveland plain to a Roman, fighting against the perfidious Samnite.""Another would say, ""Whither, or by what way can we go? Do we expect toremove the mountains from their foundations? While these cliffs hangover us, by what road will you reach the enemy? Whether armed orunarmed, brave or dastardly, we are all, without distinction, capturedand vanquished. The enemy will not even show us a weapon by which wemight die with honour. He will finish the war without moving from hisseat."" In such discourse, thinking of neither food nor rest, the nightwas passed. Nor could the Samnites, though in circumstances so joyous,instantly determine how to act: it was therefore universally agreedthat Herennius Pontius, father of the general, should be consulted byletter. He was now grown feeble through age, and had withdrawnhimself, not only from all military, but also from all civiloccupations; yet, notwithstanding the decline of his bodily strength,his mind retained its full vigour. When he heard that the Roman armieswere shut up at the Caudine forks between the two glens, beingconsulted by his son's messenger, he gave his opinion, that theyshould all be immediately dismissed from thence unhurt. On thiscounsel being rejected, and the same messenger returning a secondtime, he recommended that they should all, to a man, be put to death.When these answers, so opposite to each other, like those of anambiguous oracle, were given, although his son in particularconsidered that the powers of his father's mind, together with thoseof his body, had been impaired by age, was yet prevailed on, by thegeneral desire of all, to send for him to consult him. The old man, weare told, complied without reluctance, and was carried in a waggon tothe camp, where, when summoned to give his advice, he spoke in suchway as to make no alteration in his opinions; he only added thereasons for them. That ""by his first plan, which he esteemed the best,he meant, by an act of extraordinary kindness, to establish perpetualpeace and friendship with a most powerful nation: by the other, to putoff the return of war to the distance of many ages, during which theRoman state, after the loss of those two armies, could not easilyrecover its strength."" A third plan there was not. When his son, andthe other chiefs, went on to ask him if ""a plan of a middle kind mightnot be adopted; that they both should be dismissed unhurt, and, at thesame time, by the right of war, terms imposed on them as vanquished?""""That, indeed,"" said he, ""is a plan of such a nature, as neitherprocures friends or removes enemies. Only preserve those whom ye wouldirritate by ignominious treatment. The Romans are a race who know nothow to sit down quiet under defeat; whatever that is which the presentnecessity shall brand will rankle in their breasts for ever, and willnot suffer them to rest, until they have wreaked manifold vengeance onyour heads."" Neither of these plans was approved, and Herennius wascarried home from the camp."Book 9,Chapter 4,"In the Roman camp also, when many fruitless efforts to force apassage had been made, and they were now destitute of every means ofsubsistence, forced by necessity, they send ambassadors, who werefirst to ask peace on equal terms; which, if they did not obtain, theywere to challenge the enemy to battle. To this Pontius answered, that""the war was at an end; and since, even in their present vanquishedand captive state, they were not willing to acknowledge theirsituation, he would send them under the yoke unarmed, each with asingle garment; that the other conditions of peace should be such aswere just between the conquerors and the conquered. If their troopswould depart, and their colonies be withdrawn out of the territoriesof the Samnites; for the future, the Romans and Samnites, under atreaty of equality, shall live according to their own respective laws.On these terms he was ready to negotiate with the consuls: and if anyof these should not be accepted, he forbade the ambassadors to come tohim again."" When the result of this embassy was made known, suchgeneral lamentation suddenly arose, and such melancholy tookpossession of them, that had they been told that all were to die onthe spot, they could not have felt deeper affliction. After silencecontinued a long time, and the consuls were not able to utter a word,either in favour of a treaty so disgraceful, or against a treaty sonecessary; at length, Lucius Lentulus, who was the first among thelieutenants-general, both in respect of bravery, and of the publichonours which he had attained, addressed them thus: ""Consuls, I haveoften heard my father say, that he was the only person in the Capitolwho did not advise the senate to ransom the state from the Gauls withgold; and these he would not concur in, because they had not beenenclosed with a trench and rampart by the enemy, (who were remarkablyslothful with respect to works and raising fortifications,) andbecause they might sally forth, if not without great danger, yetwithout certain destruction. Now if, in like manner as they had it intheir power to run down from the Capitol in arms against their foe, asmen besieged have often sallied out on the besiegers, it were possiblefor us to come to blows with the enemy, either on equal or unequalground, I would not be wanting in the high quality of my father'sspirit in stating my advice. I acknowledge, indeed, that death, indefence of our country, is highly glorious; and I am ready, either todevote myself for the Roman people and the legions, or to plunge intothe midst of the enemy. But in this spot I behold my country: in thisspot, the whole of the Roman legions, and unless these choose to rushon death in defence of their own individual characters, what have theywhich can be preserved by their death? The houses of the city, somemay say, and the walls of it, and the crowd who dwell in it, by whichthe city is inhabited. But in fact, in case of the destruction of thisarmy, all these are betrayed, not preserved. For who will protectthem? An unwarlike and unarmed multitude, shall I suppose? Yes, justas they defended them against the attack of the Gauls. Will they callto their succour an army from Veii, with Camillus at its head? Here onthe spot, I repeat, are all our hopes and strength; by preservingwhich, we preserve our country; by delivering them up to death, weabandon and betray our country. But a surrender is shameful andignominious. True: but such ought to be our affection for our country,that we should save it by our own disgrace, if necessity required, asfreely as by our death. Let therefore that indignity be undergone, howgreat soever, and let us submit to that necessity which even the godsthemselves do not overcome. Go, consuls, ransom the state for arms,which your ancestors ransomed with gold."""Book 9,Chapter 5,"The consuls having gone to Pontius to confer with him, when hetalked, in the strain of a conqueror, of a treaty, they declared thatsuch could not be concluded without an order of the people, norwithout the ministry of the heralds, and the other customary rites.Accordingly the Caudine peace was not ratified by settled treaty, asis commonly believed, and even asserted by Claudius, but byconventional sureties. For what occasion would these be either forsureties or hostages in the former case, where the ratification isperformed by the imprecation, ""that whichever nation shall giveoccasion to the said terms being violated, may Jupiter strike thatnation in like manner as the swine is struck by the heralds."" Theconsuls, lieutenants-general, quaestors, and military tribunes, becamesureties; and the names of all these who became sureties are extant;where, had the business been transacted by treaty, none would haveappeared but those of the two heralds. On account of the necessarydelay of the treaty six hundred horsemen were demanded as hostages,who were to suffer death if the compact were not fulfilled; a time wasthen fixed for delivering up the hostages, and sending away the troopsdisarmed. The return of the consuls renewed the general grief in thecamp, insomuch that the men hardly refrained from offering violence tothem, ""by whose rashness,"" they said, ""they had been brought into sucha situation; and through whose cowardice they were likely to departwith greater disgrace than they came. They had employed no guidethrough the country, nor scouts; but were sent out blindly, likebeasts into a pitfall"" They cast looks on each other, viewed earnestlythe arms which they must presently surrender; while their personswould be subject to the whim of the enemy: figured to themselves thehostile yoke, the scoffs of the conquerors, their haughty looks, andfinally, thus disarmed, their march through the midst of an armed foe.In a word, they saw with horror the miserable journey of theirdishonoured band through the cities of the allies; and their returninto their own country, to their parents, whither themselves, andtheir ancestors, had so often come in triumph. Observing, that ""theyalone had been conquered without a fight, without a weapon thrown,without a wound; that they had not been permitted to draw theirswords, nor to engage the enemy. In vain had arms, in vain hadstrength, in vain had courage been given them."" While they were givingvent to such grievous reflections, the fatal hour of their disgracearrived, which was to render every circumstance still more shocking infact, than they had preconceived it in their imaginations. First, theywere ordered to go out, beyond the rampart, unarmed, and with singlegarments; then the hostages were surrendered, and carried intocustody. The lictors were next commanded to depart from the consuls,and the robes of the latter were stripped off. This excited such adegree of commiseration in the breasts of those very men, who a littlebefore, pouring execrations upon them, had proposed that they shouldbe delivered up and torn to pieces, that every one, forgetting his owncondition, turned away his eyes from that degradation of so high adignity, as from a spectacle too horrid to behold."Book 9,Chapter 6,"First, the consuls, nearly half naked, were sent under the yoke;then each officer, according to his rank, was exposed to disgrace, andthe legions successively. The enemy stood on each side under arms,reviling and mocking them; swords were pointed at most of them,several were wounded and some even slain, when their looks, renderedtoo fierce by the indignity to which they were subjected, gave offenceto the conquerors. Thus were they led under the yoke; and what wasstill more intolerable, under the eyes of the enemy. When they had gotclear of the defile, they seemed as if they had been drawn up from theinfernal regions, and then for the first time beheld the light; yet,when they viewed the ignominious appearance of the army, the lightitself was more painful to them than any kind of death could havebeen; so that although they might have arrived at Capua before night,yet, uncertain with respect to the fidelity of the allies, and becauseshame embarrassed them, in need of every thing, they threw themselvescarelessly on the ground, on each side of the road: which being toldat Capua, just compassion for their allies got the better of thearrogance natural to the Campanians. They immediately sent to theconsuls their ensigns of office, the fasces and lictors; to thesoldiers, arms, horses, clothes, and provisions in abundance: and, ontheir approach to Capua, the whole senate and people went out to meetthem, and performed every proper office of hospitality, both publicand private. But the courtesy, kind looks, and address of the allies,could not only not draw a word from them, but it could not evenprevail on them to raise their eyes, or look their consoling friendsin the face, so completely did shame, in addition to grief, obligethem to shun the conversation and society of these their friends. Nextday, when some young nobles, who had been sent from Capua, to escortthem on their road to the frontiers of Campania, returned, they werecalled into the senate-house, and, in answer to the inquiries of theelder members, said, that ""to them they seemed deeply sunk inmelancholy and dejection; that the whole body moved on in silence,almost as if dumb; the former genius of the Romans was prostrated, andthat their spirit had been taken from them, together with their arms.Not one returned a salute, nor returned an answer to those who greetedthem; as if, through fear, they were unable to utter a word; as iftheir necks still carried the yoke under which they had been sent.That the Samnites had obtained a victory, not only glorious, butlasting also; for they had subdued, not Rome merely, as the Gauls hadformerly done, but what was a much wore warlike achievement, the Romancourage."" When these remarks were made and attentively listened to,and the almost extinction of the Roman name was lamented in thisassembly of faithful allies, Ofilius Calavius, son of Ovius, a manhighly distinguished, both by his birth and conduct, and at this timefurther respectable on account of his age, is said to have declaredthat he entertained a very different opinion in the case. ""Thisobstinate silence,"" said he, ""those eyes fixed on the earth,--thoseears deaf to all comfort,--with the shame of beholding the light,--areindications of a mind calling forth, from its inmost recesses, theutmost exertions of resentment. Either he was ignorant of the temperof the Romans, or that silence would shortly excite, among theSamnites, lamentable cries and groans; for that the remembrance of theCaudine peace would be much more sorrowful to the Samnites than to theRomans. Each side would have their own native spirit, wherever theyshould happen to engage, but the Samnites would not, every where, havethe glens of Caudium."""Book 9,Chapter 7,"Their disaster was, by this time, well known at Rome also. Atfirst, they heard that the troops were shut up; afterwards the news ofthe ignominious peace caused greater affliction than had been felt fortheir danger. On the report of their being surrounded, a levy of menwas begun; but when it was understood that the army had surrendered inso disgraceful a manner, the preparations were laid aside; andimmediately, without any public directions, a general mourning tookplace, with all the various demonstrations of grief. The shops wereshut; and all business ceased in the forum, spontaneously, before itwas proclaimed. Laticlaves [Footnote: In the original, _lati clavi_.The latus clavus was a tunic, or vest, ornamented with a broad stripeof purple on the fore part, worn by the senators; the knights wore asimilar one, only ornamented with a narrower stripe. Gold rings werealso used as badges of distinction, the common people wore iron ones.]and gold rings were laid aside: and the public were in greatertribulation, if possible, than the army itself; they were not onlyenraged against the commanders, the advisers and sureties of the peace,but detested even the unoffending soldiers, and asserted, that theyought not to be admitted into the city or its habitations. But thesetransports of passion were allayed by the arrival of the troops, whichexcited compassion even in the angry; for entering into the city, notlike men returning into their country with unexpected safety, but inthe habit and with the looks of captives, late in the evening; they hidthemselves so closely in their houses, that, for the next, and severalfollowing days, not one of them could bear to come in sight of theforum, or of the public. The consuls, shut up in private, transacted noofficial business, except that which was wrung from them by a decree ofthe senate, to nominate a dictator to preside at the elections. Theynominated Quintus Fabius Ambustus, and as master of the horse PubliusAelius Paetus. But they having been irregularly appointed, there weresubstituted in their room, Marcus Aemilius Papus dictator, and LuciusValerius Flaccus master of the horse. But neither did these hold theelections: and the people being dissatisfied with all the magistratesof that year, an interregnum ensued. The interreges were, QuintusFabius Maximus and Marcus Valerius Corvus, who elected consuls QuintusPublilius Philo, and Lucius Papirius Cursor a second time; a choiceuniversally approved, for there were no commanders at that time ofhigher reputation."Book 9,Chapter 8,"They entered into office on the day they were elected, for so ithad been determined by the fathers. When the customary decrees of thesenate were passed, they proposed the consideration of the Caudinepeace; and Publilius, who was in possession of the fasces, said,""Spurius Postumius, speak:"" he arose with just the same countenancewith which he had passed under the yoke, and delivered himself to thiseffect: ""Consuls, I am well aware that I have been called up firstwith marked ignominy, not with honour; and that I am ordered to speak,not as being a senator, but as a person answerable as well for anunsuccessful war as for a disgraceful peace. However, since thequestion propounded by you is not concerning our guilt, or ourpunishment; waving a defence, which would not be very difficult,before men who are not unacquainted with human casualties ornecessities, I shall briefly state my opinion on the matter inquestion; which opinion will testify, whether I meant to spare myselfor your legions, when I engaged as surety to the convention, whetherdishonourable or necessary: by which, however, the Roman people arenot bound, inasmuch as it was concluded without their order; nor isany thing liable to be forfeited to the Samnites, in consequence ofit, except our persons. Let us then be delivered up to them by theheralds, naked, and in chains. Let us free the people of the religiousobligation, if we have bound them under any such; so that there may beno restriction, divine or human, to prevent your entering on the waranew, without violating either religion or justice. I am also ofopinion, that the consuls, in the mean time, enlist, arm, and lead outan army; but that they should not enter the enemy's territories beforeevery particular, respecting the surrender of us, be regularlyexecuted. You, O immortal gods! I pray and beseech that, although ithas not been your will that Spurius Postumius and Titus Veturius, asconsuls, should wage war with success against the Samnites, ye may yetdeem it sufficient to have seen us sent under the yoke; to have seenus bound under an infamous convention; to have seen us delivered intothe hands of our foes naked and shackled, taking on our own heads thewhole weight of the enemy's resentment. And grant, that the consulsand legions of Rome may wage war against the Samnites, with the samefortune with which every war has been waged before we became consuls.""On his concluding this speech, men's minds were so impressed with bothadmiration and compassion, that now they could scarce believe him tobe the same Spurius Postumius who had been the author of so shameful apeace; again lamenting, that such a man was likely to undergo, amongthe enemy, a punishment even beyond that of others, through resentmentfor annulling the peace. When all the members, extolling him withpraises, expressed their approbation of his sentiments, a protest wasattempted for a time by Lucius Livius and Quintus Maelius, tribunes ofthe commons, who said, that ""the people could not be acquitted of thereligious obligation by the consuls being given up, unless all thingswere restored to the Samnites in the same state in which they had beenat Caudium; nor had they themselves deserved any punishment, forhaving, by becoming sureties to the peace, preserved the army of theRoman people; nor, finally, could they, being sacred and inviolable,be surrendered to the enemy or treated with violence."""Book 9,Chapter 9,"To this Postumius replied, ""In the mean time surrender us asunsanctified persons, which ye may do, without offence to religion;those sacred and inviolable personages, the tribunes, ye willafterwards deliver up as soon as they go out of office: but, if yelisten to me, they will be first scourged with rods, here in theComitium, that they may pay this as interest for their punishmentbeing delayed. For, as to their denying that the people are acquittedof the religious obligation, by our being given up, who is there soignorant of the laws of the heralds, as not to know, that those menspeak in that manner, that they themselves may not be surrendered,rather than because the case is really so? Still I do not deny,conscript fathers, that compacts, on sureties given, are as sacred astreaties, in the eyes of all who regard faith between men, with thesame reverence which is paid to duties respecting the gods: but Iinsist, that without the order of the people, nothing can be ratifiedthat is to bind the people. Suppose that, out of the same arrogancewith which the Samnites wrung from us the convention in question, theyhad compelled us to repeat the established form of words for thesurrendering of cities, would ye, tribunes, say, that the Roman peoplewas surrendered? and, that this city, these temples, and consecratedgrounds, these lands and waters, were become the property of theSamnites? I say no more of the surrender, because our having becomesureties is the point insisted on. Now, suppose we had become suretiesthat the Roman people should quit this city; that they should set iton fire; that they should have no magistrates, no senate, no laws;that they should, in future, be ruled by kings: the gods forbid, yousay. But, the enormity of the articles lessens not the obligation of acompact. If there is any thing in which the people can be bound, itcan in all. Nor is there any importance in another circumstance, whichweighs, perhaps, with some: whether a consul, a dictator, or apraetor, be the surety. And this, indeed, was what even the Samnitesthemselves proved, who were not satisfied with the security of theconsuls, but compelled the lieutenants-general, quaestors, andmilitary tribunes to join them. Let no one, then, demand of me, why Ientered into such a compact, when neither such power was vested in aconsul, and when I could not either to them, insure a peace, of whichI could not command the ratification; or in behalf of you, who hadgiven me no powers. Conscript fathers, none of the transactions atCaudium were directed by human wisdom. The immortal gods deprived ofunderstanding both your generals and those of the enemy. On the oneside we acted not with sufficient caution in the war; on the other,they threw away a victory, which through our folly they had obtained,while they hardly confided in the places, by means of which they hadconquered; but were in haste, on any terms, to take arms out of thehands of men who were born to arms. Had their reason been sound, wouldit have been difficult, during the time which they spent in sendingfor old men from home to give them advice, to send ambassadors toRome, and to negotiate a peace and treaty with the senate, and withthe people? It would have been a journey of only three days toexpeditious travellers. In the interim, matters might have restedunder a truce, that is, until their ambassadors should have broughtfrom Rome, either certain victory or peace. That would have beenreally a compact, on the faith of sureties, for we should have becomesureties by order of the people. But, neither would ye have passedsuch an order, nor should we have pledged our faith; nor was it rightthat the affair should have any other issue, than, that they should bevainly mocked with a dream, as it were, of greater prosperity thantheir minds were capable of comprehending, and that the same fortune,which had entangled our army, should extricate it; that an ineffectualvictory should be frustrated by a more ineffectual peace; and that aconvention, on the faith of a surety, should be introduced, whichbound no other person beside the surety. For what part had ye,conscript fathers; what part had the people, in this affair? Who cancall upon you? Who can say, that he has been deceived by you? Can theenemy? Can a citizen? To the enemy ye engaged nothing. Ye ordered nocitizen to engage on your behalf. Ye are therefore no way concernedeither with us, to whom ye gave no commission; nor with the Samnites,with whom ye transacted no business. We are sureties to the Samnites;debtors, sufficiently wealthy in that which is our own, in that whichwe can offer--our bodies and our minds. On these, let them exercisetheir cruelty; against these, let them whet their resentment and theirswords. As to what relates to the tribunes, consider whether thedelivering them up can be effected at the present time, or if it mustbe deferred to another day. Meanwhile let us, Titus Veturius, and therest concerned, offer our worthless persons, as atonements for thebreaking our engagements, and, by our sufferings liberate the Romanarmies."""Book 9,Chapter 10,"Both these arguments, and, still more, the author of them,powerfully affected the senators; as they did likewise every one, notexcepting even the tribunes of the commons who declared, that theywould be directed by the senate. They then instantly resigned theiroffice, and were delivered, together with the rest, to the heralds, tobe conducted to Caudium. On passing this decree of the senate, itseemed as if some new light had shone upon the state: Postumius was inevery mouth: they extolled him to heaven; and pronounced his conductas equal even to the devoting act of the consul Publius Decius, and toother illustrious acts. ""Through his counsel, and exertions,"" theysaid, ""the state had raised up its head from an ignominious peace. Henow offered himself to the enemy's rage, and to torments; and wassuffering, in atonement for the Roman people."" All turned theirthoughts towards arms and war, [and the general cry was,] ""When shallwe be permitted with arms in our hands to meet the Samnites?"" Whilethe state glowed with resentment and rancour, the levies were composedalmost entirely of volunteers. New legions, composed of the formersoldiers, were quickly formed, and an army marched to Caudium. Theheralds, who went before, on coming to the gate, ordered the suretiesof the peace to be stripped of their clothes, and their hands to betied behind their backs. As the apparitor, out of respect to hisdignity, was binding Postumius in a loose manner, ""Why do you not,""said he, ""draw the cord tight, that the surrender may be regularlyperformed?"" Then, when they came into the assembly of the Samnites,and to the tribunal of Pontius, Aulus Cornelius Arvina, a herald,pronounced these words: ""Forasmuch as these men, here present, withoutorders from the Roman people, the Quirites, entered into surety, thata treaty should be made, and have thereby rendered themselvescriminal; now, in order that the Roman people may be freed from thecrime of impiety, I here surrender these men into your hands."" On theherald saying thus, Postumius gave him a stroke on the thigh with hisknee, as forcibly as he could, and said with a loud voice, that ""hewas now a citizen of Samnium, the other a Roman ambassador; that theherald had been, by him, violently ill-treated, contrary to the law ofnations; and that his people would therefore have the more justice ontheir side, in waging war."""Book 9,Chapter 11,"Pontius then said, ""Neither will I accept such a surrender, norwill the Samnites deem it valid. Spurius Postumius, if you believethat there are gods, why do you not undo all that has been done, orfulfil your agreement? The Samnite nation is entitled, either to allthe men whom it had in its power, or, instead of them, to a peace. Butwhy do I call on you, who, with as much regard to faith as you areable to show, return yourself a prisoner into the hands of theconqueror? I call on the Roman people. If they are dissatisfied withthe convention made at the Caudine forks, let them replace the legionswithin the defile where they were pent up. Let there be no deceptionon either side. Let all that has been done pass as nothing. Let themreceive again the army which they surrendered by the convention; letthem return into their camp. Whatever they were in possession of, theday before the conference, let them possess again. Then let war andresolute counsels be adopted. Then let the convention, and peace, berejected. Let us carry on the war in the same circumstances, andsituations, in which we were before peace was mentioned. Let neitherthe Roman people blame the convention of the consuls, nor us the faithof the Roman people. Will ye never want an excuse for not standing tothe compacts which ye make on being defeated? Ye gave hostages toPorsena: ye clandestinely withdrew them. Ye ransomed your state fromthe Gauls, for gold: while they were receiving the gold, they were putto the sword. Ye concluded a peace with us, on condition of ourrestoring your captured legions: that peace ye now annul; in fine, yealways spread over your fraudulent conduct some show of right. Do theRoman people disapprove of their legions being saved by an ignominiouspeace? Let them have their peace, and return the captured legions tothe conqueror. This would be conduct consistent with faith, withtreaties, and with the laws of the heralds. But that you should, inconsequence of the convention, obtain what you desired, the safety ofso many of your countrymen, while I obtain not, what I stipulated foron sending you back those men, a peace; is this the law which you,Aulus Cornelius, which ye, heralds, prescribe to nations? But for mypart, I neither accept those men whom ye pretend to surrender, norconsider them as surrendered; nor do I hinder them from returning intotheir own country, which stands bound under an actual convention,formally entered into carrying with them the wrath of all the gods,whose authority is thus baffled. Wage war, since Spurius Postumius hasjust now struck with his knee the herald, in character of ambassador.The gods are to believe that Postumius is a citizen of Samnium, not ofRome; and that a Roman ambassador has been violated by a Samnite; andthat therefore a just war has been waged against us by you. That menof years, and of consular dignity, should not be ashamed to exhibitsuch mockery of religion in the face of day! And should have recourseto such shallow artifices to palliate their breach of faith, unworthyeven of children! Go, lictor, take off the bonds from those Romans.Let no one delay them from departing when they think proper.""Accordingly they returned unhurt from Caudium to the Roman camp,having acquitted, certainly, their own faith, and perhaps that of thepublic."Book 9,Chapter 12,"The Samnites finding that instead of a peace which flattered theirpride, the war was revived, and with the utmost inveteracy, not onlyfelt, in their minds, a foreboding of all the consequences whichensued, but saw them, in a manner, before their eyes. They now, toolate and in vain, applauded the plans of old Pontius, by blunderingbetween which, they had exchanged the possession of victory for anuncertain peace; and having lost the opportunity of doing a kindnessor an injury, were now to fight against men, whom they might haveeither put out of the way, for ever, as enemies; or engaged, for ever,as friends. And such was the change which had taken place in men'sminds, since the Caudine peace, even before any trial of strength hadshown an advantage on either side, that Postumius, by surrenderinghimself, had acquired greater renown among the Romans, than Pontiusamong the Samnites, by his bloodless victory. The Romans consideredtheir being at liberty to make war, a certain victory; while theSamnites supposed the Romans victorious, the moment they resumed theirarms. Meanwhile, the Satricans revolted to the Samnites, who attackedthe colony of Fregellae, by a sudden surprise in the night,accompanied, as it appears, by the Satricans. From that time untilday, their mutual fears kept both parties quiet: the daylight was thesignal for battle, which the Fregellans contrived to maintain, for aconsiderable time, without loss of ground; both because they foughtfor their religion and liberty; and the multitude, who were unfit tobear arms, assisted them from the tops of the houses. At length astratagem gave the advantage to the assailants; for they suffered thevoice of a crier to be heard proclaiming, that ""whoever laid down hisarms might retire in safety."" This relaxed their eagerness in thefight, and they began almost every where to throw away their arms. Apart, more determined, however, retaining their arms, rushed out bythe opposite gate, and their boldness brought greater safety to them,than their fear, which inclined them to credulity, did to the others:for the Samnites, having surrounded the latter with fires, burned themall to death, while they made vain appeals to the faith of gods andmen. The consuls having settled the province between them, Papiriusproceeded into Apulia to Luceria where the Roman horsemen, given ashostages at Caudium were kept in custody: Publilius remained inSamnium, to oppose the Caudine legions. This proceeding perplexed theminds of the Samnites: they could not safely determine either to go toLuceria, lest the enemy should press on their rear or to remain wherethey were, lest in the mean time Luceria should be lost. Theyconcluded, therefore, that it would be most advisable to trust to thedecision of fortune, and to take the issue of a battle with Publilius:accordingly they drew out their forces into the field."Book 9,Chapter 13,"When Publilius was about to engage, considering it proper toaddress his soldiers first, he ordered an assembly be summoned. Butthough they ran together to the general's quarters with the greatestalacrity, yet so loud were the clamours, demanding the fight, thatnone of the general's exhortations were heard: each man's ownreflections on the late disgrace served as an exhortation. Theyadvanced therefore to battle, urging the standard-bearers to hasten;at rest, in beginning the conflict, there should be any delay, inwielding their javelins and then drawing their swords, they threw awaythe former, as if a signal to that purpose had been given, and,drawing the latter, rushed in full speed upon the foe. Nothing of ageneral's skill was displayed in forming ranks or reserves; theresentment of the troops performed all, with a degree of fury littleinferior to madness. The enemy, therefore, were not only completelyrouted, not even daring to embarrass their flight by retreating totheir camp but dispersing, made towards Apulia in scattered parties:afterwards, however, collecting their forces into one body, theyreached Luceria. The same exasperation, which had carried the Romansthrough the midst of the enemy's line, carried them forward also intotheir camp, where greater carnage was made, and more blood spilt, thaneven in the field, while the greater part of the spoil was destroyedin their rage. The other army, with the consul Papirius, had nowarrived at Arpi, on the sea-coast, having passed without molestationthrough all the countries in their way; which was owing to theill-treatment received by those people from the Samnites, and theirhatred towards them, rather than to any favour received from the Romanpeople. For such of the Samnites as dwelt on the mountains in separatevillages, used to ravage the low lands, and the places on the coast;and being mountaineers, and savage themselves, despised the husbandmenwho were of a gentler kind, and, as generally happens, resembled thedistrict they inhabited. Now if this tract had been favourablyaffected towards the Samnites, either the Roman army could have beenprevented from reaching Arpi, or, as it lay between Rome and Arpi, itmight have intercepted the convoys of provisions, and utterlydestroyed them by the consequent scarcity of all necessaries. Even asit was, when they went from thence to Luceria, both the besiegers andthe besieged were distressed equally by want. Every kind of supplieswas brought to the Romans from Arpi; but in so very scanty proportion,that the horsemen had to carry corn from thence to the camp, in littlebags, for the foot, who were employed in the outposts, watches, andworks; and sometimes falling in with the enemy, they were obliged tothrow the corn from off their horses, in order to fight. Before thearrival of the other consul and his victorious army, both provisionshad been brought in to the Samnites, and reinforcements conveyed in tothem from the mountains; but the coming of Publilius contracted alltheir resources; for, committing the siege to the care of hiscolleague, and keeping himself disengaged, he threw every difficultyin the way of the enemy's convoys. There being therefore little hopefor the besieged, or that they would be able much longer to endurewant, the Samnites, encamped at Luceria, were obliged to collect theirforces from every side, and come to an engagement with Papirius."Book 9,Chapter 14,"At this juncture, while both parties were preparing for an action,ambassadors from the Tarentines interposed, requiring both Samnitesand Romans to desist from war; with menaces, that ""if either refusedto agree to a cessation of hostilities, they would join their armswith the other party against them."" Papirius, on hearing the purportof their embassy, as if influenced by their words, answered, that hewould consult his colleague: he then sent for him, employing theintermediate time in the necessary preparations; and when he hadconferred with him on a matter, about which no doubt was entertained,he made the signal for battle. While the consuls were employed inperforming the religious rites and the other usual businesspreparatory to an engagement the Tarentine ambassadors put themselvesin their way, expecting an answer: to whom Papirius said, ""Tarentines,the priest reports that the auspices are favourable, and that oursacrifices have been attended with excellent omens: under thedirection of the gods, we are proceeding, as you see, to action."" Hethen ordered the standards to move, and led out the troops; thusrebuking the exorbitant arrogance of that nation, which at a timewhen, through intestine discord and sedition, it was unequal to themanagement of its own affairs, yet presumed to prescribe the bounds ofpeace and war to others. On the other side, the Samnites, who hadneglected every preparation for fighting, either because they werereally desirous of peace, or it seemed their interest to pretend to beso, in order to conciliate the favour of the Tarentines, when theysaw, on a sudden, the Romans drawn up for battle, cried out, that""they would continue to be directed by the Tarentines, and wouldneither march out, nor carry their arms beyond the rampart. That ifdeceived, they would rather endure any consequence which chance maybring, than show contempt to the Tarentines, the advisers of peace.""The consuls said that ""they embraced the omen, and prayed that theenemy might continue in the resolution of not even defending theirrampart."" Then, dividing the forces between them, they advanced to theworks; and, making an assault on every side at once, while some filledup the trenches, others tore down the rampart, and tumbled it into thetrench. All were stimulated, not only by their native courage, but bythe resentment which, since their disgrace, had been festering intheir breasts. They made their way into the camp; where, every onerepeating, that here was not Caudium, nor the forks, nor theimpassable glens, where cunning haughtily triumphed over error; butRoman valour, which no rampart nor trench could ward off;--they slew,without distinction, those who resisted and those who fled, the armedand unarmed, freemen and slaves, young and old, men and cattle. Norwould a single animal have escaped, had not the consuls given thesignal for retreat; and, by commands and threats, forced out of thecamp the soldiers, greedy of slaughter. As they were highly incensedat being thus interrupted in the gratification of their vengeance, aspeech was immediately addressed to them, assuring the soldiers, that""the consuls neither did nor would fall short of any one of thesoldiers, in hatred toward the enemy; on the contrary, as they led theway in battle, so would they have done the same in executing unboundedvengeance, had not the consideration of the six hundred horsemen, whowere confined as hostages in Luceria, restrained their inclinations;lest total despair of pardon might drive on the enemy blindly to takevengeance on them, eager to destroy them before they themselves shouldperish."" The soldiers highly applauded this conduct, and rejoiced thattheir resentment had been checked, and acknowledged that every thingought to be endured, rather than that the safety of so many Romanyouths of the first distinction should be brought into danger."Book 9,Chapter 15,"The assembly being then dismissed, a consultation was held,whether they should press forward the siege of Luceria, with all theirforces; or, whether with one of the commanders, and his army, trialshould be made of the Apulians, a nation in the neighbourhood stilldoubtful. The consul Publilius set out to make a circuit throughApulia, and in the one expedition either reduced by force, or receivedinto alliance on conditions, a considerable number of the states.Papirius likewise, who had remained to prosecute the siege of Luceria,soon found the event agreeable to his hopes: for all the roads beingblocked up through which provisions used to be conveyed from Samnium,the Samnites, who were in garrison, were reduced so low by famine,that they sent ambassadors to the Roman consul, proposing that heshould raise the siege, on receiving the horsemen who were the causeof the war, to whom Papirius returned this answer, that ""they ought tohave consulted Pontius, son of Herennius, by whose advice they hadsent the Romans under the yoke, what treatment he thought fitting forthe conquered to undergo. But since, instead of offering fair termsthemselves, they chose rather that they should be imposed on them bytheir enemies, he desired them to carry back orders to the troops inLuceria, that they should leave within the walls their arms, baggage,beasts of burthen, and all persons unfit for war. The soldiers hewould send under the yoke with single garments, retaliating thedisgrace formerly inflicted, not inflicting a new one."" The terms werenot rejected. Seven thousand soldiers were sent under the yoke, and animmense booty was seized in Luceria, all the standards and arms whichthey had lost at Caudium being recovered; and, what greatly surpassedall their joy, recovered the horsemen whom the Samnites had sent toLuceria to be kept as pledges of the peace. Hardly ever did the Romansgain a victory more distinguished for the sudden reverse produced inthe state of their affairs; especially if it be true, as I find insome annals, that Pontius, son of Herennius, the Samnite general, wassent under the yoke along with the rest, to atone for the disgrace ofthe consuls. I think it indeed more strange that there should existany doubt whether it was Lucius Cornelius, in quality of dictator,Lucius Papirius Cursor being master of the horse, who performed theseachievements at Caudium, and afterwards at Luceria, as the singleavenger of the disgrace of the Romans, enjoying the best deservedtriumph, perhaps, next to that of Furius Camillus, which had ever yetbeen obtained; or whether that honour belongs to the consuls, andparticularly to Papirius. This uncertainty is followed by another,whether, at the next election, Papirius Cursor was chosen consul athird time, with Quintus Aulus Ceretanus a second time, beingre-elected in requital of his services at Luceria; or whether it wasLucius Papirius Mugillanus, the surname being mistaken."Book 9,Chapter 16,"From henceforth, the accounts are clear, that the other wars wereconducted to a conclusion by the consuls. Aulius by one successfulbattle, entirely conquered the Forentans. The city, to which theirarmy had retreated after its defeat, surrendered on terms, hostageshaving been demanded. With similar success the other consul conductedhis operations against the Satricans; who, though Roman citizens, had,after the misfortune at Caudium, revolted to the Samnites, andreceived a garrison into their city. The Satricans, however, when theRoman army approached their walls, sent deputies to sue for peace,with humble entreaties; to whom the consul answered harshly, that""they must not come again to him, unless they either put to death, ordelivered up, the Samnite garrison:"" by which terms greater terror wasstruck into the colonists than by the arms with which they werethreatened. The deputies, accordingly, several times asking theconsul, how he thought that they, who were few and weak, could attemptto use force against a garrison so strong and well-armed: he desiredthem to ""seek counsel from those, by whose advice they had receivedthat garrison into the city."" They then departed, and returned totheir countrymen, having obtained from the consul, with muchdifficulty, permission to consult their senate on the matter, andbring back their answer to him. Two factions divided the senate; onethat whose leaders had been the authors of the defection from theRoman people, the other consisted of the citizens who retained theirloyalty; both, however, showed an earnest desire, that every meansshould be used towards effecting an accommodation with the consul forthe restoration of peace. As the Samnite garrison, being in no respectprepared for holding out a siege, intended to retire the next nightout of the town, one party thought it sufficient to discover to theconsul, at what hour, through what gate, and by what road, his enemywas to march out. The other, against whose wishes defection to theSamnites had occurred, even opened one of the gates for the consul inthe night, secretly admitting the armed enemy into the town. Inconsequence of this twofold treachery, the Samnite garrison wassurprised and overpowered by an ambush, placed in the woody places,near the road; and, at the same time, a shout was raised in the city,which was now filled with the enemy. Thus, in the short space of onehour, the Samnites were put to the sword, the Satricans madeprisoners, and all things reduced under the power of the consul; who,having instituted an inquiry by whose means the revolt had takenplace, scourged with rods and beheaded such as he found to be guilty;and then, disarming the Satricans, he placed a strong garrison in theplace. On this those writers state, that Papirius Cursor proceeded toRome to celebrate his triumph, who say, that it was under his guidanceLuceria was retaken, and the Samnites sent under the yoke.Undoubtedly, as a warrior, he was deserving of every military praise,excelling not only in vigour of mind, but likewise in strength ofbody. He possessed extraordinary swiftness of foot, surpassing everyone of his age in running, from whence came the surname into hisfamily; and he is said, either from the robustness of his frame, orfrom much practice, to have been able to digest a very large quantityof food and wine. Never did either the foot-soldier or horseman feelmilitary service more laborious, under any general, because he was ofa constitution not to be overcome by fatigue. The cavalry, on someoccasion, venturing to request that, in consideration of their goodbehaviour, he would excuse them some part of their business, he toldthem, ""Ye should not say that no indulgence has been granted you,--Iexcuse you from rubbing your horses' backs when ye dismount."" Hesupported also the authority of command, in all its vigour, both amongthe allies and his countrymen. The praetor of Praeneste, through fear,had been tardy in bringing forward his men from the reserve to thefront: he, walking before his tent, ordered him to be called, and thenbade the lictor to make ready his axe, on which, the Praenestinestanding frightened almost to death, he said, ""Here, lictor, cut awaythis stump, it is troublesome to people as they walk;"" and, after thusalarming him with the dread of the severest punishment, he imposed afine and dismissed him. It is beyond doubt, that during that age, thanwhich none was ever more productive of virtuous characters, there wasno man in whom the Roman affairs found a more effectual support; nay,people even marked him out, in their minds, as a match for Alexanderthe Great, in case that, having completed the conquest of Asia, heshould have turned his arms on Europe."Book 9,Chapter 17,"Nothing can be found farther from my intention, since thecommencement of this history, than to digress, more than necessityrequired, from the course of narration; and, by embellishing my workwith variety, to seek pleasing resting-places, as it were, for myreaders, and relaxation for my own mind: nevertheless, the mentionof so great a king and commander, now [editorial note: there isreason to believe that one or two lines of text might be missing atthis point] calls forth to public view those silent reflections,whom Alexander must have fought. Manlius Torquatus, had he methim in the field, might, perhaps, have yielded to Alexander indischarging military duties in battle (for these also renderhim no less illustrious); and so might Valerius Corvus; men whowere distinguished soldiers, before they became commanders. The same,too, might have been the case with the Decii, who, after devotingtheir persons, rushed upon the enemy; or of Papirius Cursor, thoughpossessed of such powers, both of body and mind. By the counsels ofone youth, it is possible the wisdom of a whole senate, not to mentionindividuals, might have been baffled, [consisting of such members,]that he alone, who declared that ""it consisted of kings,"" conceived acorrect idea of a Roman senate. But then the danger was, that withmore judgment than any one of those whom I have named he might chooseground for an encampment, provide supplies, guard against stratagems,distinguish the season for fighting, form his line of battle, orstrengthen it properly with reserves. He would have owned that he wasnot dealing with Darius, who drew after him a train of women andeunuchs; saw nothing about him but gold and purple; was encumberedwith the trappings of his state, and should be called his prey, ratherthan his antagonist; whom therefore he vanquished without loss ofblood and had no other merit, on the occasion, than that of showing aproper spirit in despising empty show. The aspect of Italy would haveappeared to him of a quite different nature from that of India, whichhe traversed in the guise of a traveller, at the head of a crew ofdrunkards, if he had seen the forests of Apulia, and the mountains ofLucania, with the vestiges of the disasters of his house, and wherehis uncle Alexander, king of Epirus, had been lately cut off."Book 9,Chapter 18,"We are now speaking of Alexander not yet intoxicated byprosperity, the seductions of which no man was less capable ofwithstanding. But, if he is to be judged from the tenor of his conductin the new state of his fortune, and from the new disposition, as Imay say, which he put on after his successes, he would have enteredItaly more like Darius than Alexander; and would have brought thitheran army that had forgotten Macedonia, and were degenerating into themanners of the Persians. It is painful, in speaking of so great aking, to recite his ostentatious change of dress; of requiring thatpeople should address him with adulation, prostrating themselves onthe ground, a practice insupportable to the Macedonians, had they evenbeen conquered, much more so when they were victorious; the shockingcruelty of his punishments; his murdering his friends in the midst offeasting and wine; with the folly of his fiction respecting his birth.What must have been the consequence, if his love of wine had dailybecome more intense? if his fierce and uncontrollable anger? And as Imention not any one circumstance of which there is a doubt amongwriters, do we consider these as no disparagements to thequalifications of a commander? But then, as is frequently repeated bythe silliest of the Greeks, who are fond of exalting the reputation,even of the Parthians, at the expense of the Roman name, the dangerwas that the Roman people would not have had resolution to bear upagainst the splendour of Alexander's name, who, however, in myopinion, was not known to them even by common fame; and while, inAthens, a state reduced to weakness by the Macedonian arms, which atthe very time saw the ruins of Thebes smoking in its neighbourhood,men had spirit enough to declaim with freedom against him, as ismanifest from the copies of their speeches, which have been preserved;[we are to be told] that out of such a number of Roman chiefs, no onewould have freely uttered his sentiments. How great soever our idea ofthis man's greatness may be, still it is the greatness of anindividual, constituted by the successes of a little more than tenyears; and those who give it pre-eminence on account that the Romanpeople have been defeated, though not in any entire war, yet inseveral battles, whereas Alexander was never once unsuccessful in asingle fight, do not consider that they are comparing the actions ofone man, and that a young man, with the exploits of a nation wagingwars now eight hundred years. Can we wonder if, when on the one sidemore ages are numbered than years on the other, fortune varied more inso long a lapse of time than in the short term of thirteen years?[Footnote: The duration of Alexander's military career.] But why notcompare the success of one general with that of another? How manyRoman commanders might I name who never lost a battle? In the annalsof the magistrates, and the records, we may run over whole pages ofconsuls and dictators, with whose bravery, and successes also, theRoman people never once had reason to be dissatisfied. And whatrenders them more deserving of admiration than Alexander, or any king,is, that some of these acted in the office of dictator, which lastedonly ten, or it might be twenty days, none, in a charge of longerduration than the consulship of a year; their levies obstructed byplebeian tribunes; often late in taking the field; recalled, beforethe time, on account of elections; amidst the very busiest efforts ofthe campaign, their year of office expired; sometimes the rashness,sometimes the perverseness of a colleague, proving an impediment ordetriment; and finally succeeding to the unfortunate administration ofa predecessor, with an army of raw or ill-disciplined men. But, onthe other hand, kings, being not only free from every kind ofimpediment, but masters of circumstances and seasons, control allthings in subserviency to their designs, themselves uncontrolled byany. So that Alexander, unconquered, would have encounteredunconquered commanders; and would have had stakes of equal consequencepledged on the issue. Nay, the hazard had been greater on his side;because the Macedonians would have had but one Alexander, who was notonly liable, but fond of exposing himself to casualties; the Romanswould have had many equal to Alexander, both in renown, and in thegreatness of their exploits; any one of whom might live or dieaccording to his destiny, without any material consequence to thepublic."Book 9,Chapter 19,"It remains that the forces be compared together, with respect totheir numbers, the quality of the men, and the supplies ofauxiliaries. Now, in the general surveys of the age, there were ratedtwo hundred and fifty thousand men, so that, on every revolt of theLatin confederates, ten legions were enlisted almost entirely in thecity levy. It often happened during those years, that four or fivearmies were employed at a time, in Etruria, in Umbria, the Gauls toobeing at war, in Samnium, in Lucania. Then as to all Latium, with theSabines, and Volscians, the Aequans, and all Campania; half of Umbria,Etruria, and the Picentians, Marsians, Pelignians, Vestinians, andApulians; to whom may add, the whole coast of the lower sea, possessedby the Greeks, from Thurii to Neapolis and Cumae; and the Samnitesfrom thence as far as Antium and Ostia: all these he would have foundeither powerful allies to the Romans or deprived of power by theirarms. He would have crossed the sea with his veteran Macedonians,amounting to no more than thirty thousand infantry and four thousandhorse, these mostly Thessalians. This was the whole of his strength.Had he brought with him Persians and Indians, and those other nations,it would be dragging after him an encumbrance other than a support.Add to this, that the Romans, being at home, would have had recruitsat hand: Alexander, waging war in a foreign country, would have foundhis army worn out with long service, as happened afterwards toHannibal. As to arms, theirs were a buckler and long spears; those ofthe Romans, a shield, which covered the body more effectually, and ajavelin, a much more forcible weapon than the spear, either inthrowing or striking. The soldiers, on both sides, were used to steadycombat, and to preserve their ranks. But the Macedonian phalanx wasunapt for motion, and composed of similar parts throughout: the Romanline less compact, consisting of several various parts, was easilydivided as occasion required, and as easily conjoined. Then whatsoldier is comparable to the Roman in the throwing up of works? whobetter calculated to endure fatigue? Alexander, if overcome in onebattle, would have been overcome in war. The Roman, whom Claudium,whom Cannae, did not crush, what line of battle could crush? In truth,even should events have been favourable to him at first, he would haveoften wished for the Persians, the Indians, and the effeminate tribesof Asia, as opponents; and would have acknowledged, that his wars hadbeen waged with women, as we are told was said by Alexander, king ofEpirus, after receiving his mortal wound, when comparing the warswaged in Asia by this very youth, with those in which himself had beenengaged. Indeed, when I reflect that, in the first Punic war, acontest was maintained by the Romans with the Carthaginians, at sea,for twenty-four years, I can scarcely suppose that the life ofAlexander would have been long enough for the finishing of one war[with either of those nations]. And perhaps, as both the Punic statewas united to the Roman by ancient treaties, and as similarapprehensions might arm against a common foe those two nations themost potent of the time in arms and in men, he might have beenoverwhelmed in a Punic and a Roman war at once. The Romans have hadexperience of the boasted prowess of the Macedonians in arms, notindeed under Alexander as their general, or when their power was atthe height, but in the wars against Antiochus, Philip, and Perses; andnot only not with any losses, but not even with any danger tothemselves. Let not my assertion give offence, nor our civil wars bebrought into mention; never were we worsted by an enemy's cavalry,never by their infantry, never in open fight, never on equal ground,much less when the ground was favourable. Our soldiers, heavy ladenwith arms, may reasonably fear a body of cavalry, or arrows; defilesof difficult passage, and places impassable to convoys. But they havedefeated, and will defeat a thousand armies, more formidable thanthose of Alexander and the Macedonians, provided that the same love ofpeace and solicitude about domestic harmony, in which we now live,continue permanent."Book 9,Chapter 20,"Marcus Foslius Flaccinator and Lucius Plautius Venno were the nextraised to the consulship. In this year ambassadors came from most ofthe states of the Samnites to procure a renewal of the treaty; and,after they had moved the compassion of the senate, by prostratingthemselves before them, on being referred to the people, they foundnot their prayers so efficacious. The treaty therefore, being refused,after they had importuned them individually for several days, wasobtained. The Teaneans likewise, and Canusians of Apulia, worn out bythe devastations of their country, surrendered themselves to theconsul, Lucius Plautius, and gave hostages. This year praefects firstbegan to be created for Capua, and a code of laws was given to thatnation, by Lucius Furius the praetor; both in compliance with theirown request, as a remedy for the disorder of their affairs, occasionedby intestine dissensions. At Rome, two additional tribes wereconstituted, the Ufentine and Falerine. On the affairs of Apuliafalling into decline, the Teatians of that country came to the newconsuls, Caius Junius Bubulcus, and Quintus Aemilius Barbula, suingfor an alliance; and engaging, that peace should be observed towardsthe Romans through every part of Apulia. By pledging themselves boldlyfor this, they obtained the grant of an alliance, not however on termsof equality, but of their submitting to the dominion of the Romanpeople. Apulia being entirely reduced, (for Junius had also gainedpossession of Forentum, a town of great strength,) the consulsadvanced into Lucania; there Nerulum was surprised and stormed by thesudden advance of the consul Aemilius. When fame had spread abroadamong the allies, how firmly the affairs of Capua were settled by [theintroduction of] the Roman institutions, the Antians, imitating theexample, presented a complaint of their being without laws, andwithout magistrates; on which the patrons of the colony itself wereappointed by the senate to form a body of laws for it. Thus not onlythe arms, but the laws, of Rome became extensively prevalent."Book 9,Chapter 21,"The consuls, Caius Junius Bubulcus and Quintus Aemilius Barbula,at the conclusion of the year, delivered over the legions, not to theconsuls elected by themselves, who were Spurius Nautius and MarcusPopillius, but to a dictator, Lucius Aemilius. He, with LuciusFulvius, master of the horse, having commenced to lay siege toSaticula, gave occasion to the Samnites of reviving hostilities. Hencea twofold alarm was occasioned to the Roman army. On one side, theSamnites having collected a numerous force to relieve their alliesfrom the siege, pitched their camp at a small distance from that ofthe Romans: on the other side, the Saticulans, opening suddenly theirgates, ran up with violent tumult to the posts of the enemy.Afterwards, each party, relying on support from the other, more thanon its own strength, formed a regular attack, and pressed on theRomans. The dictator, on his part, though obliged to oppose twoenemies at once, yet had his line secure on both sides; for he bothchose a position not easily surrounded, and also formed two differentfronts. However, he directed his greater efforts against those who hadsallied from the town, and, without much resistance, drove them backwithin the walls. He then turned his whole force against the Samnites:there he found greater difficulty. But the victory, though longdelayed, was neither doubtful nor alloyed by losses. The Samnites,being forced to fly into their camp, extinguished their fires atnight, and marched away in silence; and renouncing all hopes ofrelieving Saticula, sat themselves down before Plistia, which was inalliance with the Romans, that they might, if possible, retort equalvexation on their enemy."Book 9,Chapter 22,"The year coming to a conclusion, the war was thenceforwardconducted by a dictator, Quintius Fabius. The new consuls, LuciusPapirius Cursor and Quintus Publilius Philo, both a fourth time, asthe former had done, remained at Rome. Fabius came with areinforcement to Saticula, to receive the army from Aemilius. For theSamnites had not continued before Plistia; but having sent for a newsupply of men from home, and relying on their numbers, had encamped inthe same spot as before; and, by provoking the Romans to battle,endeavoured to divert them from the siege. The dictator, so much themore intently, pushed forward his operations against thefortifications of the enemy; considering that only as war which wasdirected against the city, and showing an indifference with respect tothe Samnites, except that he placed guards in proper places, toprevent any attempt on his camp. The more furiously did the Samnitesride up to the rampart, and allowed him no quiet. When the enemy werenow come up close to the gates of the camp, Quintus Aulius Cerretanus,master of the horse, without consulting the dictator, sallied outfuriously at the head of all the troops of cavalry, and drove back theenemy. In this desultory kind of fight, fortune worked up the strengthof the combatants in such a manner, as to occasion an extraordinaryloss on both sides, and the remarkable deaths of the commandersthemselves. First, the general of the Samnites, indignant at beingrepulsed, and compelled to fly from a place to which he had advancedso confidently, by entreating and exhorting his horsemen, renewed thebattle. As he was easily distinguished among the horsemen, while heurged on the fight, the Roman master of the horse galloped up againsthim, with his spear directed, so furiously, that, with one stroke, hetumbled him lifeless from his horse. The multitude, however, were not,as is generally the case, dismayed by the fall of their leader, butrather raised to fury. All who were within reach darted their weaponsat Aulius, who incautiously pushed forward among the enemy's troops;but the chief share of the honour of revenging the death of theSamnite general they assigned to his brother; he, urged by rage andgrief, dragged down the victorious master of the horse from his seat,and slew him. Nor were the Samnites far from obtaining his body also,as he had fallen among the enemies' troops: but the Romans instantlydismounted, and the Samnites were obliged to do the same; and linesbeing thus formed suddenly but, at the same time, untenable throughscarcity of necessaries: ""for all the country round, from whichprovisions could be supplied, has revolted; and besides, even were theinhabitants disposed to aid us, the ground is unfavourable. I will nottherefore mislead you by leaving a camp here, into which ye mayretreat, as on a former day, without completing the victory. Worksought to be secured by arms, not arms by works. Let those keep a camp,and repair to it, whose interest it is to protract the war; but let uscut off from ourselves every other prospect but that of conquering.Advance the standards against the enemy; as soon as the troops shallhave marched beyond the rampart, let those who have it in orders burnthe camp. Your losses, soldiers, shall be compensated with the spoilof all the nations round who have revolted."" The soldiers advancedagainst the enemy with spirit inflamed by the dictator's discourse,which seemed indication of an extreme necessity; and, at the sametime, the very sight of the camp burning behind them, though thenearest part only was set on fire, (for so the dictator had ordered,)was small incitement: rushing on therefore like madmen, theydisordered the enemy's battalions at the very first onset; and themaster of the horse, when he saw at a distance the fire in the camp,which was a signal agreed on, made a seasonable attack on their rear.The Samnites, thus surrounded on either side, fled different ways. Avast number, who had gathered into a body through fear, yet fromconfusion incapable of fleeing, were surrounded and cut to pieces. Theenemy's camp was taken and plundered; and the soldiers being ladenwith spoil, the dictator led them back to the Roman camp, highlyrejoiced at the success, but by no means so much as at finding,contrary to their expectation, every thing there safe, except a smallpart only, which was injured or destroyed by the fire."Book 9,Chapter 23,"They then marched back to Sora; and the new consuls, MarcusPoetelius and Caius Sulpicius, receive the army from the dictatorFabius, discharging a great part of the veteran soldiers, havingbrought with them new cohorts to supply their place. Now while, onaccount of the dire situation of the city, no certain mode of attackcould be devised, and success must either be distant in time, or atdesperate risk; a deserter from Sora came out of the town privately bynight, and when he had got as far as the Roman watches, desired to beconducted instantly to the consuls: which being complied with, he madethem an offer of delivering the place into their hands. When heanswered their questions, respecting the means by which he intended tomake good his promise, appearing to state a project by no means idle,he persuaded them to remove the Roman camp, which was almost close tothe walls, to the distance of six miles; that the consequence would bethat this would render the guards by day, and the watches by night,the less vigilant. He then desired that some cohorts should postthemselves the following night in the woody places under the town, andtook with himself ten chosen soldiers, through steep and almostimpassable ways, into the citadel, where a quantity of missive weaponshad been collected, larger than bore proportion to the number of men.There were stones besides, some lying at random, as in all craggyplaces, and others heaped up designedly by the townsmen, to add to thesecurity of the place. Having posted the Romans here, and shown them asteep and narrow path leading up from the town to the citadel--""Fromthis ascent,"" said he, ""even three armed men would keep off anymultitude whatever. Now ye are ten in number; and, what is more,Romans, and the bravest among the Romans. The night is in your favour,which, from the uncertainty it occasions, magnifies every object topeople once alarmed. I will immediately fill every place with terror:be ye alert in defending the citadel."" He then ran down in haste,crying aloud, ""To arms, citizens, we are undone, the citadel is takenby the enemy; run, defend it."" This he repeated, as he passed thedoors of the principal men, the same to all whom he met, and also tothose who ran out in a fright into the streets. The alarm,communicated first by one, was soon spread by numbers through all thecity. The magistrates, dismayed on hearing from scouts that thecitadel was full of arms and armed men, whose number they multiplied,laid aside all hopes of recovering it. All places are filled withterror: the gates are broken open by persons half asleep, and for themost part unarmed, through one of which the body of Roman troops,roused by the noise, burst in, and slew the terrified inhabitants, whoattempted to skirmish in the streets. Sora was now taken, when, at thefirst light, the consuls arrived, and accepted the surrender of thosewhom fortune had left remaining after the flight and slaughter of thenight. Of these, they conveyed in chains to Rome two hundred andtwenty-five, whom all men agreed in pointing out as the authors, bothof the revolt, and also of the horrid massacre of the colonists. Therest they left in safety at Sora, a garrison being placed there. Allthose who were brought to Rome were beaten with rods in the forum, andbeheaded, to the great joy of the commons, whose interest it mosthighly concerned, that the multitudes, sent to various places incolonies should be in safety."Book 9,Chapter 24,"They then marched back to Sora; and the new consuls, MarcusPoetelius and Caius Sulpicius, receive the army from the dictatorFabius, discharging a great part of the veteran soldiers, havingbrought with them new cohorts to supply their place.

Allthose who were brought to Rome were beaten with rods in the forum, andbeheaded, to the great joy of the commons, whose interest it mosthighly concerned, that the multitudes, sent to various places incolonies should be in safety."Book 9,Chapter 25,"The consuls, leaving Sora, turned their warlike operations againstthe lands and cities of the Ausonians; for all places had been set incommotion by the coming of the Samnites, when the battle was fought atLautulae: conspiracies likewise had been formed in several parts ofCampania; nor was Capua itself clear of the charge: nay, the businessspread even to Rome, and inquiries came to be instituted respectingsome of the principal men there. However, the Ausonian nation fellinto the Roman power, in the same manner as Sora, by their citiesbeing betrayed: these were Ausona Minturnae, and Vescia. Certain youngmen, of the principal families, twelve in number, having conspired tobetray their respective cities, came to the consuls; they informedthem that their countrymen, who had for a long time before honestlywished for the coming of the Samnites, on hearing of the battle atLautulae, had looked on the Romans as defeated, and had assisted theSamnites with supplies of young men and arms; but that, since theSamnites had been beaten out of the country, they were waveringbetween peace and war, not shutting their gates against the Romans,lest they should thereby invite an attack; yet determined to shut themif an army should approach; that in that fluctuating state they mighteasily be overpowered by surprise. By these men's advice the camp wasmoved nearer; and soldiers were sent, at the same time, to each of thethree towns; some armed, who were to lie concealed in places near thewalls; others, in the garb of peace, with swords hidden under theirclothes, when, on the opening of the gates at the approach of day,were to enter into the cities. These latter began with killing theguards; at the same time, a signal was made to the men with arms, tohasten up from the ambuscades. Thus the gates were seized, and thethree towns taken in the same hour and by the same device. But as theattacks were made in the absence of the generals, there were no boundsto the carnage which ensued; and the nation of the Ausonians, whenthere was scarcely any clear proof of the charge of its havingrevolted, was utterly destroyed, as if it had supported a contestthrough a deadly war."Book 9,Chapter 26,"During this year, Luceria fell into the hands of the Samnites, theRoman garrison being betrayed to the enemy. This matter did not longgo unpunished with the traitors: the Roman army was not far off, bywhom the city, which lay in a plain, was taken at the first onset. TheLucerians and Samnites were to a man put to the sword; and to such alength was resentment carried, that at Rome, on the senate beingconsulted about sending a colony to Luceria, many voted for thedemolition of it. Besides, their hatred was of the bitterest kind,against a people whom they had been obliged twice to subdue by arms;the great distance, also, made them averse from sending away theircitizens among nations so ill-affected towards them. However theresolution was carried, that the colonists should be sent; andaccordingly two thousand five hundred were transported thither. Thisyear, when all places were becoming disaffected to the Romans, secretconspiracies were formed among the leading men at Capua, as well as atother places; a motion concerning which being laid before the senate,the matter was by no means neglected. Inquiries were decreed, and itwas resolved that a dictator should be appointed to enforce theseinquiries. Caius Maenius was accordingly nominated, and he appointedMarcus Foslius master of the horse. People's dread of that office wasvery great, insomuch that the Calavii, Ovius and Novius, who were theheads of the conspiracy, either through fear of the dictator's power,or the consciousness of guilt, previous to the charge against thembeing laid in form before him, avoided, as appeared beyond doubt,trial by a voluntary death. As the subject of the inquiry in Campaniawas thus removed, the proceedings were then directed towards Rome: byconstruing the order of the senate to have meant, that inquiry shouldbe made, not specially who at Capua, but generally who at any placehad caballed or conspired against the state; for that cabals, for theattaining of honours, were contrary to the edicts of the state. Theinquiry was extended to a greater latitude, with respect both to thematter, and to the kind of persons concerned, the dictator scruplingnot to avow, that his power of research was unlimited: in consequence,some of the nobility were called to account; and though they appliedto the tribunes for protection, no one interposed in their behalf, orto prevent the charges from being received. On this the nobles, notthose only against whom the charge was levelled, but the whole bodyjointly insisted that such an imputation lay not against the nobles,to whom the way to honours lay open if not obstructed by fraud, butagainst the new men: so that even the dictator and master of thehorse, with respect to that question, would appear more properly asculprits than suitable inquisitors; and this they should know as soonas they went out of office. Then indeed Maenius, who was moresolicitous about his character than his office, advanced into theassembly and spoke to this effect, ""Romans, both of my past life yeare all witnesses; and this honourable office, which ye conferred onme, is in itself a testimony of my innocence. For the dictator, properto be chosen for holding these inquiries, was not, as on many otheroccasions, where the exigencies of the state so required, the man whowas most renowned in war; but him whose counsel of life was mostremote from such cabals. But certain of the nobility (for what reasonit is more proper that ye should judge than that I, as a magistrate,should, without proof, insinuate) have laboured to stifle entirely theinquiries; and then, finding their strength unequal to it, rather thanstand a trial have fled for refuge to the stronghold of theiradversaries, an appeal and the support of the tribunes; and on beingthere also repulsed, (so fully were they persuaded that every othermeasure was safer than the attempt to clear themselves,) have made anattack upon us; and, though in private characters have not beenashamed of instituting a criminal process against a dictator. Now,that gods and men may perceive that they to avoid a scrutiny as totheir own conduct, attempt even things which are impossible, and thatI willingly meet the charge, and face the accusations of my enemies, Idivest myself of the dictatorship. And, consuls, I beseech you, thatif this business is put into your hands by the senate, ye make me andMarcus Foslius the first objects of our your examinations; that it maybe manifested that we are safe from such imputations by our owninnocence, not by the dignity of office."" He then abdicated thedictatorship, as did Marcus Foslius, immediately after, his office ofmaster of the horse; and being the first brought to trial before theconsuls, for to them the senate had committed the business, they weremost honourably acquitted of all the charges brought by the nobles.Even Publilius Philo, who had so often been invested with the highesthonours, and had performed so many eminent services, both at home andabroad, being disagreeable to the nobility, was brought to trial, andacquitted. Nor did the inquiry continue respectable on account of theillustrious names of the accused, longer than while it was new, whichis usually the case; it then began to descend to persons of inferiorrank; and, at length, was suppressed, by means of those factions andcabals against which it had been instituted."Book 9,Chapter 27,"The accounts received of these matters, but more especially thehope of a revolt in Campania, for which a conspiracy had been formed,recalled the Samnites, who were turning towards Apulia, back toCaudium; so that from thence, being near, they might, if any commotionshould open them an opportunity, snatch Capua out of the hands of theRomans. To the same place the consuls repaired with a powerful army.They both held back for some time, on the different sides of thedefiles, the roads being dangerous to either party. Then the Samnites,making a short circuit through an open tract, marched down theirtroops into level ground in the Campanian plains, and there thehostile camps first came within view of each other. Trial of theirstrength in slight skirmishes was made on both sides, more frequentlybetween the horse than the foot; and the Romans were no waydissatisfied either at the issue of these, or at the delay by whichthey protracted the war. The Samnite generals, on the contrary,considered that their battalions were becoming weakened daily by smalllosses, and the general vigour abated by prolonging the war. Theytherefore marched into the field, disposing their cavalry on bothwings, with orders to give more heedful attention to the camp behindthan to the battle; for that the line of infantry would be able toprovide for their own safety. The consuls took post, Sulpicius on theright wing, Poetelius on the left. The right wing was stretched outwider than usual, where the Samnites also stood formed in thin ranks,either with design of turning the flank of the enemy, or to avoidbeing themselves surrounded. On the left, besides that they wereformed in more compact order, an addition was made to their strength,by a sudden act of the consul Poetelius; for the subsidiary cohorts,which were usually reserved for the exigencies of a tedious fight, hebrought up immediately to the front, and, in the first onset, pushedthe enemy with the whole of his force. The Samnite line of infantrygiving way, their cavalry advanced to support them; and as they werecharging in an oblique direction between the two lines, the Romanhorse, coming up at full speed, disordered their battalions and ranksof infantry and cavalry, so as to oblige the whole line on that sideto give ground. The left wing had not only the presence of Poeteliusto animate them, but that of Sulpicius likewise; who, on the shoutbeing first raised in that quarter, rode thither from his owndivision, which had not yet engaged. When he saw victory no longerdoubtful there, he returned to his own post with twelve hundred men,but found the state of things there very different; the Romans drivenfrom their ground, and the victorious enemy pressing on them thusdismayed. However, the arrival of the consul effected a speedy changein every particular; for, on the sight of their leader, the spirit ofthe soldiers was revived, and the bravery of the men who came with himrendered them more powerful aid than even their number; while the newsof success in the other wing, which was heard, and after seen,restored the fight. From this time, the Romans became victoriousthrough the whole extent of the line, and the Samnites, giving up thecontest, were slain or taken prisoners, except such as made theirescape to Maleventum, the town which is now called Beneventum. It isrecorded that thirty thousand of the Samnites were slain or taken."Book 9,Chapter 28,"The consuls, after this important victory, led forward the legionsto lay siege to Bovianum; and there they passed the winter quarters,until Caius Poetelius, being nominated dictator, with Marcus Foslius,master of the horse, received the command of the army from the newconsuls, Lucius Papirius Cursor a fifth, and Caius Junius Bubulcus asecond time. On hearing that the citadel of Fregellae was taken by theSamnites, he left Bovianum, and proceeded to Fregellae, whence, havingrecovered possession of it without any contest, the Samnitesabandoning it in the night, and having placed a strong garrison there,he returned to Campania, directing his operations principally to therecovery of Nola. Within the walls of this place, the whole multitudeof the Samnites, and the inhabitants of the country about Nola, betookthemselves on the approach of the dictator. Having taken a view of thesituation of the city, in order that the approach to thefortifications may be the more open, he set fire to all the buildingswhich stood round the walls, which were very numerous; and, in a shorttime after, Nola was taken, either by the dictator Poetelius, or theconsul Caius Junius, for both accounts are given. Those who attributeto the consul the honour of taking Nola, add, that Atina and Calatiawere also taken by him, and that Poetelius was created dictator inconsequence of a pestilence breaking out, merely for the purpose ofdriving the nail. The colonies of Suessa and Pontiae were establishedin this year. Suessa had belonged to the Auruncians: the Volscians hadoccupied Pontiae, an island lying within sight of their shore. Adecree of the senate was also passed for conducting colonies toInteramna and Cassinum. But commissioners were appointed, andcolonists, to the number of four thousand, were sent by the succeedingconsuls, Marcus Valerius and Publius Decius."Book 9,Chapter 29,"The war with the Samnites being now nearly put an end to, beforethe Roman senate was freed from all concern on that side, a reportarose of an Etrurian war; and there was not, in those times, anynation, excepting the Gauls, whose arms were more dreaded, by reasonboth of the vicinity of their country, and of the multitude of theirmen. While therefore one of the consuls prosecuted the remains of thewar in Samnium, Publius Decius, who, being attacked by a severeillness, remained at Rome, by direction of the senate, nominated CaiusJunius Bubulcus dictator. He, as the magnitude of the affair demanded,compelled all the younger citizens to enlist, and with the utmostdiligence prepared arms, and the other matters which the occasionrequired. Yet he was not so elated by the power he had collected, asto think of commencing offensive operations, but prudently determinedto remain quiet, unless the Etrurians should become aggressors. Theplans of the Etrurians were exactly similar with respect to preparingfor, and abstaining from, war: neither party went beyond their ownfrontiers. The censorship of Appius Claudius and Caius Plautius, forthis year, was remarkable; but the name of Appius has been handed downwith more celebrity to posterity, on account of his having made theroad, [called after him, the Appian,] and for having conveyed waterinto the city. These works he performed alone; for his colleague,overwhelmed with shame by reason of the infamous and unworthy choicemade of senators, had abdicated his office. Appius possessing thatinflexibility Of temper, which, from the earliest times, had been thecharacteristic of his family, held on the censorship by himself. Bydirection of the same Appius, the Potitian family, in which the officeof priests attendant on the great altar of Hercules was hereditary,instructed some of the public servants in the rites of that solemnity,with the intention to delegate the same to them. A circumstance isrecorded, wonderful to be told, and one which should make peoplescrupulous of disturbing the established modes of religioussolemnities: for though there were, at that time, twelve branches ofthe Potitian family, all grown-up persons, to the number of thirty,yet they were every one, together with their offspring, cut off withinthe year; so that the name of the Potitii became extinct, while thecensor Appius also was, by the unrelenting wrath of the gods, someyears after, deprived of sight."Book 9,Chapter 30,"The consuls of the succeeding year were, Caius Junius Bubulcus athird time, and Quintus Aemilius Barbula a second. In the commencementof their office, they complained before the people, that, by theimproper choice of members of the senate, that body had beendisgraced, several having been passed over who were preferable to thepersons chosen in; and they declared, that they would pay no regard tosuch election, which had been made without distinction of right orwrong, merely to gratify interest or humour: they then immediatelycalled over the list of the senate, in the same order which hadexisted before the censorship of Appius Claudius and Caius Plautius.Two public employments, both relating to military affairs, came thisyear into the disposal of the people; one being an order, that sixteenof the tribunes, for four legions, should be appointed by the people;whereas hitherto they had been generally in the gift of the dictatorsand consuls, very few of the places being left to suffrage. This orderwas proposed by Lucius Atilius and Caius Marcius, plebeian tribunes.Another was, that the people likewise should constitute two navalcommissioners, for the equipping and refitting of the fleet. Theperson who introduced this order of the people, was Marcus Decius,plebeian tribune. Another transaction of this year I should pass overas trifling, did it not seem to bear some relation to religion. Theflute-players, taking offence because they had been prohibited by thelast censors from holding their repasts in the temple of Jupiter,which had been customary from very early times, went off in a body toTibur; so that there was not one left in the city to play at thesacrifices. The religious tendency of this affair gave uneasiness tothe senate; and they sent envoys to Tibur to endeavour that these menmight be sent back to Rome. The Tiburtines readily promisedcompliance, and first, calling them into the senate-house, warmlyrecommended to them to return to Rome; and then, when they could notbe prevailed on, practised on them an artifice not ill adapted to thedispositions of that description of people: on a festival day, theyinvited them separately to their several houses, apparently with theintention of heightening the pleasure of their feasts with music, andthere plied them with wine, of which such people are always fond,until they laid them asleep. In this state of insensibility they threwthem into waggons, and carried them away to Rome: nor did they knowany thing of the matter, until, the waggons having been left in theforum, the light surprised them, still heavily sick from the debauch.The people then crowded about them, and, on their consenting at lengthto stay, privilege was granted them to ramble about the city in fulldress, with music, and the licence which is now practised every yearduring three days. And that licence, which we see practised atpresent, and the right of being fed in the temple, was restored tothose who played at the sacrifices. These incidents occurred while thepublic attention was deeply engaged by two most important wars."Book 9,Chapter 31,"The consuls adjusting the provinces between them, the Samnitesfell by lot to Junius, the new war of Etruria to Aemilius. In Samniumthe Samnites had blockaded and reduced by famine Cluvia, a Romangarrison, because they had been unable to take it by storm; and, aftertorturing with stripes, in a shocking manner, the townsmen whosurrendered, they had put them to death. Enraged at this cruelty,Junius determined to postpone every thing else to the attacking ofCluvia; and, on the first day that he assaulted the walls, took it bystorm, and slew all who were grown to man's estate. The victorioustroops were led from thence to Bovianum; this was the capital of thePentrian Samnites, by far the most opulent of their cities, and themost powerful both in men and arms. The soldiers, stimulated by thehope of plunder, for their resentment was not so violent, soon madethemselves masters of the town: where there was less severityexercised on the enemy; but a quantity of spoil was carried off,greater almost than had ever been collected out of all Samnium, andthe whole was liberally bestowed on the assailants. And when neitherarmies, camps, or cities could now withstand the vast superiority ofthe Romans in arms; the attention of all the leading men in Samniumbecame intent on this, that an opportunity should be sought for somestratagem, if by any chance the army, proceeding with incautiouseagerness for plunder, could be caught in a snare and overpowered.Peasants who deserted and some prisoners (some thrown in their way byaccident, some purposely) reporting to the consul a statement in whichthey concurred, and one which was at the same time true, that a vastquantity of cattle had been driven together into a defile of difficultaccess, prevailed on them to lead thither the legions lightlyaccoutred for plunder. Here a very numerous army of the enemy hadposted themselves, secretly, at all the passes; and, as soon as theysaw that the Romans had got into the defile, they rose up suddenly,with great clamour and tumult, and attacked them unawares. At first anevent so unexpected caused some confusion, while they were takingtheir arms, and throwing the baggage into the centre; but, as fast aseach had freed himself from his burden and fitted himself with arms,they assembled about the standards, from every side; and all, from thelong course of their service, knowing their particular ranks, the linewas formed of its own accord without any directions. The consul,riding up to the place where the fight was most warm, leaped from hishorse, and called ""Jupiter, Mars, and the other gods to witness, thathe had come into that place, not in pursuit of any glory to himself,but of booty for his soldiers; nor could any other fault be charged onhim, than too great a solicitude to enrich his soldiers at the expenseof the enemy. From that disgrace nothing could extricate him but thevalour of the troops: let them only join unanimously in a vigorousattack against a foe, already vanquished in the field, beaten out oftheir camps, and stripped of their towns, and now trying their lasthope by the contrivance of an ambuscade, placing their reliance on theground they occupied, not on their arms. But what ground was nowunsurmountable to Roman valour?"" The citadel of Fregellae, and that ofSora, were called to their remembrance, with many other places wheredifficulties from situation had been surmounted. Animated by theseexhortations, the soldiers, regardless of all difficulties, advancedagainst the line of the enemy, posted above them; and here there wassome fatigue whilst the army was climbing the steep. But as soon asthe first battalions got footing in the plain, on the summit, and thetroops perceived that they now stood on equal ground, the dismay wasinstantly turned on the plotters; who, dispersing and casting awaytheir arms, attempted, by flight, to recover the same lurking-placesin which they had lately concealed themselves. But the difficulties ofthe ground, which had been intended for the enemy, now entangled themin the snares of their own contrivance. Accordingly very few foundmeans to escape; twenty thousand men were slain, and the victoriousRomans hastened in several parties to secure the booty of cattle,spontaneously thrown in their way by the enemy."Book 9,Chapter 32,"While such was the situation of affairs in Samnium, all the statesof Etruria, except the Arretians, had taken arms, and vigorouslycommenced hostilities, by laying siege to Sutrium; which city, beingin alliance with the Romans, served as a barrier against Etruria.Thither the other consul, Aemilius, came with an army to deliver theallies from the siege. On the arrival of the Romans, the Sutriansconveyed a plentiful supply of provisions into their camp, which waspitched before the city. The Etrurians spent the first day indeliberating whether they should expedite or protract the war. On theday following, when the speedier plan pleased the leaders inpreference to the safer, as soon as the sun rose the for battle wasdisplayed, and the troops marched out to the field; which beingreported to the consul, he instantly commanded notice to be given,that they should dine, and after taking refreshment, then appear underarms. The order was obeyed; and the consul, seeing them armed and inreadiness, ordered the standards to be carried forth beyond therampart, and drew up his men at a small distance from the enemy. Bothparties stood a long time with fixed attention, each waiting for theshout and fight to begin on the opposite side; and the sun had passedthe meridian before a weapon was thrown by either side. Then, ratherthan leave the place without something being done, the shout was givenby the Etrurians, the trumpets sounded, and the battalions advanced.With no less alertness do the Romans commence the fight: both rushedto the fight with violent animosity; the enemy were superior innumbers, the Romans in valour. The battle being doubtful, carries offgreat numbers on both sides, particularly the men of greatest courage;nor did victory declare itself, until the second line of the Romanscame up fresh to the front, in the place of the first, who were muchfatigued. The Etrurians, because their front line was not supported byany fresh reserves, fell all before and round the standards, and in nobattle whatever would there have been seen less disposition to run, ora greater effusion of human blood, had not the night sheltered theEtrurians, who were resolutely determined on death; so that thevictors, not the vanquished, were the first who desisted fromfighting. After sunset the signal for retreat was given, and bothparties retired in the night to their camps. During the remainder ofthe year, nothing memorable was effected at Sutrium; for, of theenemy's army, the whole first line had been cut off in one battle, thereserves only being left, who were scarce sufficient to guard thecamp; and, among the Romans, so numerous were the wounds, that morewounded men died after the battle than had fallen in the field."Book 9,Chapter 33,"Quintus Fabius, consul for the ensuing year, succeeded to thecommand of the army at Sutrium; the colleague given to him was CaiusMarcius Rutilus. On the one side, Fabius brought with him areinforcement from Rome, and on the other, a new army had been sentfor, and came from home, to the Etrurians. Many years had now passedwithout any disputes between the patrician magistrates and plebeiantribunes, when a contest took its rise from that family, which seemedraised by fate as antagonists to the tribunes and commons of thosetimes; Appius Claudius, being censor, when the eighteen months hadexpired, which was the time limited by the Aemilian law for theduration of the censorship, although his colleague Caius Plautius hadalready resigned his office, could not be prevailed on, by any means,to give up his. There was a tribune of the commons, PubliusSempronius; he undertook to enforce a legal process for terminatingthe censorship within the lawful time, which was not more popular thanjust, nor more pleasing to the people generally than to every man ofcharacter in the city. After he frequently appealed to the Aemilianlaw, and bestowed commendations on Mamercus Aemilius, who, in hisdictatorship, had been the author of it, for having contracted, withinthe space of a year and six months, the censorship, which formerly hadlasted five years, and was a power which, in consequence of its longcontinuance, often became tyrannical, he proceeded thus: ""Tell me,Appius Claudius, in what manner you would have acted, had you beencensor, at the time when Caius Furius and Marcus Geganius werecensors?"" Appius insisted, that ""the tribune's question was irrelevantto his case. For, although the Aemilian law might bind those censors,during whose magistracy it was passed,--because the people made thatlaw after they had become censors; and whatever order is the lastpassed by the people, that is held to be the law, and valid:--yetneither he, nor any of those who had been created censors subsequentto the passing of that law, could be bound by it."""Book 9,Chapter 34,"While Appius urged such frivolous arguments as these, whichcarried no conviction whatever, the other said, ""Behold, Romans, theoffspring of that Appius, who being created decemvir for one year,created himself for a second; and who, during a third, without beingcreated even by himself or by any other, held on the fasces and thegovernment though a private individual; nor ceased to continue inoffice, until the government itself, ill acquired, ill administered,and ill retained, overwhelmed him in ruin. This is the same family,Romans, by whose violence and injustice ye were compelled to banishyourselves from your native city, and seize on the Sacred mount; thesame, against which ye provided for yourselves the protection oftribunes; the same, on account of which two armies of you took post onthe Aventine; the same, which violently opposed the laws againstusury, and always the agrarian laws; the same, which broke through theright of intermarriage between the patricians and the commons; thesame, which shut up the road to curule offices against the commons:this is a name, more hostile to your liberty by far, than that of theTarquins. I pray you, Appius Claudius, though this is now thehundredth year since the dictatorship of Mamercus Aemilius, thoughthere have been so many men of the highest characters and abilitiescensors, did none of these ever read the twelve tables? none of themknow, that, whatever was the last order of the people, that was law?Nay, certainly they all knew it; and they therefore obeyed theAemilian law, rather than the old one, under which the censors hadbeen at first created; because it was the last order; and because,when two laws are contradictory, the new always repeals the old. Doyou mean to say, Appius, that the people are not bound by the Aemilianlaw? Or, that the people are bound, and you alone exempted? TheAemilian law bound those violent censors, Caius Furius and MarcusGeganius, who showed what mischief that office might do in the state;when, out of resentment for the limitation of their power, theydisfranchised Mamercus Aemilius, the first man of the age, either inwar or peace. It bound all the censors thenceforward, during the spaceof a hundred years. It binds Caius Plautius your colleague, createdunder the same auspices, with the same privileges. Did not the peoplecreate him with the fullest privileges with which any censor ever wascreated? Or is yours an excepted case, in which this peculiarity andsingularity takes place? Shall the person, whom you create king of thesacrifices, laying hold of the style of sovereignty, say, that he wascreated with the fullest privileges with which any king was evercreated at Rome? Who then, do you think, would be content with adictatorship of six months? who, with the office of interrex for fivedays? Whom would you, with confidence, create dictator, for thepurpose of driving the nail, or of exhibiting games? How foolish, howstupid, do ye think, those must appear in this man's eyes, who, afterperforming most important services, abdicated the dictatorship withinthe twentieth day; or who, being irregularly created, resigned theiroffice? Why should I bring instances from antiquity? Lately, withinthese last ten years, Caius Maenius, dictator, having enforcedinquiries, with more strictness than consisted with the safety of somepowerful men, a charge was thrown out by his enemies, that he himselfwas infected with the very crime against which his inquiries weredirected;--now Maenius, I say, in order that he might, in a privatecapacity, meet the imputation, abdicated the dictatorship. I expectnot such moderation in you; you will not degenerate from your family,of all others the most imperious and assuming; nor resign your officea day, nor even an hour, before you are forced to it. Be it so: butthen let no one exceed the time limited. It is enough to add a day, ora month, to the censorship. But Appius says, I will hold thecensorship, and hold it alone, three years and six months longer thanis allowed by the Aemilian law. Surely this is like kingly power. Orwill you fill up the vacancy with another colleague, a proceeding notallowable, even in the case of the death of a censor? You are notsatisfied that, as if a religious censor, you have degraded a mostancient solemnity, and the only one instituted by the very deity towhom it is performed, from priests of that rite who were of thehighest rank to the ministry of mere servants. [You are not satisfiedthat] a family, more ancient than the origin of this city, andsanctified by an intercourse of hospitality with the immortal gods,has, by means of you and your censorship, been utterly extirpated,with all its branches, within the space of a year, unless you involvethe whole commonwealth in horrid guilt, which my mind feels a horroreven to contemplate. This city was taken in that lustrum in whichLucius Papirius Cursor, on the death of his colleague Julius, thecensor, rather than resign his office, substituted Marcus CorneliusMaluginensis. Yet how much more moderate was his ambition, Appius,than yours! Lucius Papirius neither held the censorship alone, norbeyond the time prescribed by law. But still he found no one who wouldfollow his example; all succeeding censors, in case of the death of acolleague, abdicated the office. As for you, neither the expiration ofthe time of your censorship, nor the resignation of your colleague,nor law, nor shame restrains you. You make fortitude to consist inarrogance, in boldness, in a contempt of gods and men. AppiusClaudius, in consideration of the dignity and respect due to thatoffice which you have borne, I should be sorry, not only to offer youpersonal violence, but even to address you in language too severe.With respect to what I have hitherto said, your pride and obstinacyforced me to speak. And now, unless you pay obedience to the Aemilianlaw, I shall order you to be led to prison. Nor, since a rule has beenestablished by our ancestors, that in the election of censors unlesstwo shall obtain the legal number of suffrages, neither shall bereturned, but the election deferred,--will I suffer you, who could notsingly be created censor, to hold the censorship without a colleague.""Having spoken to this effect he ordered the censor to be seized, andborne to prison. But although six of the tribunes approved of theproceeding of their colleague, three gave their support to Appius, onhis appealing to them, and he held the censorship alone, to the greatdisgust of all ranks of men."Book 9,Chapter 35,"While such was the state of affairs at Rome, the Etrurians hadlaid siege to Sutrium, and the consul Fabius, as he was marching alongthe foot of the mountains, with a design to succour the allies, andattempt the enemy's works, if it were by any means practicable, wasmet by their army prepared for battle. As the wide-extended plainbelow showed the greatness of their force, the consul, in order toremedy his deficiency in point of number, by advantage of the ground,changed the direction of his route a little towards the hills, wherethe way was rugged and covered with stones, and then formed histroops, facing the enemy. The Etrurians, thinking of nothing but theirnumbers, on which alone they depended, commence the fight with suchhaste and eagerness, that, in order to come the sooner to a closeengagement, they threw away their javelins, drew their swords, rushingagainst the enemy. On the other side, the Romans poured down on them,sometimes javelins, and sometimes stones which the place abundantlysupplied; so that whilst the blows on their shields and helmetsconfused even those whom they did not wound, (it was neither an easymatter to come to close quarters, nor had they missive weapons withwhich to fight at a distance,) when there was nothing now to protectthem whilst standing and exposed to the blows, some even giving way,and the whole line wavering and unsteady the spearmen and the firstrank, renewing the shout, rush on them with drawn swords. This attackthe Etrurians could not withstand, but, facing about, fledprecipitately towards their camp; when the Roman cavalry, gettingbefore them by galloping obliquely across the plain, threw themselvesin the way of their flight, on which they quitted the road, and benttheir course to the mountains. From thence, in a body, almost withoutarms, and debilitated with wounds, they made their way into theCiminian forest. The Romans, having slain in many thousands of theEtrurians, and taken thirty-eight military standards, took alsopossession of their camp, together with a vast quantity of spoil. Theythen began to consider of pursuing the enemy."Book 9,Chapter 36,"The Ciminian forest was in those days deemed as impassable andfrightful as the German forests have been in latter times; not evenany trader having ever attempted to pass it. Hardly any, besides thegeneral himself, showed boldness enough to enter it; the others hadnot the remembrance of the disaster at Caudium effaced from theirmind. On this, of those who were present, Marcus Fabius, the consul'sbrother, (some say Caeso, others Caius Claudius, born of the samemother with the consul,) undertook to go and explore the country, andto bring them in a short time an account of every particular. Beingeducated at Caere, where he had friends, he was perfectly acquaintedwith the Etrurian language. I have seen it affirmed, that, in thosetimes, the Roman youth were commonly instructed in the Etrurianlearning, as they are now in the Greek: but it is more probable, thatthere was something very extraordinary in the person who acted sodaringly a counterfeit part, and mixed among the enemy. It is said,that his only attendant was a slave, who had been bred up with him,and who was therefore not ignorant of the same language. They receivedno further instructions at their departure, than a summary descriptionof the country through which they were to pass; to this was added thenames of the principal men in the several states, to prevent theirbeing at a loss in conversation, and from being discovered by makingsome mistake. They set out in the dress of shepherds, armed withrustic weapons, bills, and two short javelins each. But neither theirspeaking the language of the country, nor the fashion of their dressand arms, concealed them so effectually, as the incrediblecircumstance of a stranger's passing the Ciminian forest. They aresaid to have penetrated as far as the Camertian district of theUmbrians: there the Romans ventured to own who they were, and beingintroduced to the senate, treated with them, in the name of theconsul, about an alliance and friendship; and after being entertainedwith courteous hospitality, were desired to acquaint the Romans, thatif they came into those countries, there should be provisions inreadiness for the troops sufficient for thirty days, and that theyshould find the youth of the Camertian Umbrians prepared in arms toobey their commands. When this information was brought to the consul,he sent forward the baggage at the first watch, ordering the legionsto march in the rear of it. He himself staid behind with the cavalry,and the next day, as soon as light appeared, rode up to the posts ofthe enemy, which had been stationed on the outside of the forest; and,when he had detained them there for a sufficient length of time, heretired to his camp, and marching out by the opposite gate, overtookthe main body of the army before night. At the first light, on thefollowing day, he had gained the summit of Mount Ciminius, from whencehaving a view of the opulent plains of Etruria, he let loose hissoldiers upon them. When a vast booty had been driven off, sometumultuary cohorts of Etrurian peasants, hastily collected by theprincipal inhabitants of the district, met the Romans; but in suchdisorderly array, that these rescuers of the prey were near becomingwholly a prey themselves. These being slain or put to flight, and thecountry laid waste to a great extent, the Romans returned to theircamp victorious, and enriched with plenty of every kind. It happenedthat, in the mean time, five deputies, with two plebeian tribunes, hadcome hither, to charge Fabius, in the name of the senate, not toattempt to pass the Ciminian forest. These, rejoicing that they hadarrived too late to prevent the expedition, returned to Rome with thenews of its success."Book 9,Chapter 37,"By this expedition of the consul, the war, instead of beingbrought nearer to a conclusion, was only spread to a wider extent: forall the tract adjacent to the foot of Mount Ciminius had felt hisdevastations; and, out of the indignation conceived thereat, hadroused to arms, not only the states of Etruria, but the neighbouringparts of Umbria. They came therefore to Sutrium, with such a numerousarmy as they had never before brought into the field; and not onlyventured to encamp on the outside of the wood, but through theirearnest desire of coming to an engagement as soon as possible, marcheddown the plains to offer battle. The troops, being marshalled, stoodat first, for some time, on their own ground, having left a spacesufficient for the Romans to draw up, opposite to them; but perceivingthat the enemy declined fighting, they advanced to the rampart; where,when they observed that even the advanced guards had retired withinthe works, a shout at once was raised around their generals, that theyshould order provisions for that day to be brought down to them: ""forthey were resolved to remain there under arms; and either in thenight, or, at all events, at the dawn of day, to attack the enemy'scamp."" The Roman troops, though not less eager for action, wererestrained by the commands of the general. About the tenth hour, theconsul ordered his men a repast; and gave directions that they shouldbe ready in arms, at whatever time of the day or night he should givethe signal. He then addressed a few words to them; spoke in high termsof the wars of the Samnites, and disparagingly of the Etrurians, who""were not,"" he said, ""as an enemy to be compared with other enemies,nor as a numerous force, with others in point of numbers. Besides, hehad an engine at work, as they should find in due time; at present itwas of importance to keep it secret."" By these hints he intimated thatthe enemy was circumvented in order to raise the courage of his men,damped by the superiority of the enemy's force; and, from their nothaving fortified the post where they lay, the insinuation of astratagem formed against them seemed the more credible. Afterrefreshing themselves, they consigned themselves to rest, and beingroused without noise, about the fourth watch, took arms. Axes aredistributed among the servants following the army, to tear down therampart and fill up the trench. The line was formed within the works,and some chosen cohorts posted close to the gates. Then, a littlebefore day, which in summer nights is the time of the profoundestsleep, the signal being given, the rampart was levelled, and thetroops rushing forth, fell upon the enemy, who were every wherestretched at their length. Some were put to death before they couldstir; others half asleep, in their beds; the greatest part, while theyran in confusion to arms; few, in short, had time afforded them to armthemselves; and these, who followed no particular leader, nor orders,were quickly routed by the Romans and pursued by the Roman horse. Theyfled different ways; to the camp and to the woods. The latter affordedthe safer refuge; for the former, being situated in a plain, was takenthe same day. The gold and silver was ordered to be brought to theconsul; the rest of the spoil was given to the soldiers. On that day,sixty thousand of the enemy were slain or taken. Some affirm, thatthis famous battle was fought on the farther side of the Ciminianforest, at Perusia; and that the public had been under great dread,lest the army might be enclosed in such a dangerous pass, andoverpowered by a general combination of the Etrurians and Umbrians.But on whatever spot it was fought, it is certain that the Roman powerprevailed; and, in consequence thereof, ambassadors from Perusia,Cortona, and Arretium, which were then among the principal states ofEtruria, soliciting a peace and alliance with the Romans, obtained atruce for thirty years."Book 9,Chapter 38,"During these transactions in Etruria, the other consul, CaiusMarcius Rutilus, took Allifae by storm from the Samnites; and many oftheir forts, and smaller towns, were either destroyed by his arms, orsurrendered without being injured. About the same time also, the Romanfleet, having sailed to Campania, under Publius Cornelius, to whom thesenate had given the command on the sea-coast, put into Pompeii.Immediately on landing, the soldiers of the fleet set out to ravagethe country about Nuceria: and after they had quickly laid waste theparts which lay nearest, and whence they could have returned to theships with safety, they were allured by the temptation of plunder, asit often happens, to advance too far, and thereby roused the enemyagainst them. While they rambled about the country, they met noopposition, though they might have been cut off to a man; but as theywere returning, in a careless manner, the peasants overtook them, notfar from the ships, stripped them of the booty, and even slew a greatpart of them. Those who escaped were driven in confusion to the ships.As Fabius' having marched through the Ciminian forest had occasionedviolent apprehensions at Rome, so it had excited joy in proportionamong the enemy in Samnium: they talked of the Roman army being pentup, and surrounded; and of the Caudine forks, as a model of theirdefeat. ""Those people,"" they said, ""ever greedy after furtheracquisitions, were now brought into inextricable difficulties, hemmedin, not more effectually by the arms of their enemy, than by thedisadvantage of the ground."" Their joy was even mingled with a degreeof envy, because fortune, as they thought, had transferred the gloryof finishing the Roman war, from the Samnites to the Etrurians: theyhastened, therefore, with their whole collected force, to crush theconsul Caius Marcius; resolving, if he did not give them anopportunity of fighting, to proceed, through the territories of theMarsians and Sabines, into Etruria. The consul met them, and a battlewas fought with great fury on both sides, but without a decisiveissue. Although both parties suffered severely, yet the discredit ofdefeat fell on the Romans, because several of equestrian rank, somemilitary tribunes, with one lieutenant-general, had fallen; and, whatwas more remarkable than all, the consul himself was wounded. Onaccount of this event, exaggerated by report as is usual, the senatebecame greatly alarmed, so that they resolved on having a dictatornominated. No one entertained a doubt that the nomination would lighton Papirius Cursor, who was then universally deemed to possess thegreatest abilities as a commander: but they could not be certain,either that a message might be conveyed with safety into Samnium,where all was in a state of hostility, or that the consul Marcius wasalive. The other consul, Fabius, was at enmity with Papirius, on hisown account; and lest this resentment might prove an obstacle to thepublic good, the senate voted that deputies of consular rank should besent to him, who, uniting their own influence to that of government,might prevail on him to drop, for the sake of his country, allremembrance of private animosities. When the deputies, having come toFabius, delivered to him the decree of the senate, adding sucharguments as were suitable to their instructions, the consul, castinghis eyes towards the ground, retired in silence, leaving them inuncertainty what part he intended to act. Then, in the silent time ofthe night, according to the established custom, he nominated LuciusPapirius dictator. When the deputies returned him thanks, for so verymeritoriously subduing his passion, he still persevered in obstinatesilence, and dismissed them without any answer, or mention of what hehad done: a proof that he felt an extraordinary degree of resentment,which had been suppressed within his breast. Papirius appointed CaiusJunius Bubulcus master of the horse; and, as he was proceeding in anassembly of the Curiae [Footnote: The _comitia curiata_, orassemblies of the curiae, alone had the power of conferring militarycommand; no magistrate, therefore, could assume the command withoutthe previous order of their assembly. In time, this came to be a merematter of form; yet the practice always continued to be observed.] toget an order passed respecting the command of the army, an unluckyomen obliged him to adjourn it; for the Curia which was to vote first,happened to be the Faucian, remarkably distinguished by two disasters,the taking of the city, and the Caudine peace; the same Curia havingvoted first in those years in which the said events are found.Licinius Macer supposes this Curia ominous, also, on account of athird misfortune, that which was experienced at the Cremera."Book 9,Chapter 39,"Next day the dictator, taking the auspices anew, obtained theorder, and, marching out at the head of the legions, lately raised onthe alarm occasioned by the army passing the Ciminian forest, came toLongula; where having received the old troops of the consul Marcius,he led on his forces to battle; nor did the enemy seem to decline thecombat. However, they stood drawn up for battle and under arms, untilnight came on; neither side choosing to begin the fray. After this,they continued a considerable time encamped near each other, withoutcoming to action; neither diffident of their own strength, nordespising the adversary. Meanwhile matters went on actively inEtruria; for a decisive battle was fought with the Umbrians, in whichthe enemy was routed, but lost not many men, for they did not maintainthe fight with the vigour with which they began it. Besides this theEtrurians, having raised an army under the sanctions of the devotinglaw, each man choosing another, came to an engagement at the Cape ofVadimon, with more numerous forces, and, at the same time, withgreater spirit than they had ever shown before. The battle was foughtwith such animosity that no javelins were thrown by either party:swords alone were made use of; and the fury of the combatants wasstill higher inflamed by the long-continued contest; so that itappeared to the Romans as if they were disputing, not with Etrurians,whom they had so often conquered, but with a new race. Not thesemblance of giving ground appeared in any part; the first lines fell;and lest the standards should be exposed, without defence, the secondlines were formed in their place. At length, even the men forming thelast reserves were called into action; and to such an extremity ofdifficulty and danger had they come, that the Roman cavalrydismounted, and pressed forward, through heaps of arms and bodies, tothe front ranks of the infantry. These starting up a new army, as itwere, among men now exhausted, disordered the battalions of theEtrurians; and the rest, weak as their condition was, seconding theirassault, broke at last through the enemy's ranks. Their obstinacy thenbegan to give way: some companies quitted their posts, and, as soon asthey once turned their backs, betook themselves to more decidedflight. That day first broke the strength of the Etrurians, now grownexuberant through a long course of prosperity; all the flower of theirmen were cut off in the field, and in the same assault their camp wasseized and sacked."Book 9,Chapter 40,"Equal danger, and an issue equally glorious, soon after attendedthe war with the Samnites; who, besides their many preparations forthe field, made their army to glitter with new decorations of theirarmour. Their troops were in two divisions, one of which had theirshields embossed with gold, the other with silver. The shape of theshield was this; broad at the middle to cover the breast andshoulders, the summit being flat, sloping off gradually so as tobecome pointed below, that it might be wielded with ease; a loose coatof mail also served as a protection for the breast, and the left legwas covered with a greave; their helmets were adorned with plumes, toadd to the appearance of their stature. The golden-armed soldiers woretunics of various colours; the silver-armed, of white linen. To thelatter the right wing was assigned; the former took post on the left.The Romans had been apprized of these splendid accoutrements, and hadbeen taught by their commanders, that ""a soldier ought to be rough;not decorated with gold and silver, but placing his confidence in hissword. That matters of this kind were in reality spoil rather thanarmour; glittering before action, but soon becoming disfigured amidblood and wounds. That the brightest ornament of a soldier was valour;that all those trinkets would follow victory, and that those richenemies would be valuable prizes to the conquerors, however poor.""Cursor, having animated his men with these observations, led them onto battle. He took post himself on the right wing, he gave the commandof the left to the master of the horse. As soon as they engaged, thestruggle between the two armies became desperate, while it was no lessso between the dictator and the master of the horse, on which wingvictory should first show itself. It happened that Junius first, withthe left wing, made the right of the enemy give way; this consisted ofmen devoted after the custom of Samnites, and on that accountdistinguished by white garments and armour of equal whiteness. Junius,saying ""he would sacrifice these to Pluto,"" pressed forward,disordered their ranks, and made an evident impression on their line:which being perceived by the dictator, he exclaimed, ""Shall thevictory begin on the left wing, and shall the right, the dictator'sown troops, only second the arms of others, and not claim the greatestshare of the victory?"" This spurred on the soldiers: nor did thecavalry yield to the infantry in bravery, nor the ardour oflieutenants-general to that of the commanders. Marcius Valerius fromthe right wing, and Publius Decius from the left, both men of consularrank, rode off to the cavalry, posted on the extremities of the line,and, exhorting them to join in putting in for a share of the honour,charged the enemy on the flanks. When the addition of this new alarmassailed the enemies' troops on both sides, and the Roman legions,having renewed the shout to confound the enemy, rushed on, they beganto fly. And now the plains were quickly filled with heaps of bodiesand splendid armour. At first, their camp received the dismayedSamnites; but they did not long retain even the possession of that:before night it was taken, plundered, and burnt. The dictatortriumphed, in pursuance of a decree of the senate; and the mostsplendid spectacle by far, of any in his procession, was the capturedarms: so magnificent were they deemed, that the shields, adorned withgold, were distributed among the owners of the silver shops, to serveas embellishments to the forum. Hence, it is said, arose the custom ofthe forum being decorated by the aediles, when the grand processionsare made on occasion of the great games. The Romans, indeed, convertedthese extraordinary arms to the honour of the gods: but theCampanians, out of pride, and in hatred of the Samnites, gave them asornaments to their gladiators, who used to be exhibited as a show attheir feasts, and whom they distinguished by the name of Samnites.During this year, the consul Fabius fought with the remnants of theEtrurians at Perusia, which city also had violated the truce, andgained an easy and decisive victory. He would have taken the townitself (for he marched up to the walls,) had not deputies come out andcapitulated. Having placed a garrison at Perusia, and sent on beforehim to the Roman senate the embassies of Etruria, who solicitedfriendship, the consul rode into the city in triumph, for successesmore important than those of the dictator. Besides, a great share ofthe honour of reducing the Samnites was attributed to thelieutenants-general, Publius Decius and Marcius Valerius: whom, at thenext election, the people, with universal consent, declared the oneconsul, the other praetor."Book 9,Chapter 41,"To Fabius, in consideration of his extraordinary merit in theconquest of Etruria, the consulship was continued. Decius wasappointed his colleague. Valerius was created praetor a fourth time.The consuls divided the provinces between them. Etruria fell toDecius, Samnium to Fabius. The latter, having marched to Nuceria,rejected the application of the people of Alfaterna, who then sued forpeace, because they had not accepted it when offered, and by force ofarms compelled them to surrender. A battle was fought with theSamnites; the enemy were overcome without much difficulty: nor wouldthe memory of that engagement have been preserved, except that in itthe Marsians first appeared in arms against the Romans. ThePelignians, imitating the defection of the Marsians, met the samefate. The other consul, Decius, was likewise very successful in hisoperations: through terror he compelled the Tarquinians to supply hisarmy with corn, and to sue for a truce for forty years. He tookseveral forts from the Volsinians by assault, some of which hedemolished, that they might not serve as receptacles to the enemy, andby extending his operations through every quarter, diffused such adread of his arms, that the whole Etrurian nation sued to the consulfor an alliance: this they did not obtain; but a truce for a year wasgranted them. The pay of the Roman army for that year was furnished bythe enemy; and two tunics for each soldier were exacted from them:this was the purchase of the truce. The tranquillity now establishedin Etruria was interrupted by a sudden insurrection of the Umbrians, anation which had suffered no injury from the war, except whatinconvenience the country had felt in the passing of the army. These,by calling into the field all their own young men, and forcing a greatpart of the Etrurians to resume their arms, made up such a numerousforce, that speaking of themselves with ostentatious vanity and of theRomans with contempt, they boasted that they would leave Decius behindin Etruria, and march away to besiege Rome; which design of theirsbeing reported to the consul Decius, he removed by long marches fromEtruria towards their city, and sat down in the district of Pupinia,in readiness to act according to the intelligence received of theenemy. Nor was the insurrection of the Umbrians slighted at Rome:their very threats excited tears among the people, who hadexperienced, in the calamities suffered from the Gauls, how insecure acity they inhabited. Deputies were therefore despatched to the consulFabius with directions, that, if he had any respite from the war ofthe Samnites, he should with all haste lead his army into Umbria. Theconsul obeyed the order, and by forced marches proceeded to Mevania,where the forces of the Umbrians then lay. The unexpected arrival ofthe consul, whom they had believed to be sufficiently employed inSamnium, far distant from their country, so thoroughly affrighted theUmbrians, that several advised retiring to their fortified towns;others, the discontinuing the war. However, one district, called bythemselves Materina, prevailed on the rest not only to retain theirarms, but to come to an immediate engagement. They fell upon Fabiuswhile he was fortifying his camp. When the consul saw them rushingimpetuously towards his rampart, he called off his men from the work,and drew them up in the best manner which the nature of the place andthe time allowed; encouraging them by displaying, in honourable andjust terms, the glory which they had acquired, as well in Etruria asin Samnium, he bade them finish this insignificant appendage to theEtrurian war, and take vengeance for the impious expressions in whichthese people had threatened to attack the city of Rome. Such was thealacrity of the soldiers on hearing this, that, raising the shoutspontaneously, they interrupted the general's discourse, and, withoutwaiting for orders, advanced, with the sound of all the trumpets andcornets, in full speed against the enemy. They made their attack notas on men, or at least men in arms, but, what must appear wonderful inthe relation, began by snatching the standards out of the hands whichheld them; and then, the standard-bearers themselves were dragged tothe consul, and the armed soldiers transferred from the one line tothe other; and wherever resistance was any where made, the businesswas performed, not so much with swords, as with their shields, withthe bosses of which, and thrusts of their elbows, they bore down thefoe. The prisoners were more numerous than the slain, and through thewhole line the Umbrians called on each other, with one voice, to laydown their arms. Thus a surrender was made in the midst of action, bythe first promoters of the war; and on the next and following days,the other states of the Umbrians also surrendered. The Ocriculans wereadmitted to a treaty of friendship on giving security."Book 9,Chapter 42,"Fabius, successful in a war allotted to another, led back his armyinto his own province. And as, in the preceding year, the people had,in consideration of his services so successfully performed, re-electedhim to the consulship, so now the senate, from the same motive,notwithstanding a warm opposition made by Appius, prolonged hiscommand for the year following, in which Appius Claudius and LuciusVolumnius were consuls. In some annals I find, that Appius, stillholding the office of censor, declared himself a candidate for theconsulship, and that his election was stopped by a protest of LuciusFurius, plebeian tribune, until he resigned the censorship. After hiselection to the consulship, the new war with the Sallentine enemiesbeing decreed to his colleague, he remained at Rome, with design toincrease his interest by city intrigues, since the means of procuringhonour in war were placed in the hands of others. Volumnius had noreason to be dissatisfied with his province: he fought many battleswith good success, and took several cities by assault. He was liberalin his donations of the spoil; and this munificence, engaging initself, he enhanced by his courteous demeanour, by which conduct heinspired his soldiers with ardour to meet both toil and danger.Quintus Fabius, proconsul, fought a pitched battle with the armies ofthe Samnites, near the city of Allifae. The victory was complete. Theenemy were driven from the field, and pursued to their camp; nor wouldthey have kept possession of that, had not the day been almost spent.It was invested, however, before night, and guarded until day, lestany should slip away. Next morning, while it was scarcely clear day,they proposed to capitulate, and it was agreed, that such as werenatives of Samnium should be dismissed with single garments. All thesewere sent under the yoke. No precaution was taken in favour of theallies of the Samnites: they were sold by auction, to the number ofseven thousand. Those who declared themselves subjects of theHernicians, were kept by themselves under a guard. All these Fabiussent to Rome to the senate; and, after being examined, whether it wasin consequence of a public order, or as volunteers, that they hadcarried arms on the side of the Samnites against the Romans, they weredistributed among the states of the Latins to be held in custody; andit was ordered, that the new consuls, Publius Cornelius Arvina andQuintus Marcius Tremulus, who by this time had been elected, shouldlay that affair entire before the senate: this gave such offence tothe Hernicians, that, at a meeting of all the states, assembled by theAnagnians, in the circus called the Maritime, the whole nation of theHernicians, excepting the Alatrians, Ferentines, and Verulans,declared war against the Roman people."Book 9,Chapter 43,"In Samnium also, in consequence of the departure of Fabius, newcommotions arose. Calatia and Sora, and the Roman garrisons stationedthere, were taken, and extreme cruelty was exercised towards thecaptive soldiers: Publius Cornelius was therefore sent thither with anarmy. The command against the new enemy (for by this time an order hadpassed for declaring war against the Anagnians, and the rest of theHernicians) was decreed to Marcius. These, in the beginning, securedall the passes between the camps of the consuls, in such a manner,that no messenger, however expert, could make his way from one to theother; and each consul spent several days in absolute uncertaintyregarding every matter and in anxious suspense concerning the state ofthe other. Apprehensions for their safety spread even to Rome; so thatall the younger citizens were compelled to enlist and two regulararmies were raised, to answer sudden emergencies. The conduct of theHernicians during the progress of the war afterwards, showed nothingsuitable to the present alarm, or to the ancient renown of thatnation. Without ever venturing any effort worth mentioning, beingstripped of three different camps within a few days, they stipulatedfor a truce of thirty days, during which they might send to Rome, tothe senate, on the terms of furnishing two months' pay, and corn, anda tunic to every soldier. They were referred back to Marcius by thesenate, whom by a decree they empowered to determine regarding theHernicians, and he accepted their submission. Meanwhile, in Samnium,the other consul, though superior in strength, was very muchembarrassed by the nature of his situation; the enemy had blocked upall the roads, and seized on the passable defiles, so that noprovisions could be conveyed; nor could the consul, though he dailydrew out his troops and offered battle, allure them to an engagement.It was evident, that neither could the Samnites support an immediatecontest, nor the Romans a delay of action. The approach of Marcius,who, after he had subdued the Hernicians, hastened to the succour ofhis colleague, put it out of the enemy's power any longer to avoidfighting: for they, who had not deemed themselves a match in thefield, even for one of the armies, could not surely suppose that ifthey should allow the two consular armies to unite, they could haveany hope remaining: they made an attack therefore on Marcius, as hewas approaching in the irregular order of march. The baggage washastily thrown together in the centre, and the line formed as well asthe time permitted. First the shout which reached the standing camp ofCornelius, then the dust observed at a distance, excited a bustle inthe camp of the other consul. Ordering his men instantly to take arms,and leading them out to the field with the utmost haste, he chargedthe flank of the enemy's line, which had enough to do in the otherdispute, at the same time exclaiming, that ""it would be the height ofinfamy if they suffered Marcius's army to monopolize the honour ofboth victories, and did not assert their claim to the glory of theirown war."" He bore down all before him, and pushed forward, through themidst of the enemy's line, to their camp, which, being left without aguard, he took and set on fire; which when the soldiers of Marcius sawin flames, and the enemy observed it on looking about, a generalflight immediately took place among the Samnites. But they could noteffect an escape in any direction; in every quarter they met death.After a slaughter of thirty thousand men, the consuls had now giventhe signal for retreat; and were collecting, into one body, theirseveral forces, who were employed in mutual congratulations, when somenew cohorts of the enemy, which had been levied for a reinforcement,being seen at a distance, occasioned a renewal of the carnage. Onthese the conquerors rushed, without any order of the consuls, orsignal received, crying out, that they would make these Samnites paydearly for their introduction to service. The consuls indulged theardour of the legions, well knowing that the raw troops of the enemy,mixed with veterans dispirited by defeat, would be incapable even ofattempting a contest. Nor were they wrong in their judgment: all theforces of the Samnites, old and new, fled to the nearest mountains.These the Roman army also ascended, so that no situation affordedsafety to the vanquished; they were beaten off, even from the summitswhich they had seized. And now they all, with on voice, supplicatedfor a suspension of arms. On which, being ordered to furnish corn forthree months, pay for a year, and a tunic to each of the soldiers,they sent deputies to the senate to sue for peace. Cornelius was leftin Samnium. Marcius returned into the city, in triumph over theHernicians; and a decree was passed for erecting to him, in the forum,an equestrian statue, which was placed before the temple of Castor. Tothree states of the Hernicians, (the Alatrians, Verulans, andFerentines,) their own laws were restored, because they preferredthese to the being made citizens of Rome; and they were permitted tointermarry with each other, a privilege which they alone of theHernicians, for a long time after, enjoyed. To the Anagnians, and theothers, who had made war on the Romans, was granted the freedom of thestate, without the right of voting; public assemblies, andintermarriages, were not allowed them, and their magistrates wereprohibited from acting except in the ministration of public worship.During this year, Caius Junius Bubulcus, censor, contracted for thebuilding of a temple to Health, which he had vowed during hisconsulate in the war with the Samnites. By the same person, and hiscolleague, Marcus Valerius Maximus, roads were made through the fieldsat the public expense. During the same year the treaty with theCarthaginians was renewed a third time, and ample presents made totheir ambassadors who came on that business."Book 9,Chapter 44,"This year had a dictator in office, Publius Cornelius Scipio, withPublius Decius Mus, master of the horse. By these the election ofconsuls was held, being the purpose for which they had been created,because neither of the consuls could be absent from the armies. Theconsuls elected were Lucius Postumius and Titus Minucius; whom Pisoplaces next after Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius, omitting the twoyears in which I have set down Claudius with Volumnius, and Corneliuswith Marcius, as consuls. Whether this happened through a lapse ofmemory in digesting his annals, or whether he purposely passed overthose two consulates as deeming the accounts of them false, cannot beascertained. During this year the Samnites made incursions into thedistrict of Stellae in the Campanian territory. Both the consuls weretherefore sent into Samnium, and proceeded to different regions,Postumius to Tifernum, Minucius to Bovianum. The first engagementhappened at Tifernum, under the command of Postumius. Some say, thatthe Samnites were completely defeated, and twenty thousand of themmade prisoners. Others, that the army separated without victory oneither side; and that Postumius, counterfeiting fear, withdrew hisforces privately by night, and marched away to the mountains; whitherthe enemy also followed, and took possession of a stronghold two milesdistant. The consul, having created a belief that he had come thitherfor the sake of a safe post, and a fruitful spot, (and such it reallywas,) secured his camp with strong works. Furnishing it with magazinesof every thing useful, he left a strong guard to defend it; and at thethird watch, led away the legions lightly accoutred, by the shortestroad which he could take, to join his colleague, who lay opposite tohis foe. There, by advice of Postumius, Minucius came to an engagementwith the enemy; and when the fight had continued doubtful through agreat part of the day, Postumius, with his fresh legions, made anunexpected attack on the enemy's line, spent by this time withfatigue: thus, weariness and wounds having rendered them incapableeven of flying, they were cut off to a man, and twenty-one standardstaken. The Romans then proceeded to Postumius's station, where the twovictorious armies falling upon the enemy, already dismayed by the newsof what had passed, routed and dispersed them: twenty-six militarystandards were taken here, and the Samnite general, Statius Gellius,with a great number of other prisoners, and both the camps were taken.Next day Bovianum was besieged, and soon after taken. Both the consulswere honoured with a triumph, with high applause of their excellentconduct. Some writers say, that the consul Minucius was brought backto the camp grievously wounded, and that he died there; that MarcusFulvius was substituted consul in his place, and that it was he who,being sent to command Minucius's army, took Bovianum. During the sameyear, Sora, Arpinum, and Censennia were recovered from the Samnites.The great statue of Hercules was erected in the Capitol, anddedicated."Book 9,Chapter 45,"In the succeeding consulate of Publius Sulpicius Saverrio andPublius Sempronius Sophus, the Samnites, desirous either of atermination or a suspension of hostilities, sent ambassadors to Rometo treat of peace; to whose submissive solicitations this answer wasreturned, that, ""had not the Samnites frequently solicited peace, attimes when they were actually preparing for war, their presentapplication might, perhaps, in the course of negotiating, haveproduced the desired effect. But now, since words had hitherto provedvain, people's conduct must be guided by facts: that PubliusSempronius the consul would shortly be in Samnium with an army: thathe could not be deceived in judging whether their dispositionsinclined to peace or war. He would bring the senate certaininformation respecting every particular, and their ambassadors mightfollow the consul on his return from Samnium."" When the Roman armyaccordingly marched through all parts of Samnium, which was in a stateof peace, provisions being liberally supplied, a renewal of the oldtreaty was, this year, granted to the Samnites. The Roman arms werethen turned against the Aequans, their old enemies, but who had, formany years past, remained quiet, under the guise of a treacherouspeace, because, while the Hernicians were in a state of prosperity,these had, in conjunction with them, frequently sent aid to theSamnites; and after the Hernicians were subdued, almost the wholenation, without dissembling that they acted by public authority, hadrevolted to the enemy; and when, after the conclusion of the treatywith the Samnites at Rome, ambassadors were sent to demandsatisfaction, they said, that ""this was only a trial made of them, onthe expectation that they would through fear suffer themselves to bemade Roman citizens. But how much that condition was to be wished for,they had been taught by the Hernicians; who, when they had the option,preferred their own laws to the freedom of the Roman state. To peoplewho wished for liberty to choose what they judged preferable, thenecessity of becoming Roman citizens would have the nature of apunishment."" In resentment of these declarations, uttered publicly intheir assemblies, the Roman people ordered war to be made on theAequans; and, in prosecution of this new undertaking, both the consulsmarched from the city, and sat down at the distance of four miles fromthe camp of the enemy. The troops of the Aequans, like tumultuaryrecruits, in consequence of their having passed such a number of yearswithout waging war on their own account, were all in disorder andconfusion, without established officers and without command. Someadvised to give battle, others to defend the camp; the greater partwere influenced by concern for the devastation of their lands, likelyto take place, and the consequent destruction of their cities, leftwith weak garrisons. Among a variety of propositions, one, however,was heard which, abandoning all concern for the public interest,tended to transfer every man's attention to the care of his privateconcerns. It recommended that, at the first watch, they should departfrom the camp by different roads, so as to carry all their effectsinto the cities, and to secure them by the strength of thefortifications; this they all approved with universal assent. When theenemy were now dispersed through the country, the Romans, at the firstdawn, marched out to the field, and drew up in order of battle; but noone coming to oppose them, they advanced in a brisk pace to theenemy's camp. But when they perceived neither guards before the gates,nor soldiers on the ramparts, nor the usual bustle of acamp,--surprised at the extraordinary silence, they halted inapprehension of some stratagem. At length, passing over the rampart,and finding the whole deserted, they proceeded to search out thetracks of the enemy. But these, as they scattered themselves to everyquarter, occasioned perplexity at first. Afterwards discovering theirdesign by means of scouts, they attacked their cities, one afteranother, and within the space of fifty days took, entirely by force,forty-one towns, most of which were razed and burnt, and the race ofthe Aequans almost extirpated. A triumph was granted over the Aequans.The Marrucinians, Marsians, Pelignians, and Ferentans, warned by theexample of their disasters, sent deputies to Rome to solicit peace andfriendship; and these states, on their submissive applications, wereadmitted into alliance."Book 9,Chapter 46,"In the same year, Cneius Flavius, son of Cneius, grandson of afreed man, a notary, in low circumstances originally, but artful andeloquent, was appointed curule aedile. I find in some annals, that,being in attendance on the aediles, and seeing that he was votedaedile by the prerogative tribe, but that his name would not bereceived, because he acted as a notary, he threw down his tablet, andtook an oath, that he would not, for the future, follow that business.But Licinius Macer contends, that he had dropped the employment ofnotary a considerable time before, having already been a tribune, andtwice a triumvir, once for regulating the nightly watch, and anothertime for conducting a colony. However, of this there is no dispute,that against the nobles, who threw contempt on the meanness of hiscondition, he contended with much firmness. He made public the rulesof proceeding in judicial causes, hitherto shut up in the closets ofthe pontiffs; and hung up to public view, round the forum, thecalendar on white tablets, that all might know when business could betransacted in the courts. To the great displeasure of the nobles, heperformed the dedication of the temple of Concord, in the area ofVulcan's temple; and the chief pontiff, Cornelius Barbatus, wascompelled by the united instances of the people, to dictate to him theform of words, although he affirmed, that, consistently with thepractice of antiquity, no other than a consul, or commander-in-chief,could dedicate a temple. This occasioned a law to be proposed to thepeople, by direction of the senate, that no person should dedicate atemple, or an altar, without an order from the senate, or from amajority of the plebeian tribunes. The incident which I am about tomention would be trivial in itself, were it not an instance of thefreedom assumed by plebeians in opposition to the pride of the nobles.When Flavius had come to make a visit to his colleague, who was sick,and when, by an arrangement between some young nobles who were sittingthere, they did not rise on his entrance, he ordered his curule chairto be brought thither, and from his honourable seat of office enjoyedthe sight of his enemies tortured with envy. However, a low faction,which had gathered strength during the censorship of Appius Claudius,had made Flavius an aedile; for he was the first who degraded thesenate, by electing into it the immediate descendants of freed men;and when no one allowed that election as valid, and when he had notacquired in the senate-house that influence in the city which he hadbeen aiming at, by distributing men of the meanest order among all theseveral tribes, he thus corrupted the assemblies both of the forum andof the field of Mars; and so much indignation did the election ofFlavius excite, that most of the nobles laid aside their gold ringsand bracelets in consequence of it. From that time the state was splitinto two parties. The uncorrupted part of the people, who favoured andsupported the good, held one side; the faction of the rabble, theother; until Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius were made censors; andFabius, both for the sake of concord, and at the same time to preventthe elections remaining in the hands of the lowest of the people,purged the rest of the tribes of all the rabble of the forum, andthrew it into four, and called them city tribes. And this procedure,we are told, gave such universal satisfaction, that, by thisregulation in the orders of the state, he obtained the surname ofMaximus, which he had not obtained by his many victories. The annualreview of the knights, on the ides of July, is also said to have beeninstituted by him."Book 10,Chapter 1,"During the consulate of Lucius Genucius and Servius Cornelius, thestate enjoyed almost uninterrupted rest from foreign wars. Colonieswere led out to Sora and Alba. For the latter, situated in the countryof the Aequans, six thousand colonists were enrolled. Sora hadformerly belonged to the Volscian territory, but had fallen into thepossession of the Samnites: thither were sent four thousand settlers.This year the freedom of the state was granted to the Arpinians andTrebulans. The Frusinonians were fined a third part of their lands,because it was discovered that the Hernicians had been tampered withby them; and the heads of that conspiracy, after a trial before theconsuls, held in pursuance of a decree of the senate, were beaten withrods and beheaded. However, that the Romans might not pass the yearentirely exempt from war, a little expedition was made into Umbria;intelligence being received from thence, that excursions of men, inarms, had been made, from a certain cave, into the adjacent country.Into this cave the troops penetrated with their standards, and, theplace being dark, they received many wounds, chiefly from stonesthrown. At length the other mouth of the cave being found, for it waspervious, both the openings were filled up with wood, which being seton fire, there perished by means of the smoke and heat, no less thantwo thousand men; many of whom, at the last, in attempting to maketheir way out, rushed into the very flames. The two Marci, LiviusDenter and Aemilius, succeeding to the consulship, war was renewedwith the Aequans; who, being highly displeased at the colonyestablished within their territory, as if it were a fortress, havingmade an attempt, with their whole force, to seize it, were repulsed bythe colonists themselves. They caused, however, such an alarm at Rome,that, to quell this insurrection, Caius Junius Bubulcus was nominateddictator: for it was scarcely credible that the Aequans, after beingreduced to such a degree of weakness, should by themselves alone haveventured to engage in a war. The dictator, taking the field, withMarcus Titinius, master of the horse, in the first engagement reducedthe Aequans to submission; and returning into the city in triumph, onthe eighth day, dedicated, in the character of dictator, the temple ofHealth, which he had vowed when consul, and contracted for whencensor."Book 10,Chapter 2,"During this year a fleet of Grecians, under the command ofCleonymus, a Lacedaemonian, arrived on the coast of Italy, and tookThuriae, a city in the territory of the Sallentines. Against thisenemy the consul Aemilius was sent, who, in one battle, completelydefeated them, and drove them on board their ships. Thuriae was thenrestored to its old inhabitants, and peace re-established in thecountry of the Sallentines. In some annals, I find that JuniusBubulcus was sent dictator into that country, and that Cleonymus,without hazarding an engagement with the Romans, retired out of Italy.He then sailed round the promontory of Brundusium, and, steering downthe middle of the Adriatic gulf, because he dreaded, on the left hand,the coasts of Italy destitute of harbours, and, on the right, theIllyrians, Liburnians, and Istrians, nations of savages, and noted ingeneral for piracy, he passed on to the coasts of the Venetians. Here,having landed a small party to explore the country, and being informedthat a narrow beach stretched along the shore, beyond which weremarshes, overflowed by the tides; that dry land was seen at no greatdistance, level in the nearest part, and rising behind into hills,beyond which was the mouth of a very deep river, into which they hadseen ships brought round and moored in safety, (this was the riverMeduacus,) he ordered his fleet to sail into it and go up against thestream. As the channel would not admit the heavy ships, the troops,removing into the lighter vessels, arrived at a part of the countryoccupied by three maritime cantons of the Patavians, settled on thatcoast. Here they made a descent, leaving a small guard with the ships,made themselves masters of these cantons, set fire to the houses,drove off a considerable booty of men and cattle, and, allured by thesweets of plunder, proceeded still further from the shore. When newsof this was brought to Patavium, where the contiguity of the Gaulskept the inhabitants constantly in arms, they divided their young meninto two bands, one of which was led towards the quarter where themarauders were said to be busy; the other by a different route, toavoid meeting any of the pirates, towards the station of the ships,fifteen miles distant from the town. An attack was made on the smallcraft, and the guards being killed, the affrighted mariners wereobliged to remove their ships to the other bank of the river. By land,also, the attack on the dispersed plunderers was equally successful;and the Grecians, flying back towards their ships, were opposed intheir way by the Venetians. Thus they were enclosed on both sides, andcut to pieces; and some, who were made prisoners, gave informationthat the fleet, with their king, Cleonymus, was but three milesdistant. Sending the captives into the nearest canton, to be keptunder a guard, some soldiers got on board the flat-bottomed vessels,so constructed for the purpose of passing the shoals with ease; othersembarked in those which had been lately taken from the enemy, andproceeding down the river, surrounded their unwieldy ships, whichdreaded the unknown sands and flats more than they did the Romans, andwhich showed a greater eagerness to escape into the deep than to makeresistance. The soldiers pursued them as far as the mouth of theriver; and having taken and burned a part of the fleet, which in thehurry and confusion had been stranded, returned victorious. Cleonymus,having met success in no part of the Adriatic sea, departed withscarce a fifth part of his navy remaining. Many, now alive, have seenthe beaks of his ships, and the spoils of the Lacedaemonians, hangingin the old temple of Juno. In commemoration of this event, there isexhibited at Patavium, every year, on its anniversary day, a navalcombat on the river in the middle of the town."Book 10,Chapter 3,"A treaty was this year concluded at Rome with the Vestinians, whosolicited friendship. Various causes of apprehension afterwards sprungup. News arrived, that Etruria was in rebellion; the insurrectionhaving arisen from the dissensions of the Arretians; for the Cilnianfamily having grown exorbitantly powerful, a party, out of envy oftheir wealth, had attempted to expel them by force of arms. [Accountswere also received] that the Marsians held forcible possession of thelands to which the colony of Carseoli, consisting of four thousandmen, had been sent. By reason, therefore, of these commotions, MarcusValerius Maximus was nominated dictator, and chose for his master ofthe horse Marcus Aemilius Paullus. This I am inclined to believe,rather than that Quintus Fabius, at such an age as he then was, andafter enjoying many honours, was placed in a station subordinate toValerius: but I think it not unlikely that the mistake arose from thesurname Maximus. The dictator, having set out at the head of an army,in one battle utterly defeated the Marsians, drove them into theirfortified towns, and afterwards, in the course of a few days, tookMilionia, Plestina, and Fresilia; and then finding Marsians in a partof their lands, granted them a renewal of the treaty. The war was thendirected against the Etrurians; and when the dictator had gone toRome, for the purpose of renewing the auspices, the master of thehorse, going out to forage, was surrounded by an ambuscade, andobliged to fly shamefully into his camp, after losing severalstandards and many of his men. The occurrence of which discomfiture toFabius is exceedingly improbable; not only because, if in anyparticular, certainly, above all, in the qualifications of acommander, he fully merited his surname; but besides, mindful ofPapirius's severity, he never could have been tempted to fight,without the dictator's orders."Book 10,Chapter 4,"The news of this disaster excited at Rome an alarm greater thansuited the importance of the affair; for, as if the army had beendestroyed, a justitium was proclaimed, guards mounted at the gates,and watches set in every street: and armour and weapons were heaped onthe walls. All the younger citizens being compelled to enlist, thedictator was ordered to join the army. There he found every thing in amore tranquil state than he expected, and regularity establishedthrough the care of the master of the horse, the camp removed to aplace of greater safety, the cohorts, which had lost their standards,left without tents on the outside of the ramparts and the troopsardently impatient for battle, that their disgrace might be the soonerobliterated. He therefore immediately advanced his camp into theterritory of Rusella. Thither the enemy also followed, and although,since their late success, they entertained the most sanguine hopesfrom an open trial of strength, yet they endeavoured to circumvent theenemy by a stratagem which they had before practised with success.There were, at a small distance from the Roman camp, the half-ruinedhouses of a town which had been burnt in the devastation of thecountry. A body of troops being concealed there, some cattle wasdriven on, within view of a Roman post, commanded by alieutenant-general, Cneius Fulvius. When no one was induced by thistemptation to stir from his post, one of the herdsmen, advancing closeto the works, called out, that others were driving out those cattle attheir leisure from the ruins of the town, why did they remain idle,when they might safely drive them through the middle of the Romancamp? When this was interpreted to the lieutenant-general, by somenatives of Caere, and great impatience prevailed through every companyof the soldiers, who, nevertheless, dared not to move without orders,he commanded some who were skilled in the language to observeattentively, whether the dialect of the herdsmen resembled that ofrustics or of citizens. When these reported, that their accent inspeaking, their manner and appearance, were all of a more polishedcast than suited shepherds, ""Go then,"" said he, ""tell them that theymay uncover the ambush which they vainly conceal, that the Romansunderstand all their devices, and can now be no more taken bystratagem than they can be conquered by arms."" When these words wereheard, and carried to those who lay in ambush, they immediately arosefrom their lurking place, and marched out in order into the plainwhich was open to view on every side The lieutenant-general thoughttheir force too powerful for his small band to cope with. He thereforesent in haste to Valerius for support, and in the mean time, byhimself, sustained the enemy's onset."Book 10,Chapter 5,"On receiving his message, the dictator ordered the standards tomove, and the troops to follow in arms. But every thing was executedmore quickly, almost, than ordered. The standards and arms wereinstantly snatched up, and they were with difficulty restrained fromrunning impetuously on, both indignation at their late defeatstimulated them, as well as the shouts striking their ears withincreasing vehemence, as the contest grew hotter They therefore urgedeach other, and pressed the standard-bearers to quicken their pace.The dictator, the more eagerly he saw them push forward, took the morepains to repress their haste, and ordered them to march at a slowerrate. On the other side, the Etrurians, putting themselves in motion,on the first beginning of the fray had come up with their whole force,and several expresses came to the dictator, one after another, thatall the regions of the Etrurians had joined in the fight, and that hismen could not any longer withstand them: at the same time, he himselfsaw, from the higher ground, in how perilous a situation the partywas. Confident, however, that the lieutenant-general was able, evenyet, to support the contest, and considering that he himself was athand to rescue him from defeat, he wished to let the enemy befatigued, as much as might be, in order that, when in that state, hemight fall on them with his fresh troops. Slowly as these marched, thedistance was now just sufficient for the cavalry to begin their careerfor a charge. The battalions of the legions marched in front, lest theenemy might suspect any secret or sudden movement, but intervals hadbeen left in the ranks of the infantry, affording room for the horsesto gallop through. At the same instant the line raised the shout, andthe cavalry, charging at full speed, poured on the enemy, and spreadat once a general panic. After this, as succour had arrived, almosttoo late, to the party surrounded, so now they were allowed entirerest, the fresh troops taking on themselves the whole business of thefight. Nor was that either long or dubious. The enemy, now routed,fled to their camp, and the Romans advancing to attack it, they gaveway, and are crowded all together in the remotest part of it. In theirflight they are obstructed by the narrowness of the gates, the greaternumber climbed up on the mounds and ramparts, to try if they couldeither defend themselves with the aid of the advantageous ground, orget over, by any means, and escape. One part of the rampart, happeningto be badly compacted sunk under the weight of the multitude who stoodon it, and fell into the trench. On which, crying out that the godshad opened that pass to give them safety, they made their way out,most of them leaving their arms behind. By this battle the power ofthe Etrurians was, a second time, effectually crushed, so that,engaging to furnish a year's pay, and corn for two months, with thedictator's permission, they sent ambassadors to Rome to treat ofpeace. This was refused, but a truce for two years was granted tothem. The dictator returned into the city in triumph. I have seen itasserted, that tranquillity was restored in Etruria by the dictator,without any memorable battle, only by composing the dissensions of theArretians, and effecting a reconciliation between the Cilnian familyand the commons. Marcus Valerius was elected consul, before theexpiration of his dictatorship, many have believed, without hissoliciting the office, and even while he was absent; and that theelection was held by an interrex. In one point all agree, that he heldthe consulship with Quintus Appulcius Pansa."Book 10,Chapter 6,"During this consulate of Marcus Valerius and Quintus Appulcius,affairs abroad wore a very peaceable aspect. Their losses sustained inwar, together with the truce, kept the Etrurians quiet. The Samnites,depressed by the misfortunes of many years, had not yet becomedissatisfied with their new alliance. At Rome, also, the carrying awayof such multitudes to colonies, rendered the commons tranquil, andlightened their burthens. But, that things might not be tranquil onall sides, a contention was excited between the principal persons inthe commonwealth, patricians on one hand, and plebeians on the other,by the two Ogulnii, Quintus and Cneius, plebeian tribunes, who,seeking every where occasions of criminating the patricians in thehearing of the people, and having found other attempts fruitless, seton foot a proceeding by which they might inflame, not the lowest classof the commons, but their chief men, the plebeians of consular andtriumphal rank, to the completion of whose honours nothing was nowwanting but the offices of the priesthood, which were not yet laidopen to them. They therefore published a proposal for a law, that,whereas there were then four augurs and four pontiffs, and it had beendetermined that the number of priests should be augmented, the fouradditional pontiffs and five augurs should all be chosen out of thecommons. How the college of augurs could be reduced to the number offour, except by the death of two, I do not understand: for it is arule among the augurs, that their number should be composed of threes,so that the three ancient tribes, the Ramnes, Titienses, and Luceres,should have each its own augur; or, in case there should be occasionfor more, that each should increase its number of augurs, in equalproportion with the rest, in like manner as when, by the addition offive to four, they made up the number nine, so that there were threeto each tribe. However, as it was proposed that they should be chosenout of the commons, the patricians were as highly offended at theproceeding, as when they saw the consulship made common; yet theypretended that the business concerned not them so much as it did thegods, who would ""take care that their own worship should not becontaminated; that, for their parts, they only wished that nomisfortune might ensue to the commonwealth."" But they made a lessvigorous opposition, as being now accustomed to suffer defeat in suchkind of disputes; and they saw their adversaries, not, as formerly,grasping at that which they could scarcely hope to reach, the higherhonours; but already in possession of all those advantages, on theuncertain prospect of which they had maintained the contest, manifoldconsulships, censorships, and triumphs."Book 10,Chapter 7,"The principal struggle, however, in supporting and opposing thebill, they say, was between Appius Claudius and Publius Decius Mus.After these had urged nearly the same topics, respecting theprivileges of patricians and plebeians, which had been formerlyemployed for and against the Licinian law, when the proposition wasbrought forward of opening the consulship to plebeians, Decius is saidto have drawn a lively description of his own father, such as manythen present in the assembly had seen him, girt in the Gabine dress,standing on a spear, in the attitude in which he had devoted himselffor the people and the legions, and to have added, that the consulPublius Decius was then deemed by the immortal gods an offeringequally pure and pious, as if his colleague, Titus Manlius, had beendevoted. And might not the same Publius Decius have been, withpropriety, chosen to perform the public worship of the Roman people?Was there any danger that the gods would give less attention to hisprayers than to those of Appius Claudius? Did the latter perform hisprivate acts of adoration with a purer mind, or worship the gods morereligiously than he? Who had any reason to complain of the vowsoffered in behalf of the commonwealth, by so many plebeian consuls anddictators, either when setting out to their armies, or in the heat ofbattle? Were the numbers of commanders reckoned, during those yearssince business began to be transacted under the conduct and auspicesof plebeians, the same number of triumphs might be found. The commonshad now no reason to be dissatisfied with their own nobility. On thecontrary, they were fully convinced, that in case of a sudden warbreaking out, the senate and people of Rome would not repose greaterconfidence in patrician than in plebeian commanders. ""Which being thecase,"" said he, ""what god or man can deem it an impropriety, if thosewhom ye have honoured with curule chairs, with the purple borderedgown, with the palm-vest and embroidered robe, with the triumphalcrown and laurel, whose houses ye have rendered conspicuous aboveothers, by affixing to them the spoils of conquered enemies, shouldadd to these the badges of augurs or pontiffs? If a person, who hasrode through the city in a gilt chariot; and, decorated with theensigns of Jupiter, supremely good and great, has mounted the Capitol,should be seen with a chalice and wand; what impropriety, I say, thathe should, with his head veiled, slay a victim, or take an augury inthe citadel? When, in the inscription on a person's statue, theconsulship, censorship, and triumph shall be read with patience, willthe eyes of readers be unable to endure the addition of the office ofaugur or pontiff? In truth (with deference to the gods I say it) Itrust that we are, through the kindness of the Roman people, qualifiedin such a manner that we should, by the dignity of our characters,reflect back, on the priesthood, not less lustre than we shouldreceive; and may demand, rather on behalf of the gods, than for ourown sakes, that those whom we worship in our private we may alsoworship in a public capacity."""Book 10,Chapter 8,"""But why do I argue thus, as if the cause of the patricians,respecting the priesthood, were untouched? and as if we were notalready in possession of one sacerdotal office, of the highest class?We see plebeian decemvirs, for performing sacrifices, interpreters ofthe Sibylline prophecies, and of the fates of the nation; we also seethem presidents of Apollo's festival, and of other religiousperformances. Neither was any injustice done to the patricians, when,to the two commissioners for performing sacrifices, an additionalnumber was joined, in favour of the plebeians; nor is there now, whena tribune, a man of courage and activity, wishes to add five places ofaugurs, and four of pontiffs, to which plebeians may be nominated; notAppius, with intent to expel you from your places; but, that men ofplebeian rank may assist you, in the management of divine affairs,with the same zeal with which they assist you in matters of humanconcernment. Blush not, Appius, at having a man your colleague in thepriesthood, whom you might have a colleague in the censorship orconsulship, whose master of the horse you yourself may be, when he isdictator, as well as dictator when he is master of the horse. A Sabineadventurer, the first origin of your nobility, either Attus Clausus,or Appius Claudius, which you will, the ancient patricians of thosedays admitted into their number: do not then, on your part, disdain toadmit us into the number of priests. We bring with us numeroushonours; all those honours, indeed, which have rendered your party soproud. Lucius Sextius was the first consul chosen out of theplebeians; Caius Licinius Stolo, the first master of the horse; CaiusMarcius Rutilus, the first dictator, and likewise censor; QuintusPublilius Philo, the first praetor. On all occasions was heard arepetition of the same arguments; that the right of auspices wasvested in you; that ye alone had the rights of ancestry; that ye alonewere legally entitled to the supreme command, and the auspices both inpeace and war. The supreme command has hitherto been, and willcontinue to be, equally prosperous in plebeian hands as in patrician.Have ye never heard it said, that the first created patricians werenot men sent down from heaven, but such as could cite their fathers,that is, nothing more than free born. I can now cite my father, aconsul; and my son will be able to cite a grandfather. Citizens, thereis nothing else in it, than that we should never obtain any thingwithout a refusal. The patricians wish only for a dispute; nor do theycare what issue their disputes may have. For my part, be itadvantageous, happy, and prosperous to you and to the commonwealth, Iam of opinion that this law should receive your sanction."""Book 10,Chapter 9,"The people ordered that the tribes should be instantly called; andthere was every appearance that the law would be accepted. It wasdeferred, however, for that day, by a protest, from which on the dayfollowing the tribunes were deterred; and it passed with theapprobation of a vast majority. The pontiffs created were, PubliusDecius Mus, the advocate for the law; Publius Sempronius Sophus, CaiusMarcius Rutilus, and Marcus Livius Denter. The five augurs, who werealso plebeians, were, Caius Genucius, Publius Aelius Paetus, MarcusMinucius Fessus, Caius Marcius, and Titus Publilius. Thus the numberof the pontiffs was made eight; that of the augurs nine. In the sameyear Marcus Valerius, consul, procured a law to be passed concerningappeals; more carefully enforced by additional sanctions. This was thethird time, since the expulsion of the kings, of this law beingintroduced, and always by the same family. The reason for renewing itso often was, I believe, no other, than that the influence of a fewwas apt to prove too powerful for the liberty of the commons. However,the Porcian law seems intended, solely, for the security of thepersons of the citizens; as it visited with a severe penalty any onefor beating with stripes or putting to death a Roman citizen. TheValerian law, after forbidding a person, who had appealed, to bebeaten with rods and beheaded, added, in case of any one actingcontrary thereto, that it shall yet be only deemed a wicked act. This,I suppose, was judged of sufficient strength to enforce obedience tothe law in those days; so powerful was then men's sense of shame; atpresent one would scarcely make use of such a threat seriously. TheAequans rebelling, the same consul conducted the war against them; inwhich no memorable event occurred; for, except ferocity, they retainednothing of their ancient condition. The other consul, Appuleius,invested the town of Nequinum in Umbria. The ground, the same whereonNarnia now stands, was steep (on one side even perpendicular); thisrendered the town impregnable either by assault or works. Thatbusiness, therefore, came unfinished into the hands of the succeedingconsuls, Marcus Fulvius Paetinus and Titus Manlius Torquatus. When allthe centuries named Quintus Fabius consul for that year though not acandidate, Macer Licinius and Tubero state that he himself recommendedthem to postpone the conferring the consulship on him until a yearwherein there might be more employment for their arms; adding, that,during the present year, he might be more useful to the state in themanagement of a city magistracy; and thus, neither dissembling what hepreferred, nor yet making direct application for it, he was appointedcurule aedile with Lucius Papirius Cursor. Piso, a more ancient writerof annals, prevents me from averring this as certain; he asserts thatthe curule aediles of that year were Caius Domitius Calvinus, son ofCneius, and Spurius Carvilius Maximus, son of Caius. I am of opinion,that this latter surname caused a mistake concerning the aediles; andthat thence followed a story conformable to this mistake, patched upout of the two elections, of the aediles, and of the consuls. Thegeneral survey was performed, this year, by Publius Sempronius Sophusand Publius Sulpicius Saverrio, censors; and two tribes were added,the Aniensian and Terentine. Such were the occurrences at Rome."Book 10,Chapter 10,"Meanwhile, after much time had been lost in the tedious siege ofNequinum, two of the townsmen, whose houses were contiguous to thewall, having formed a subterraneous passage, came by that private wayto the Roman advanced guards; and being conducted thence to theconsul, offered to give admittance to a body of armed men within theworks and walls. The proposal was thought to be such as ought neitherto be rejected, nor yet assented to without caution. With one of thesemen, the other being detained as an hostage, two spies were sentthrough the mine, and certain information being received from them,three hundred men in arms, guided by the deserter, entered the city,and seized by night the nearest gate, which being broken open, theRoman consul and his army took possession of the city without anyopposition. In this manner came Nequinum under the dominion of theRoman people. A colony was sent thither as a barrier against theUmbrians, and called Narnia, from the river Nar. The troops returnedto Rome with abundance of spoil. This year the Etrurians madepreparations for war in violation of the truce. But a vast army of theGauls, making an irruption into their territories, while theirattention was directed to another quarter, suspended for a time theexecution of their design. They then, relying on the abundance ofmoney which they possessed, endeavour to make allies of the Gauls,instead of enemies; in order that, with their armies combined, theymight attack the Romans. The barbarians made no objection to thealliance, and a negotiation was opened for settling the price; whichbeing adjusted and paid, and every thing else being in readiness forcommencing their operations, the Etrurians desired them to accompanythem in their march. This they refused, alleging that ""they hadstipulated a price for making war against the Romans: that the paymentalready made, they had received in consideration of their not wastingthe Etrurian territory, or using their arms against the inhabitants.That notwithstanding, if it was the wish of the Etrurians, they werestill willing to engage in the war, but on no other condition thanthat of being allowed a share of their lands, and obtaining at lengthsome permanent settlement."" Many assemblies of the states of Etruriawere held on this subject, and nothing could be settled; not so muchby reason of their aversion from the dismemberment of their territory,as because every one felt a dread of fixing in so close vicinity tothemselves people of such a savage race. The Gauls were thereforedismissed, and carried home an immense sum of money, acquired withouttoil or danger. The report of a Gallic tumult, in addition to anEtrurian war, had caused serious apprehensions at Rome; and, with theless hesitation on that account, an alliance was concluded with thestate of the Picentians."Book 10,Chapter 11,"The province of Etruria fell by lot to the consul Titus Manlius;who, when he had but just entered the enemy's country, as he wasexercising the cavalry, in wheeling about at full speed, was thrownfrom his horse, and almost killed on the spot; three days after thefall, he died. The Etrurians, embracing this omen, as it were, of thefuture progress of the war, and observing that the gods had commencedhostilities on their behalf, assumed new courage. At Rome the newscaused great affliction, on account both of the loss of such a man andof the unseasonableness of the juncture; insomuch that an assembly,held for the purpose of substituting a new consul, having beenconducted agreeably to the wishes of people of the first consequence,prevented the senate from ordering a dictator to be created. All thevotes and centuries concurred unanimously in appointing MarcusValerius consul, the same whom the senate would have ordered to bemade dictator. They then commanded him to proceed immediately intoEtruria, to the legions. His coming gave such a check to theEtrurians, that not one of them dared thenceforward to appear on theoutside of their trenches; their own fears operating as a blockade.Nor could the new consul, by wasting their lands and burning theirhouses, draw them out to an engagement; for not only country-houses,but numbers of their towns, were seen smoking and in ashes, on everyside. While this war proceeded more slowly than had been expected, anaccount was received of the breaking out of another; which was, notwithout reason, regarded as terrible, in consequence of the heavylosses formerly sustained by both parties, from information given bytheir new allies, the Picentians, that the Samnites were looking toarms and a renewal of hostilities, and that they themselves had beensolicited to join therein. The Picentians received the thanks of thestate; and a large share of the attention of the senate was turnedfrom Etruria towards Samnium. The dearness of provisions alsodistressed the state very much, and they would have felt the extremityof want, according to the relation of those who make Fabius Maximuscurule aedile that year, had not the vigilant activity of that man,such as he had on many occasions displayed in the field, been exertedthen with equal zeal at home, in the management of the market, and inprocuring and forming magazines of corn. An interregnum took placethis year, the reason of which is not mentioned. Appius Claudius, and,after him, Publius Sulpicius, were interreges. The latter held anelection of consuls, and chose Lucius Cornelius Scipio and CneiusFulvius. In the beginning of this year, ambassadors came from theLucanians to the new consuls to complain, that ""the Samnites, findingthat they could not, by any offers, tempt them to take part in thewar, had marched an army in a hostile manner into their country, andwere now laying it waste, and forcing them into a war; that theLucanian people had on former occasions erred enough and more thanenough; that their minds were so firmly fixed that they thought itmore endurable to bear and suffer every hardship, rather than everagain to outrage the Roman name: they besought the senate to take thepeople of Lucania into their protection, and defend them from theinjustice and outrage of the Samnites; that although fidelity on theirpart to the Romans would now become necessary, a war being undertakenagainst the Samnites, still they were ready to give hostages."""Book 10,Chapter 12,"The deliberation of the senate was short. They all, to a man,concurred in opinion, that a compact should be entered into with theLucanians, and satisfaction demanded from the Samnites: accordingly, afavourable answer was returned to the Lucanians, and the allianceconcluded. Heralds were then sent, to require of the Samnites, thatthey should depart from the country of the allies, and withdraw theirtroops from the Lucanian territory. These were met by personsdespatched for the purpose by the Samnites, who gave them warning,that ""if they appeared at any assembly in Samnium, they must notexpect to depart in safety."" As soon as this was heard at Rome, thesenate voted, and the people ordered, that war should be declaredagainst the Samnites. The consuls, then, dividing the provincesbetween them, Etruria fell to Scipio, the Samnites to Fulvius; andthey set out by different routes, each against the enemy allotted tohim. Scipio, while he expected a tedious campaign, like that of thepreceding year, was met near Volaterra by the Etrurians, in order ofbattle. The fight lasted through the greater part of the day, whilevery many fell on both sides, and night came on while it was uncertainto which side victory inclined. But the following dawn showed theconqueror and the vanquished; for the Etrurians had decamped in thedead of the night. The Romans, marching out with intent to renew theengagement, and seeing their superiority acknowledged by the departureof the enemy, advanced to their camp; and, finding even this fortifiedpost deserted, took possession of it, evacuated as it was, togetherwith a vast quantity of spoil. The consul then, leading back hisforces into the Faliscian territory, and leaving his baggage with asmall guard at Falerii, set out with his troops, lightly accoutred, toravage the enemy's country. All places are destroyed with fire andsword; plunder driven from every side; and not only was the groundleft a mere waste to the enemy, but their forts and small towns wereset on fire; he refrained from attacking the cities into which fearhad driven the Etrurians. The consul Cneius Fulvius fought a gloriousbattle in Samnium, near Bovianum, attended with success by no meansequivocal. Then, having attacked Bovianum, and not long afterAufidena, he took them by storm."Book 10,Chapter 13,"When the consular elections were now at hand, a report prevailed,that the Etrurians and Samnites were raising vast armies; that theleaders of the Etrurians were, in all their assemblies, openlycensured for not having procured the aid of the Gauls on any terms;and the magistrates of the Samnites arraigned, for having opposed tothe Romans an army destined to act against the Lucanians. That, inconsequence, the people were rising up in arms, with all their ownstrength and that of their allies combined; and that this affairseemed not likely to be terminated without a contest of much greaterdifficulty than the former. Although the candidates for the consulshipwere men of illustrious characters, yet this alarming intelligenceturned the thoughts of all on Quintus Fabius Maximus, who sought notthe employment at first, and afterwards, when he discovered theirwishes, even declined it. ""Why,"" said he, ""should they impose such adifficult task on him, who was now in the decline of life, and hadpassed through a full course of labours, and of the rewards of labour?Neither the vigour of his body, nor of his mind, remained the same;and he dreaded fortune herself, lest to some god she should seem toobountiful to him, and more constant than the course of human affairsallowed. He had himself succeeded, in gradual succession, to thedignities of his seniors; and he beheld, with great satisfaction,others rising up to succeed to his glory. There was no scarcity atRome, either of honours suited to men of the highest merit, or of menof eminent merit suited to the highest honours."" This disinterestedconduct, instead of repressing, increased, while in fact it justifiedtheir zeal. But thinking that this ought to be checked by respect forthe laws, he ordered that clause to be read aloud by which it was notlawful that the same person shall be re-elected consul within tenyears. The law was scarcely heard in consequence of the clamour; andthe tribunes of the commons declared, that this ""decree should be noimpediment; for they would propose an order to the people, that heshould be exempted from the obligation of the laws."" Still hepersisted in his opposition, asking, ""To what purpose were lawsenacted, if they eluded by the very persons who procured them? Thelaws now,"" he said, ""instead of being rulers, were overruled."" Thepeople, nevertheless, proceeded to vote; and, according as eachcentury was called in, it immediately named Fabius consul. Then atlength, overcome by the universal wish of the state, he said, ""Romans,may the gods approve your present, and all your future proceedings.But since, with respect to me, ye intend to act according to your ownwills, let my interest find room with you, with respect to mycolleague. I earnestly request, that ye will place in the consulshipwith me Publius Decius; a man with whom I have already experienced theutmost harmony in our joint administration of that office; a manworthy of you, worthy of his father."" The recommendation was deemedwell founded, and all the remaining centuries voted Quintus Fabius andPublius Decius consuls. This year, great numbers were prosecuted bythe aediles, for having in possession larger quantities of land thanthe state allowed; and hardly any were acquitted: by which means, avery great restraint was laid on exorbitant covetousness."Book 10,Chapter 14,"Whilst the new consuls, Quintus Fabius Maximus a fourth, andPublius Decius Mus a third time, were settling between themselves thatone should command against the Samnites, and the other against theEtrurians; and what number of forces would be sufficient for this andfor that province; and which would be the fitter commander in eachwar; ambassadors from Sutrium, Nepete, and Falerii, stating that thestates of Etruria were holding assemblies on the subject of suing forpeace, they directed the whole force of their arms against Samnium.The consuls, in order that the supply of provisions might be the moreready, and to leave the enemy in the greater uncertainty on whatquarter the war would fall, Fabius led his legions towards Samniumthrough the territory of Sora, and Decius his through that ofSidicinum. As soon as they arrived at the frontiers of the enemy, bothadvanced briskly, spreading devastation wherever they came; but stillthey explore the country, to a distance beyond where the troops wereemployed in plundering. Accordingly the fact did not escape the noticeof the Romans, that the enemy were drawn up in a retired valley, nearTifernum, which, when the Romans entered, they were preparing toattack them from the higher ground. Fabius, sending away his baggageto a place of safety, and setting a small guard over it, and havinggiven notice to his soldiers that a battle was at hand, advanced in asquare body to the hiding-place of the enemy already mentioned. TheSamnites, disappointed in making an unexpected attack, determined on aregular engagement, as the matter was now likely to come to an opencontest. They therefore marched out into the plain; and, with agreater share of spirit than of hopes, committed themselves to thedisposal of fortune. However, whether in consequence of their havingdrawn together, from every state, the whole of the force which itpossessed, or that the consideration of their all being at stake,heightened their courage, they occasioned, even in open fight, aconsiderable alarm. Fabius, when he saw that the enemy in no placegave way, ordered Marcus Fulvius and Marcus Valerius, militarytribunes, with whom he hastened to the front, to go to the cavalry,and to exhort them, that, ""if they remembered any instance wherein thepublic had received advantage from the service of the horsemen, theywould, on that day, exert themselves to insure the invincible renownof that body; telling them that the enemy stood immovable against theefforts of the infantry, and the only hope remaining was in the chargeof horse."" He addressed particularly both these youths, and with thesame cordiality, loading them with praises and promises. Butconsidering that, in case that effort should also fail, it would benecessary to accomplish by stratagem what his strength could noteffect; he ordered Scipio, one of his lieutenants-general, to drawoff the spearmen of the first legion out of the line; to lead themround as secretly as possible to the nearest mountains; and, by anascent concealed from view, to gain the heights, and show himselfsuddenly on the rear of the enemy. The cavalry, led on by thetribunes, rushing forward unexpectedly before the van, caused scarcelymore confusion among the enemy than among their friends. The line ofthe Samnites stood firm against the furious onset of the squadrons; itneither could be driven from its ground, nor broken in any part. Thecavalry, finding their attempts fruitless, withdrew from the fight,and retired behind the line of infantry. On this the enemies' courageincreased, so that the Roman troops in the van would not have beenable to support the contest, nor the force thus increasing byconfidence in itself, had not the second line, by the consul's order,come up into the place of the first. These fresh troops checked theprogress of the Samnites, who had now began to gain ground; and, atthis seasonable juncture, their comrades appearing suddenly on themountains, and raising a shout, occasioned in the Samnites a fear ofgreater danger than really threatened them; Fabius called out aloudthat his colleague Decius was approaching; on which all the soldiers,elated with joy, repeated eagerly, that the other consul was come, thelegions were arrived! This artifice, useful to the Romans, filled theSamnites with dismay and terror; terrified chiefly lest fatigued asthey were, they should be overpowered by another army fresh andunhurt. As they dispersed themselves in their flight on every side,there was less effusion of blood than might have been expected,considering the completeness of the victory. There were three thousandfour hundred slain, about eight hundred and thirty made prisoners, andtwenty-three military standards taken."Book 10,Chapter 15,"The Apulians would have joined their forces to the Samnites beforethis battle, had not the consul, Publius Decius, encamped in theirneighbourhood at Maleventum; and, finding means to bring them to anengagement, put them to the rout. Here, likewise, there was more offlight than of bloodshed. Two thousand of the Apulians were slain; butDecius, despising such an enemy, led his legions into Samnium. Therethe two consular armies, overrunning every part of the country duringthe space of five months, laid it entirely waste. There were inSamnium forty-five places where Decius, and eighty-six where the otherconsul, encamped. Nor did they leave traces only of having been there,as ramparts and trenches, but other dreadful mementos of it--generaldesolation and regions depopulated. Fabius also took the city ofCimetra, where he made prisoners two thousand four hundred soldiers;and there were slain in the assault about four hundred and thirty.Going thence to Rome to preside at the elections, he used allexpedition in despatching that business. All the first-calledcenturies voted Quintus Fabius consul. Appius Claudius was acandidate, a man of consular rank, daring and ambitious; and as hewished not more ardently for the attainment of that honour forhimself, than he did that the patricians might recover the possessionof both places in the consulship, he laboured, with all his own power,supported by that of the whole body of the nobility, to prevail onthem to appoint him consul along with Quintus Fabius. To this Fabiusobjected, giving, at first, the same reasons which he had advanced theyear before. The nobles then all gathered round his seat, and besoughthim to raise up the consulship out of the plebeian mire, and torestore both to the office itself, and to the patrician rank, theiroriginal dignity. Fabius then, procuring silence, allayed their warmthby a qualifying speech, declaring, that ""he would have so managed, asto have received the names of two patricians, if he had seen anintention of appointing any other than himself to the consulship. Asthings now stood, he would not set so bad a precedent as to admit hisown name among the candidates; such a proceeding being contrary to thelaws."" Whereupon Appius Claudius, and Lucius Volumnius, a plebeian,who had likewise been colleagues in that office before, were electedconsuls. The nobility reproached Fabius for declining to act inconjunction with Appius Claudius, because he evidently excelled him ineloquence and political abilities."Book 10,Chapter 16,"When the election was finished, the former consuls, their commandbeing continued for six months, were ordered to prosecute the war inSamnium. Accordingly, during this next year also, in the consulate ofLucius Volumnius and Appius Claudius, Publius Decius, who had beenleft consul in Samnium by his colleague, in the character ofproconsul, ceased not to spread devastation through all parts of thatcountry; until, at last, he drove the army of the Samnites, whichnever dared to face him in the field, entirely out of the country.Thus expelled from home, they bent their route to Etruria; and,supposing that the business, which they had often in vain endeavouredto accomplish by embassies, might now be negotiated with more effect,when they were backed by such a powerful armed force, and couldintermix terror with their entreaties, they demanded a meeting of thechiefs of Etruria: which being assembled, they set forth the greatnumber of years during which they had waged war with the Romans, inthe cause of liberty; ""they had,"" they said, ""tried to sustain, withtheir own strength, the weight of so great a war: they had also madetrial of the support of the adjoining nations, which proved of littleavail. When they were unable longer to maintain the conflict, they hadsued the Roman people for peace; and had again taken up arms, becausethey felt peace was more grievous to those with servitude, than war tofree men. That their one only hope remaining rested in the Etrurians.They knew that nation to be the most powerful in Italy, in respect ofarms, men, and money; to have the Gauls their closest neighbours, bornin the midst of war and arms, of furious courage, both from theirnatural temper, and particularly against the people of Rome, whom theyboasted, without infringing the truth, of having made their prisoners,and of having ransomed for gold. If the Etrurians possessed the samespirit which formerly Porsena and their ancestors once had, there wasnothing to prevent their obliging the Romans, driven from all thelands on this side of the Tiber, to fight for their own existence, andnot for the intolerable dominion which they assumed over Italy. TheSamnite army had come to them, in readiness for action, furnished witharms and pay, and were willing to follow that instant, even shouldthey lead to the attack of the city of Rome itself."""Book 10,Chapter 17,"While they were engaged in these representations, and intriguingat Etruria, the operations of the Romans in their own territoriesdistressed them severely. For Publius Decius, when he ascertainedthrough his scouts the departure of the Samnite army, called acouncil, and there said, ""Why do we ramble through the country,carrying the war from village to village? Why not attack the citiesand fortified places? No army now guards Samnium. They have fled theircountry; they are gone into voluntary exile."" The proposal beinguniversally approved, he marched to attack Murgantia, a city ofconsiderable strength; and so great was the ardour of the soldiers,resulting from their affection to their commander, and from theirhopes of richer treasure than could be found in pillaging the countryplaces, that in one day they took it by assault. Here, two thousandone hundred of the Samnites, making resistance, were surrounded andtaken prisoners; and abundance of other spoil was captured. Decius,not choosing that the troops should be encumbered in their march withheavy baggage, ordered them to be called together, and said to them,""Do ye intend to rest satisfied with this single victory, and thisbooty? or do ye choose to cherish hopes proportioned to your bravery?All the cities of the Samnites, and the property left in them, areyour own; since, after so often defeating their legions, ye havefinally driven them out of the country. Sell those effects in yourhands; and allure traders, by a prospect of profit, to follow you onyour march. I will, from time to time, supply you with goods for sale.Let us go hence to the city of Romulea, where no greater labour, butgreater gain awaits you."" Having sold off the spoil, and warmlyadopting the general's plan, they proceeded to Romulea. There, also,without works or engines, as soon as the battalions approached, thesoldiers, deterred from the walls by no resistance, hastily applyingladders wherever was most convenient to each, they mounted thefortifications. The town was taken and plundered. Two thousand threehundred men were slain, six thousand taken prisoners, and the soldiersobtained abundance of spoil. This they were obliged to sell in likemanner as the former; and, though no rest was allowed them, theyproceeded, nevertheless, with the utmost alacrity to Ferentinum. Buthere they met a greater share both of difficulty and danger: thefortifications were defended with the utmost vigour, and the place wasstrongly fortified both by nature and art. However, the soldiers, nowinured to plunder, overcame every obstacle. Three thousand of theenemy were killed round the walls, and the spoil was given to thetroops. In some annals, the principal share of the honour of takingthese cities is attributed to Maximus. They say that Murgantia wastaken by Decius; Romulea and Ferentinum by Fabius. Some ascribe thishonour to the new consuls: others not to both, but to one of these,Lucius Volumnius: that to him the province of Samnium had fallen."Book 10,Chapter 18,"While things went on thus in Samnium, whoever it was that had thecommand and auspices, powerful combination, composed of many states,was formed in Etruria against the Romans, the chief promoter of whichwas Gellius Egnatius, a Samnite. Almost all the Etrurians had unitedin this war. The neighbouring states of Umbria were drawn in, as itwere, by the contagion; and auxiliaries were procured from the Gaulsfor hire: all their several numbers assembled at the camp of theSamnites. When intelligence of this sudden commotion was received atRome, after the consul, Lucius Volumnius, had already set out forSamnium, with the second and third legions, and fifteen thousand ofthe allies; it was, therefore, resolved, that Appius Claudius should,at the very earliest opportunity, go into Etruria. Two Roman legionsfollowed him, the first and fourth, and twelve thousand allies; theircamp was pitched at a small distance from the enemy. However,advantage was gained by his early arrival in this particular, that theawe of the Roman name kept in check some states of Etruria which weredisposed to war, rather than from any judicious or successfulenterprise achieved under the guidance of the consul. Several battleswere fought, at times and places unfavourable, and increasingconfidence rendered the enemy daily more formidable; so that matterscame nearly to such a state, as that neither could the soldiers relymuch on their leader, nor the leader on his soldiers. It appears inthree several histories, that a letter was sent by the consul to callhis colleague from Samnium. But I will not affirm what requiresstronger proof, as that point was a matter of dispute between thesetwo consuls of the Roman people, a second time associated in the sameoffice; Appius denying that the letter was sent, and Volumniusaffirming that he was called thither by a letter from Appius.Volumnius had, by this time, taken three forts in Samnium, in whichthree thousand of the enemy had been slain, and about half that numbermade prisoners; and, a sedition having been raised among the Lucaniansby the plebeians and the more indigent of the people, he had, to thegreat satisfaction of the nobles, quelled it by sending thitherQuintus Fabius, proconsul, with his own veteran army. He left toDecius the ravaging of the enemy's country; and proceeded with histroops into Etruria to his colleague; where, on his arrival, the wholearmy received him with joy. Appius, if he did not write the letter,being conscious of this, had, in my opinion, just ground ofdispleasure; but if he had actually stood in need of assistance, hisdisowning it, as he did, arose from an illiberal and ungrateful mind.For, on going out to receive him, when they had scarcely exchangedsalutations, he said, ""Is all well, Lucius Volumnius? How standaffairs in Samnium? What motive induced you to remove out of yourprovince?"" Volumnius answered, that ""affairs in Samnium were in aprosperous state; and that he had come thither in compliance with therequest in his letter. But, if that were a forged letter, and thatthere was no occasion for him in Etruria, he would instantly faceabout, and depart."" ""You may depart."" replied the other; ""no onedetains you: for it is a perfect inconsistency, that when, perhaps,you are scarcely equal to the management of your own war, you shouldvaunt of coming hither to succour others."" To this Volumnius rejoined,""May Hercules direct all for the best; for his part, he was betterpleased that he had taken useless trouble, than that any conjunctureshould have arisen which had made one consular army insufficient forEtruria."""Book 10,Chapter 19,"As the consuls were parting, the lieutenants-general and tribunesof Appius's army gathered round them. Some entreated their own generalthat he would not reject the voluntary offer of his colleague'sassistance, which ought to have been solicited in the first instance:the greater number used their endeavours to stop Volumnius, beseechinghim ""not, through a peevish dispute with his colleague, to abandon theinterest of the commonwealth; and represented to him, that in case anymisfortune should happen, the blame would fall on the person whoforsook the other, not on the one forsaken; that the state of affairswas such, that the credit and discredit of every success and failurein Etruria would be attributed to Lucius Volumnius: for no one wouldinquire, what were the words of Appius, but what the situation of thearmy. Appius indeed had dismissed him, but the commonwealth, and thearmy, required his stay. Let him only make trial of the inclinationsof the soldiers."" By such admonitions and entreaties they, in amanner, dragged the consuls, who almost resisted, to an assembly.There, longer discourses were made to the same purport, as had passedbefore in the presence of a few. And when Volumnius, who had theadvantage of the argument, showed himself not deficient in oratory, indespite of the extraordinary eloquence of his colleague; Appiusobserved with a sneer, that ""they ought to acknowledge themselvesindebted to him, in having a consul who possessed eloquence also,instead of being dumb and speechless, when in their former consulate,particularly during the first months, he was not able so much as toopen his lips; but now, in his harangues, even aspired afterpopularity."" Volumnius replied, ""How much more earnestly do I wish,that you had learned from me to act with spirit, than I from you tospeak with elegance: that now he made a final proposal, which woulddetermine, not which is the better orator, for that is not what thepublic wants, but which is the better commander. The provinces areEtruria and Samnium: that he might select which he preferred; that he,with his own army, will undertake to manage the business either inEtruria or in Samnium."" The soldiers then, with loud clamours,requested that they would, in conjunction, carry on the war inEtruria; when Volumnius perceiving that it was the general wish, said,""Since I have been mistaken in apprehending my colleague's meaning, Iwill take care that there shall be no room for mistake with respect tothe purport of your wishes. Signify by a shout whether you choose thatI should stay or depart."" On this, a shout was raised, so loud, thatit brought the enemy out of their camp: they snatched up their arms,and marched down in order of battle. Volumnius likewise ordered thesignal to be sounded, and the standard to be advanced from the camp.It is said that Appius hesitated, perceiving that, whether he foughtor remained inactive, his colleague would have the victory; and that,afterwards, dreading lest his own legions also should followVolumnius, he also gave the signal, at the earnest desire of his men.On neither side were the forces drawn up to advantage; for, on theone, Gellius Egnatius, the Samnite general, had gone out to foragewith a few cohorts, and his men entered on the fight as the violenceof their passions prompted, rather than under any directions ororders. On the other, the Roman armies neither marched out together,nor had time sufficient to form: Volumnius began to engage beforeAppius came up to the enemy, consequently the engagement commenced,their front in the battle being uneven; and by some accidentalinterchange of their usual opponents, the Etrurians fought againstVolumnius; and the Samnites, after delaying some time on account ofthe absence of their general, against Appius. We are told that Appius,during the heat of the fight, raising his hands toward heaven, so asto be seen in the foremost ranks, prayed thus, ""Bellona, if thougrantest us the victory this day, I vow to thee a temple."" And thatafter this vow, as if inspirited by the goddess, he displayed a degreeof courage equal to that of his colleague and of the troops. Thegenerals performed every duty, and each of their armies exerted, withemulation, its utmost vigour, lest victory should commence on theother side. They therefore routed and put to flight the enemy, whowere ill able to withstand a force so much superior to any with whichthey had been accustomed to contend: then pressing them as they gaveground, and pursuing them closely as they fled, they drove them intotheir camp. There, by the interposition of Gellius and his Samnitecohorts, the fight was renewed for a little time. But these beinglikewise soon dispersed, the camp was now stormed by the conquerors;and whilst Volumnius, in person, led his troops against one of thegates, Appius, frequently invoking Bellona the victorious, inflamedthe courage of his men, they broke in through the rampart andtrenches. The camp was taken and plundered, and an abundance of spoilwas found, and given up to the soldiers. Of the enemy seven thousandthree hundred were slain; and two thousand one hundred and twentytaken."Book 10,Chapter 20,"While both the consuls, with the whole force of the Romans,pointed their exertions principally against the war in Etruria, a newarmy which arose in Samnium, with design to ravage the frontiers ofthe Roman empire, passed over through the country of the Vescians,into the Campanian and Falernian territories, and committed greatdepredations. Volumnius, as he was hastening back to Samnium, byforced marches, because the term for which Fabius and Decius had beencontinued in command was nearly expired, heard of this army ofSamnites, and of the mischief which they had done in Campania;determining, therefore, to afford protection to the allies, he alteredhis route towards that quarter. When he arrived in the district ofGales, he found marks of their recent ravages; and the people of Galesinformed him that the enemy carried with them such a quantity ofspoil, that they could scarcely observe any order in their march: andthat the commanders then directed publicly that the troops should goimmediately to Samnium, and having deposited the booty there, thatthey should return to the business of the expedition, as they must notcommit to the hazard of an engagement an army so heavily laden.Notwithstanding that this account carried every appearance of truth,he yet thought it necessary to obtain more certain information;accordingly he despatched some horsemen, to seize on some of thestraggling marauders; from these he learned, on inquiry, that theenemy lay at the river Vulturnus; that they intended to remove thenceat the third watch; and that their route was towards Samnium. Onreceiving this intelligence, which could be depended upon, he set out,and sat down at such a distance from the enemy, that his approachcould not be discovered by his being too near them, and, at the sametime, that he might surprise them, as they should be coming out oftheir camp. A long time before day, he drew nigh to their post, andsent persons, who understood the Oscan language, to discover how theywere employed: these, mixing with the enemy, which they could easilydo during the confusion in the night, found that the standards hadgone out thinly attended; that the booty, and those appointed to guardit, were then setting out, a contemptible train; each busied about hisown affairs, without any concert with the rest, or much regard toorders. This was judged the fittest time for the attack, and daylightwas now approaching; he gave orders to sound the charge, and fell onthe enemy as they were marching out. The Samnites being embarrassedwith the spoil, and very few armed, some quickened their pace, anddrove the prey before them; others halted, deliberating whether itwould be safer to advance, or to return again to the camp; and whilethey hesitated, they were overtaken and cut off. The Romans had bythis time passed over the rampart, and filled the camp with slaughterand confusion: the Samnite army, in addition to the disorder caused bythe enemy, had their disorder increased by a sudden insurrection oftheir prisoners; some of whom, getting loose, set the rest at liberty,while others snatched the arms which were tied up among the baggage,and being intermixed with the troops, raised a tumult more terriblethan the battle itself. They then performed a memorable exploit: formaking an attack on Statius Minacius, the general, as he was passingbetween the ranks and encouraging his men; then, dispersing thehorsemen who attended him, they gathered round himself, and draggedhim, sitting on his horse, a prisoner to the Roman consul. By thismovement the foremost battalions of the Samnites were brought back,and the battle, which seemed to have been already decided, wasrenewed: but they could not support it long. Six thousand of them wereslain, and two thousand five hundred taken, among whom were fourmilitary tribunes, together with thirty standards, and, what gave theconquerors greater joy than all, seven thousand four hundred prisonerswere recovered. The spoil which had been taken from the allies wasimmense, and the owners were summoned by a proclamation, to claim andreceive then property. On the day appointed, all the effects, theowners of which did not appear, were given to the soldiers, who wereobliged to sell them, in order that they might have nothing to thinkof but their duty."Book 10,Chapter 21,"The depredations, committed on the lands of Campania, hadoccasioned a violent alarm at Rome, and it happened, that about thesame time intelligence was brought from Litruria, that, after thedeparture of Volumnius's army, all that country had risen up in arms,and that Gellius Egnatius, the leader of the Samnites, was causing theUmbrians to join in the insurrection, and tempting the Gauls with highoffers. Terrified at this news, the senate ordered the courts ofjustice to be shut, and a levy to be made of men of every description.Accordingly not only free-born men and the younger sort were obligedto enlist, but cohorts were formed of the elder citizens, and the sonsof freed-men were incorporated in the centuries. Plans were formed forthe defence of the city, and the praetor, Publius Sempronius, wasinvested with the chief command. However, the senate was exonerated ofone half of their anxiety, by a letter from the consul, LuciusVolumnius informing them that the army, which had ravaged Campania,had been defeated and dispersed whereupon, they decreed a publicthanksgiving for this success, in the name of the consul. The courtswere opened, after having been shut eighteen days, and thethanksgiving was performed with much joy. They then turned theirthoughts to devising measures for the future security of the countrydepopulated by the Samnites, and, with this view, it was resolved,that two colonies should be settled on the frontiers of the Vescianand Falernian territories, one at the mouth of the river Liris, whichhas received the name of Minturnae, the other in the Vescian forest,which borders on the Falernian territory, where, it is said, stoodSinope, a city of Grecians, called thenceforth by the Roman colonistsSinuessa. The plebeian tribunes were charged to procure an order ofthe commons, commanding Publius Sempronius, the praetor, to createtriumphs for conducting the colonies to those places. But persons werenot readily found to give in their names, because they considered thatthey were being sent into what was almost a perpetual advanced guardin a hostile country, not as a provision from concord between consuls,and the evils arising from their disagreement in the conduct ofmilitary affairs; at the same time remarking, ""how near the extremityof danger matters had been brought, by the late dispute between hiscolleague and himself."" He warmly recommended to Decius and Fabius to""live together with one mind and one spirit."" Observed that ""they weremen qualified by nature for military command: great in action, butunpractised in the strife of words and eloquence; their talents weresuch as eminently became consuls. As to the artful and the ingeniouslawyers and orators, such as Appius Claudius, they ought to be kept athome to preside in the city and the forum; and to be appointedpraetors for the administration of justice."" In these proceedings thatday was spent, and, on the following, the elections both of consulsand praetor were held, and were guided by the recommendationssuggested by the consul. Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius were chosenconsuls; Appius Claudius, praetor; all of them absent; and, by adecree of the senate, followed by an order of the commons, LuciusVolumnius was continued in the command for another year."Book 10,Chapter 22,Book 10,Chapter 23,"During that year many prodigies happened. For the purpose ofaverting which, the senate decreed a supplication for two days: thewine and frankincense for the sacrifices were furnished at the expenseof the public; and numerous crowds of men and women attended theperformance. This supplication was rendered remarkable by a quarrel,which broke out among the matrons in the chapel of patrician chastity,which stands in the cattle market, near the round temple of Hercules.Virginia, daughter of Aulus, a patrician, but married to Volumnius theconsul, a plebeian, was, because she had married out of thepatricians, excluded by the matrons from sharing in the sacred rites:a short altercation ensued, which was afterwards, through theintemperance of passion incident to the sex, kindled into a flame ofcontention. Virginia boasted with truth that she had a right to enterthe temple of patrician chastity, as being of patrician birth, andchaste in her character, and, besides, the wife of one husband, towhom she was betrothed a virgin, and had no reason to be dissatisfiedeither with her husband, or his exploits or honours: to herhigh-spirited words, she added importance by an extraordinary act. Inthe long street where she resided, she enclosed with a partition apart of the house, of a size sufficient for a small chapel, and thereerected an altar. Then calling together the plebeian matrons, andcomplaining of the injurious behaviour of the patrician ladies, shesaid, ""This altar I dedicate to plebeian chastity, and exhort you,that the same degree of emulation which prevails among the men of thisstate, on the point of valour, may be maintained by the women on thepoint of chastity; and that you contribute your best care, that thisaltar may have the credit of being attended with a greater degree ofsanctity, and by chaster women, than the other, if possible."" Solemnrites were performed at this altar under the same regulations, nearly,with those at the more ancient one; no person being allowed theprivilege of taking part in the sacrifices, except a woman of approvedchastity, and who was the wife of one husband. This institution, beingafterwards debased by [the admission of] vicious characters, and notonly by matrons, but women of every description, sunk at last intooblivion. During this year the Ogulnii, Cneius and Quintus, beingcurule aediles, carried on prosecutions against several usurers; whoseproperty being fined, out of the produce, which was deposited in thetreasury, they ordered brazen thresholds for the Capitol, utensils ofplate for three tables in the chapel of Jupiter, a statue of Jupiterin a chariot drawn by four horses placed on the roof, and images ofthe founders of the city in their infant state under the teats of thewolf, at the Ruminal fig-tree. They also paved with square stones theroads from the Capuan gate to the temple of Mars. By the plebeianaediles likewise, Lucius Aelius Paetus and Caius Fulvius Corvus, outof money levied as fines on farmers of the public pastures, whom theyhad convicted of malpractices, games were exhibited, and golden bowlswere placed in the temple of Ceres."Book 10,Chapter 24,"Then came into the consulship Quintus Fabius a fifth time, andPublius Decius a fourth. They had been colleagues from the censorship,and twice in the consulship, and were celebrated not more for theirglorious achievements, splendid as these were, than for the unanimitywhich had ever subsisted between them. The continuance of this feelingI am inclined to think was interrupted by a jarring between the[opposite] orders rather than between themselves, the patriciansendeavouring that Fabius should have Etruria for his province, withoutcasting lots, and the plebeians insisting that Decius should bring thematter to the decision of lots. There was certainly a contention inthe senate, and the interest of Fabius being superior there, thebusiness was brought before the people. Here, between military men wholaid greater stress on deeds than on words, the debate was short.Fabius said, ""that it was unreasonable, after he had planted a tree,another should gather the fruit of it. He had opened the Ciminianforest, and made a way for the Roman arms, through passes until thenimpracticable. Why had they disturbed him, at that time of his life,if they intended to give the management of the war to another?"" Then,in the way of a gentle reproof, he observed, that ""instead of anassociate in command, he had chosen an adversary; and that Deciusthought it too much that their unanimity should last through threeconsulates."" Declaring, in fine, that ""he desired nothing further,than that, if they thought him qualified for the command in theprovince, they should send him thither. He had submitted to thejudgment of the senate, and would now be governed by the authority ofthe people."" Publius Decius complained of injustice in the senate; andasserted, that ""the patricians had laboured, as long as possible, toexclude the plebeians from all access to the higher honours; and sincemerit, by its own intrinsic power, had prevailed so far, as that itshould not, in any rank of men, be precluded from the attainment ofhonours, expedients were sought how not only the suffrages of thepeople, but even the decisions of fortune may be rendered ineffectual,and be converted to the aggrandizement of a few. All the consulsbefore him had disposed of the provinces by lots; now, the senatebestowed a province on Fabius without lots. If this was meant as amark of honour, the merits of Fabius were so great towards thecommonwealth, and towards himself in particular, that he would gladlysecond the advancement of his reputation, provided only its splendourcould be increased without reflecting dishonour on himself. But whodid not see, that, when a war of difficulty and danger, and out of theordinary course, was committed to only that one consul, the otherwould be considered as useless and insignificant. Fabius gloried inhis exploits performed in Etruria: Publius Decius wished for a likesubject of glory, and perhaps would utterly extinguish that fire,which the other left smothered, in such a manner that it often brokeout anew, in sudden conflagrations. In fine, honours and rewards hewould concede to his colleague, out of respect to his age anddignified character: but when danger, when a vigorous struggle with anenemy was before them, he never did, nor ever would, willingly, giveplace. With respect to the present dispute, this much he would gain atall events, that a business, appertaining to the jurisdiction of thepeople, should be determined by an order of that people, and notcomplimented away by the senate. He prayed Jupiter, supremely good andgreat, and all the immortal gods, not to grant him an equal chancewith his colleague, unless they intended to grant him equal abilityand success, in the management of the war. It was certainly in itsnature reasonable, in the example salutary, and concerned thereputation of the Roman people, that the consuls should be men of suchabilities, that under either of them a war with Etruria could be wellmanaged."" Fabius, after requesting of the people nothing else thanthat, before the tribes were called in to give their votes, they wouldhear the letters of the praetor Appius Claudius, written from Etruria,withdrew from the Comitium, and with no less unanimity of the peoplethan of the senate, the province of Etruria was decreed to him withouthaving recourse to lots."Book 10,Chapter 25,"Immediately almost all the younger citizens flocked together tothe consul, and readily gave in their names; so strong was theirdesire of serving under such a commander. Seeing so great a multitudecollected round him, he said, ""My intention is to enlist only fourthousand foot and six hundred horse: such of you as give in your namesto-day and to-morrow, I will carry with me. I am more solicitous tobring home all my soldiers rich, than to employ a great multitude.""Accordingly, with a competent number of men, who possessed greaterhopes and confidence because a numerous army had not been required, hemarched to the town of Aharna, from which the enemy were not fardistant, and proceeded to the camp of the praetor Appius. When withina few miles of it, he was met by some soldiers, sent to cut wood,attended by a guard. Observing the lictors preceding him, and learningthat he was Fabius the consul, they were filled with joy and alacrity;they expressed their thanks to the gods, and to the Roman people, forhaving sent them such a commander. Then as they gathered round to paytheir respects, Fabius inquired whither they were going, and on theiranswering they were going to provide wood, ""What do you tell me,"" saidhe, ""have you not a rampart, raised about your camp?"" When to thisthey replied, ""they had a double rampart, and a trench, and,notwithstanding, were in great apprehension.""""Well then,"" said he, ""you have abundance of wood, go back and levelthe rampart."" They accordingly returned to the camp and therelevelling the rampart threw the soldiers who had remained in it, andAppius himself, into the greatest fright, until with eager joy eachcalled out to the rest, that, ""they acted by order of the consul,Quintus Fabius."" Next day the camp was moved from thence, and thepraetor, Appius, was dismissed to Rome. From that time the Romans hadno fixed post, the consul affirming, that it was prejudicial to anarmy to lie in one spot, and that by frequent marches, and changingplaces, it was rendered more healthy, and more capable of briskexertions, and marches were made as long as the winter, which was notyet ended, permitted. Then, in the beginning of spring, leaving thesecond legion near Clusium, which they formerly called the Camertian,and giving the command of the camp to Lucius Scipio, as propraetor, hereturned to Rome, in order to adjust measures for carrying on the war,either led thereto by his own judgment, because the war seemed to himmore serious than he had believed, from report, or, being summoned bya decree of the senate, for writers give both accounts. Some choose tohave it believed, that he was forced back by the praetor, AppiusClaudius, who, both in the senate, and before the people, exaggerated,as he was wont in all his letters, the danger of the Etrurian war,contending, that ""one general, or one army, would not be sufficient tooppose four nations. That whether these directed the whole of theircombined force against him alone, or acted separately in differentparts, there was reason to fear, that he would be unable to provideagainst every emergency. That he had left there but two Roman legions;and that the foot and horse, who came with Fabius, did not amount tofive thousand. It was, therefore, his opinion, that the consul,Publius Decius should, without delay, set out to his colleague inEtruria, and that the province of Samnium should be given to LuciusVolumnius. But if the consul preferred going to his own province, thatthen Volumnius should march a full consular army into Etruria, to jointhe other consul."" When the advice of the praetor influenced a greatpart of the members, they say that Publius Decius recommended thatevery thing should be kept undetermined, and open for Quintus Fabius;until he should either come to Rome, if he could do so withoutprejudice to the public, or send some of his lieutenants, from whomthe senate might learn the real state of the war in Etruria; and withwhat number of troops, and by how many generals, it should be carriedon."Book 10,Chapter 26,"Fabius, as soon as he returned to Rome, qualified his discourses,both in the senate and when brought before the people, in such amanner as to appear neither to exaggerate or lessen, any particularrelating to the war; and to show, that, in agreeing to another generalbeing joined with him, he rather indulged the apprehensions of others,than guarded against any danger to himself, or the public. ""But ifthey chose,"" he said, ""to give him an assistant in the war, andassociate in command, how could he overlook Publius Decius the consul,whom he had tried during so many associations in office? There was noman living whom he would rather wish to be joined in commission withhim: with Publius Decius he should have forces sufficient, and nevertoo many enemies. If, however, his colleague preferred any otheremployment, let them then give him Lucius Volumnius as an assistant.""The disposal of every particular was left entirely to Fabius by thepeople and the senate, and even by his colleague. And when Deciusdeclared that he was ready to go either to Etruria or Samnium, suchgeneral congratulation and satisfaction took place, that victory wasanticipated, and it seemed as if a triumph, not a war, had beendecreed to the consuls. I find in some writers, that Fabius andDecius, immediately on their entering into office, set out togetherfor Etruria, without any mention of the casting of lots for theprovinces, or of the disputes which I have related. Others, notsatisfied with relating those disputes, have added charges ofmisconduct, laid by Appius before the people against Fabius, whenabsent; and a stubborn opposition, maintained by the praetor againstthe consul, when present; and also another contention between thecolleagues, Decius insisting that each consul should attend to thecare of his own separate province. Certainty, however, begins toappear from the time when both consuls set out for the campaign. Now,before the consuls arrived in Etruria, the Senonian Gauls came in avast body to Clusium, to attack the Roman legion and the camp. Scipio,who commanded the camp, wishing to remedy the deficiency of hisnumbers by an advantage in the ground, led his men up a hill, whichstood between the camp and the city but having, in his haste,neglected to examine the place, he reached near the summit, which hefound already possessed by the enemy, who had ascended on the otherside. The legion was consequently attacked on the rear, and surroundedin the middle, when the enemy pressed it on all sides. Some writerssay, that the whole were cut off, so that not one survived to give anaccount of it, and that no information of the misfortune reached theconsuls, who were, at the time, not far from Clusium, until the Gallichorsemen came within sight, carrying the heads of the slain, somehanging before their horses' breasts, others on the points of theirspears, and expressing their triumph in songs according to theircustom. Others affirm, that the defeat was by Umbrians, not Gauls, andthat the loss sustained was not so great. That a party of foragers,under Lucius Manlius Torquatus, lieutenant-general, being surrounded,Scipio, the propraetor, brought up relief from the camp, and thebattle being renewed, that the Umbrians, lately victorious, weredefeated, and the prisoners and spoil retaken. But it is more probablethat this blow was suffered from a Gallic than an Umbrian enemy,because during that year, as was often the case at other times, thedanger principally apprehended by the public, was that of a Gallictumult, for which reason, notwithstanding that both the consuls hadmarched against the enemy, with four legions, and a large body ofRoman cavalry, joined by a thousand chosen horsemen of Campania,supplied on the occasion, and a body of the allies and Latinconfederates, superior in number to the Romans, two other armies wereposted near the city, on the side facing Etruria, one in theFaliscian, the other in the Vatican territory. Cneius Fulvius andLucius Postumius Megellus, both propraetors, were ordered to keep thetroops stationed in those places."Book 10,Chapter 27,"The consuls, having crossed the Apennines, came up with the enemyin the territory of Sentinum, their camp was pitched there at thedistance of about four miles. Several councils were then held by theenemy, and their plan of operations was thus settled: that they shouldnot encamp together, nor go out together to battle; the Gauls wereunited to the Samnites, the Umbrians to the Etrurians. The day ofbattle was fixed. The part of maintaining the fight was committed tothe Samnites and Gauls; and the Etrurians and Umbrians were ordered toattack the Roman camp during the heat of the engagement. This plan wasfrustrated by three Clusian deserters, who came over by night toFabius, and after disclosing the above designs, were sent back withpresents, in order that they might discover, and bring intelligenceof, any new scheme which should be determined on. The consuls thenwrote to Flavius and Postumius to move their armies, the one from theFaliscian, the other from the Vatican country, towards Clusium; and toruin the enemy's territory by every means in their power. The news ofthese depredations drew the Etrurians from Sentinum to protect theirown region. The consuls, in their absence, practised every means tobring on an engagement. For two days they endeavoured, by severalattacks, to provoke the enemy to fight; in which time, however,nothing worth mention was performed. A few fell on each side, butstill the minds [of the Romans] were irritated to wish for a generalengagement; yet nothing decisive was hazarded. On the third day, bothparties marched out their whole force to the field: here, while thearmies stood in order of battle, a hind, chased by a wolf from themountains, ran through the plain between the two lines: there theanimals taking different directions, the hind bent its course towardsthe Gauls, the wolf towards the Romans: way was made between the ranksfor the wolf, the Gauls slew the hind with their javelins; on whichone of the Roman soldiers in the van said, ""To that side, where yousee an animal, sacred to Diana, lying prostrate, flight and slaughterare directed; on this side the victorious wolf of Mars, safe anduntouched, reminds us of our founder, and of our descent from thatdeity."" The Gauls were posted on the right wing, the Samnites on theleft: against the latter, Fabius drew up, as his right wing, the firstand third legions: against the Gauls, Decius formed the left wing ofthe fifth and sixth. The second and fourth were employed in the war inSamnium, under the proconsul, Lucius Volumnius. In the first encounterthe action was supported with strength so equal on both sides, thathad the Etrurians and Umbrians been present, either in the field or atthe camp, in whichever place they might have employed their force, theRomans must have been defeated."Book 10,Chapter 28,"However, although the victory was still undecided, fortune nothaving declared in favour of either party, yet the course of the fightwas by no means similar on both right and left wings. The Romans,under Fabius, rather repelled than offered assault, and the contestwas protracted until very late in the day, for their general knew verywell, that both Samnites and Gauls were furious in the first onset, sothat, to withstand them would be sufficient. It was known, too, thatin a protracted contest the spirits of the Samnites gradually flagged,and even the bodies of the Gauls, remarkably ill able to bear labourand heat, became quite relaxed, and although, in their first efforts,they were more than men, yet in their last they were less than women.He, therefore, reserved the strength of his men as unimpaired aspossible, until the time when the enemy were the more likely to beworsted. Decius, more impetuous, as being in the prime of life andfull flow of spirits, exerted whatever force he had to the utmost inthe first encounter, and thinking the infantry not sufficientlyenergetic, brought up the cavalry to the fight. Putting himself at thehead of a troop of young horsemen of distinguished bravery, hebesought those youths, the flower of the army, to charge the enemywith him, [telling them] ""they would reap a double share of glory, ifthe victory should commence on the left wing, and through theirmeans."" Twice they compelled the Gallic cavalry to give way. At thesecond charge, when they advanced farther and were briskly engaged inthe midst of the enemy's squadrons, by a method of fighting new tothem, they were thrown into dismay. A number of the enemy, mounted onchariots and cars, made towards them with such a prodigious clatterfrom the trampling of the cattle and rolling of wheels, as affrightedthe horses of the Romans, unaccustomed to such tumultuous operations.By this means the victorious cavalry were dispersed, through a panic,and men and horses, in their headlong flight, were tumbledpromiscuously on the ground. Hence also the battalions of the legionswere thrown into disorder, through the impetuosity of the horses, andof the carriages which they dragged through the ranks, many of thesoldiers in the van were trodden or bruised to death, while the Gallicline, as soon as they saw their enemy in confusion, pursued theadvantage, nor allowed them time to take breath or recover themselves.Decius, calling aloud, ""Whither were they flying, or what hope couldthey have in running away?"" strove to stop them as they turned theirbacks, but finding that he could not, by any efforts, prevail on themto keep their posts, so thoroughly were they dismayed, he called onhis father, Publius Decius, by name. He said, ""Why do I any longerdefer the fate entailed on my family? It is destined to our race, thatwe should serve as expiatory victims to avert the public danger. Iwill now offer the legions of the enemy, together with myself, to beimmolated to Earth, and the infernal gods."" Having thus said, hecommanded Marcus Livius, a pontiff, whom, at his coming out to thefield, he had charged not to stir from him, to dictate the form ofwords in which he was to devote himself, and the legions of the enemy,for the army of the Roman people, the Quirites. He was accordinglydevoted with the same imprecations, and in the same habit, in whichhis father, Publius Decius, had ordered himself to be devoted at theVeseris in the Latin war. When, immediately after the solemnimprecation, he added, that ""he drove before him dismay and flight,slaughter and blood, and the wrath of the gods celestial and infernal,that, with the contagious influence of the furies, the ministers ofdeath, he would infect the standards, the weapons, and the armour ofthe enemy, and that the same spot should be that of his perdition, andthat of the Gauls and Samnites."" After uttering these execrations onhimself and the foe, he spurred forward his horse, where he saw theline of the Gauls thickest, and, rushing upon the enemy's weapons, methis death."Book 10,Chapter 29,"Thenceforward the battle seemed to be fought with a degree offorce scarcely human. The Romans, on the loss of their general, acircumstance which, on other occasions, is wont to inspire terror,stopped their flight, and were anxious to begin the combat afresh. TheGauls, and especially the multitude which encircled the consul's body,as if deprived of reason, cast their javelins at random withoutexecution, some became so stupid as not to think of either fighting orflying, while on the other side, Livius, the pontiff, to whom Deciushad transferred his lictors, with orders to act as propraetor, criedout aloud, that ""the Romans were victorious, being saved by the deathof their consul. That the Gauls and Samnites were now the victims ofmother Earth and the infernal gods. That Decius was summoning anddragging to himself the army devoted along with him, and that, amongthe enemy, all was full of dismay, and the vengeance of all thefuries."" While the soldiers were busy in restoring the fight, LuciusCornelius Scipio and Caius Marcius, with some reserved troops from therear, who had been sent by Quintus Fabius, the consul, to the supportof his colleague, came up. There the fate of Decius is ascertained, apowerful stimulus to brave every danger in the cause of the public.Wherefore, when the Gauls stood in close order, with their shieldsformed into a fence before them, and but little prospect of successappeared from a close fight, the javelins, which lay scattered betweenthe two lines, were, therefore, by order of the lieutenants-general,gathered up from the ground, and thrown against the enemy's shields,and as most of them pierced the fence, the long pointed ones even intotheir bodies, their compact band was overthrown in such a manner, thata great many, who were unhurt, yet fell as if thunderstruck. Such werethe changes of fortune on the left wing of the Romans; on the right,Fabius had at first protracted the time, as we mentioned above, inslow operations, then, as soon as he perceived that neither the shout,nor the efforts of the enemy, nor the weapons which they threw,retained their former force, having ordered the commanders of thecavalry to lead round their squadrons to the flank of the Samnites, sothat, on receiving the signal, they should charge them in flank, withall possible violence, he commanded, at the same time, his infantry toadvance leisurely, and drive the enemy from their ground. When he sawthat they were unable to make resistance, and that their exhaustionwas certain, drawing together all his reserves, whom he had kept freshfor that occasion, he made a brisk push with the legions, and gave thecavalry the signal to charge. The Samnites could not support theshock, but fled precipitately to their camp, passing by the line ofthe Gauls, and leaving their allies to fight by themselves. Thesestood in close order under cover of their shields. Fabius, therefore,having heard of the death of his colleague, ordered the squadron ofCampanian cavalry, in number about five hundred, to fall back from theranks, and riding round, to attack the rear of the Gallic line, thenthe chief strength of the third legion to follow, with directions thatwherever they should see the enemy's troops disordered by the charge,to follow the blow, and cut them to pieces, when in a state ofconsternation. After vowing a temple and the spoils of the enemy toJupiter the Victorious, he proceeded to the camp of the Samnites,whither all their forces were hurrying in confusion. The gates notaffording entrance to such very great numbers, those who werenecessarily excluded, attempted resistance just at the foot of therampart, and here fell Gellius Egnatius, the Samnite general. These,however, were soon driven within the rampart; the camp was taken aftera slight resistance; and at the same time the Gauls were attacked onthe rear, and overpowered. There were slain of the enemy on that daytwenty-five thousand: eight thousand were taken prisoners. Nor was thevictory an unbloody one; for, of the army of Publius Decius, thekilled amounted to seven thousand; of the army of Fabius, to onethousand two hundred. Fabius, after sending persons to search for thebody of his colleague, had the spoils of the enemy collected into aheap, and burned them as an offering to Jupiter the Victorious. Theconsul's body could not be found that day, being hid under a heap ofslaughtered Gauls: on the following, it was discovered and brought tothe camp, amidst abundance of tears shed by the soldiers. Fabius,discarding all concern about any other business, solemnized theobsequies of his colleague in the most honourable manner, passing onhim the high encomiums which he had justly merited."Book 10,Chapter 30,"During the same period, matters were managed successfully byCneius Fulvius, propraetor, he having, besides the immense lossesoccasioned to the enemy by the devastation of their lands, fought abattle with extraordinary success, in which there were above threethousand of the Perusians and Clusians slain, and twenty militarystandards taken. The Samnites, in their flight, passing through thePelignian territory, were attacked on all sides by the Pelignians;and, out of five thousand, one thousand were killed. The glory of theday on which they fought at Sentinum was great, even when trulyestimated; but some have gone beyond credibility by theirexaggerations, who assert in their writings, that there were in thearmy of the enemy forty thousand three hundred and thirty foot, sixthousand horse, and one thousand chariots, that is, including theEtrurians and Umbrians, who [they affirm] were present in theengagement: and, to magnify likewise the number of Roman forces, theyadd to the consuls another general, Lucius Volumnius, proconsul, andhis army to the legions of the consul. In the greater number ofannals, that victory is ascribed entirely to the two consuls.Volumnius was employed in the mean time in Samnium; he drove the armyof the Samnites to Mount Tifernus, and, not deterred by the difficultyof the ground, routed and dispersed them. Quintus Fabius, leavingDecius's army in Etruria, and leading off his own legions to the city,triumphed over the Gauls, Etrurians, and Samnites: the soldiersattended him in his triumph. The victory of Quintus Fabius was notmore highly celebrated, in their coarse military verses, than theillustrious death of Publius Decius; and the memory of the father wasrecalled, whose fame had been equalled by the praiseworthy conduct ofthe son, in respect of the issue which resulted both to himself and tothe public. Out of the spoil, donations were made to the soldiers ofeighty-two _asses_ [Footnote: _5s. 31d._] to each, withcloaks and vests; rewards for service, in that age, by no meanscontemptible."Book 10,Chapter 31,"Notwithstanding these successes, peace was not yet established,either among the Samnites or Etrurians: for the latter, at theinstigation of the Perusians, resumed their arms, after his army hadbeen withdrawn by the consul; and the Samnites made predatoryincursions on the territories of Vescia and Formiae; and also on theother side, on those of Aesernia, and the parts adjacent to the riverVulturnus. Against these was sent the praetor Appius Claudius, withthe army formerly commanded by Decius. In Etruria, Fabius, on therevival of hostilities, slew four thousand five hundred of thePerusians, and took prisoners one thousand seven hundred and forty,who were ransomed at the rate of three hundred and ten _asses_[Footnote: £1.] each. All the rest of the spoil was bestowed on thesoldiers. The legions of the Samnites, though pursued, some by thepraetor Appius Claudius, the others by Lucius Volumnius, proconsul,formed a junction in the country of the Stellatians. Here sat down thewhole body of the Samnites; and Appius and Volumnius, with theirforces united in one camp. A battle was fought with the most rancorousanimosity, one party being spurred on by rage against men who had sooften renewed their attacks on them, and the other now fighting insupport of their last remaining hope. Accordingly, there were slain,of the Samnites, sixteen thousand three hundred, and two thousand andseven hundred made prisoners: of the Roman army fell two thousand andseven hundred. This year, so successful in the operations of war, wasfilled with distress at home, arising from a pestilence, and withanxiety, occasioned by prodigies: for accounts were received that, inmany places, showers of earth had fallen; and that very many persons,in the army of Appius Claudius, had been struck by lightning; inconsequence of which, the books were consulted. At this time, QuintusFabius Gurges, the consul's son, having prosecuted some matrons beforethe people on a charge of adultery, built, with the money accruingfrom the fines which they were condemned to pay, the temple of Venus,which stands near the circus. Still we have the wars of the Samniteson our hands, notwithstanding that the relation of them has alreadyextended, in one continued course, through four volumes of ourhistory, and through a period of forty-six years, from the consulateof Marcus Valerius and Aulus Cornelius, who first carried the Romanarms into Samnium. And, not to recite the long train of disasterssustained by both nations, and the toils which they underwent, bywhich, however, their stubborn breasts could not be subdued; even inthe course of the last year, the Samnites, with their own forcesseparately, and also in conjunction with those of other nations, hadbeen defeated by four several armies, and four generals of the Romans,in the territory of Sentinum, in that of the Pelignians, at Tifernum,and in the plains of the Stellatians; had lost the general of thehighest character in their nation; and, now, saw their allies in thewar, the Etrurians, the Umbrians, and the Gauls, in the same situationwith themselves; but, although they could now no longer stand, eitherby their own or by foreign resources, yet did they not desist from theprosecution of hostilities. So far were they from being weary ofdefending liberty, even though unsuccessfully: and they preferredbeing defeated to not aspiring after victory. Who does not find hispatience tired, either in writing, or reading, of wars of suchcontinuance; and which yet exhausted not the resolution of the partiesconcerned?"Book 10,Chapter 32,"Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius were succeeded in the consulshipby Lucius Postumius Megellus and Marcus Atilius Regulus. The provinceof Samnium was decreed to both in conjunction; because intelligencehad been received that the enemy had embodied three armies; with onethat Etruria was to be recovered; with another the ravages in Campaniawere to be repeated; and the third was intended for the defence oftheir frontiers. Sickness detained Postumius at Rome, but Atilius setout immediately, with design to surprise the enemy in Samnium, beforethey should have advanced beyond their own borders; for such had beenthe directions of the senate. The Romans met the enemy, as if bymutual appointment, at a spot where, while they could be hindered, notonly from ravaging, but even from entering the Samnite territory, theycould likewise hinder the Samnites from continuing their progress intothe countries which were quiet, and the lands of the allies of theRoman people. While their camps lay opposite to each other, theSamnites attempted an enterprise, which the Romans, so often theirconquerors, would scarcely have ventured to undertake; such is therashness inspired by extreme despair: this was to make an assault onthe Roman camp. And although this attempt, so daring, succeeded not inits full extent, yet it was not without effect. There was a fog, whichcontinued through a great part of the day, so thick as to exclude thelight of the sun, and to prevent not only the view of any thing beyondthe rampart, but scarcely the sight of each other, when they shouldmeet. Depending on this, as a covering to the design, when the sun wasscarcely yet risen, and the light which he did afford was obscured bythe fog, the Samnites came up to an advanced guard of the Romans atone of the gates, who were standing carelessly on their post. In thesudden surprise, these had neither courage nor strength to makeresistance: an assault was then made, through the Decuman gate, in therear of the camp: the quaestor's quarters in consequence were taken,and the quaestor, Lucius Opimius Pansa, was there slain; on this ageneral alarm was given to take up arms."Book 10,Chapter 33,"The consul, being roused by the tumult, ordered two cohorts of theallies, a Lucanian and Suessanian, which happened to be nearest, todefend the head-quarters, and led the companies of the legions downthe principal street. These ran into the ranks, scarcely taking timeto furnish themselves with arms; and, as they distinguished the enemyby their shout rather than by sight, could form no judgment how greattheir number might be: thus, ignorant of the circumstances of theirsituation, they at first drew back, and admitted the enemy into theheart of the camp. Then when the consul cried out, asking them,whether they intended to let themselves be beaten out beyond therampart, and then to return again to storm their own camp, they raisedthe shout, and uniting their efforts, stood their ground; then madeadvances, pushed closely on the enemy, and having forced them to giveway, drove them back, without suffering their first terror to abate.They soon beat them out beyond the gate and the rampart, but notdaring to pursue them, because the darkness of the weather made themapprehend an ambush, and content with having cleared the camp, theyretired within the rampart, having killed about three hundred of theenemy. Of the Romans, including the first advanced guard and thewatchmen, and those who were surprised at the quaestor's quarters, twohundred and thirty perished. This not unsuccessful piece of boldnessraised the spirits of the Samnites so high, that they not only did notsuffer the Romans to march forward into their country, but even toprocure forage from their lands; and the foragers were obliged to goback into the quiet country of Sora. News of these events beingconveyed to Rome, with circumstances of alarm magnified beyond thetruth, obliged Lucius Postumius, the consul, though scarcely recoveredfrom his illness, to set out for the army. However, before hisdeparture, having issued a proclamation that his troops shouldassemble at Sora, he dedicated the temple of Victory, for the buildingof which he had provided, when curule aedile, out of the money arisingfrom fines; and, joining the army, he advanced from Sora towardsSamnium, to the camp of his colleague. The Samnites, despairing ofbeing able to make head against the two armies, retreated from thence,on which the consuls, separating, proceeded by different routes to laywaste the enemy's lands and besiege their towns."Book 10,Chapter 34,"Postumius attempted to make himself master of Milionia, at firstby storm and an assault; but these not succeeding, he carried hisapproaches to the walls, and thus gained an entrance into the place.The fight was continued in all parts of the city from the fourth houruntil near the eighth, the result being a long time uncertain: theRomans at last gained possession of the town. Three thousand twohundred of the Samnites were killed, four thousand seven hundredtaken, besides the other booty. From thence the legions were conductedto Ferentinum, out of which the inhabitants had, during the night,retired in silence through the opposite gate, with all their effectswhich could be either carried or driven. The consul, on his arrival,approached the walls with the same order and circumspection, as if hewere to meet an opposition here equal to what he had experienced atMilionia. Then, perceiving a dead silence in the city, and neitherarms nor men on the towers and ramparts, he restrains the soldiers,who were eager to mount the deserted fortifications, lest they mightfall into a snare. He ordered two divisions of the confederate Latinhorse to ride round the walls, and explore every particular. Thesehorsemen observed one gate, and, at a little distance, another on thesame side, standing wide open, and on the roads leading from theseevery mark of the enemy having fled by night. They then rode upleisurely to the gates, from whence, with perfect safety, they took aclear view through straight streets quite across the city. They reportto the consul, that the city was abandoned by the enemy, as was plainfrom the solitude, the recent tracks on their retreat, and the thingswhich, in the confusion of the night, they had left scattered up anddown. On hearing this, the consul led round the army to that side ofthe city which had been examined, and making the troops halt at alittle distance from the gate, gave orders that five horsemen shouldride into the city; and when they should have advanced a good way intoit, then, if they saw all things safe, three should remain there, andthe other two return to him with intelligence. These returned andsaid, that they had proceeded to a part of the town from which theyhad a view on every side, and that nothing but silence and solitudereigned through the whole extent of it. The consul immediately ledsome light-armed cohorts into the city; ordering the rest to fortifya camp in the mean time. The soldiers who entered the town, breakingopen the doors, found only a few persons, disabled by age or sickness;and such effects left behind as could not, without difficulty, beremoved. These were seized as plunder: and it was discovered from theprisoners, that several cities in that quarter had, in pursuance of aconcerted plan, resolved on flight; that their towns-people had goneoff at the first watch, and they believed that the same solitude theyshould find in the other places. The accounts of the prisoners provedwell-founded, and the consul took possession of the forsaken towns."Book 10,Chapter 35,"The war was by no means so easy with the other consul, MarcusAtilius. As he was marching his legions towards Luceria, to which hewas informed that the Samnites had laid siege, the enemy met him onthe border of the Lucerian territory. Rage supplied them, on thisoccasion, with strength to equal his: the battle was stubbornlycontested, and the victory doubtful; in the issue, however, morecalamitous on the side of the Romans, both because they wereunaccustomed to defeat, and that, on leaving the field, they felt moresensibly, than during the heat of the action, how much more wounds andbloodshed had been on their side. In consequence of this, such dismayspread through the camp, as, had it seized them during the engagement,a signal defeat would have been the result. Even as the matter stood,they spent the night in great anxiety; expecting, every instant, thatthe Samnites would assault the camp; or that, at the first light, theyshould be obliged to stand a battle with a victorious enemy. On theside of the enemy, however, although there was less loss, yet therewas not greater courage. As soon as day appeared, they wished toretire without any more fighting; but there was only one road, andthat leading close by the post of their enemy; on their taking which,they seemed as if advancing directly to attack the camp. The consul,therefore, ordered his men to take arms, and to follow him outside therampart, giving directions to the lieutenants-general, tribunes, andthe praefects of the allies, in what manner he would have each of themact. They all assured him that ""they would do every thing in theirpower, but that the soldiers were quite dejected; that, from their ownwounds, and the groans of the dying, they had passed the whole nightwithout sleep; that if the enemy had approached the camp before day,so great were the fears of the troops, that they would certainly havedeserted their standards."" ""Even at present they were restrained fromflight merely by shame; and, in other respects, were little betterthan vanquished men."" This account made the consul judge it necessaryto go himself among the soldiers, and speak to them; and, as he cameup to each, he rebuked them for their backwardness in taking arms,asking, ""Why they loitered, and declined the fight? If they did notchoose to go out of the camp, the enemy would come into it; and theymust fight in defence of their tents, if they would not in defence ofthe rampart. Men who have arms in their hands, and contend with theirfoe, have always a chance for victory; but the man who waits naked andunarmed for his enemy, must suffer either death or slavery."" To thesereprimands and rebukes they answered, that ""they were exhausted by thefatigue of the battle of yesterday; and had no strength, nor evenblood remaining; and besides, the enemy appeared more numerous thanthey were the day before."" The hostile army, in the mean time, drewnear; so that, seeing every thing more distinctly as the distance grewless, they asserted that the Samnites carried with them pallisades fora rampart, and evidently intended to draw lines of circumvallationround the camp. On this the consul exclaimed, with great earnestness,against submitting to such an ignominious insult, and from sodastardly a foe. ""Shall we even be blockaded,"" said he, ""in our camp,and die, with ignominy, by famine, rather than bravely by the sword,if it must be so? May the gods be propitious! and let every one act inthe manner which he thinks becomes him. The consul Marcus Atilius,should no other accompany him, will go out, even alone, to face theenemy; and will fall in the middle of the Samnite battalions, ratherthan see the Roman camp enclosed by their trenches."" Thelieutenants-general, tribunes, every troop of the cavalry, and theprincipal centurions, expressed their approbation of what the consulsaid; and the soldiers at length, overcome by shame, took up theirarms, but in a spiritless manner; and in the same spiritless manner,marched out of the camp. In a long train, and that not every whereconnected, melancholy, and seemingly subdued, they proceeded towardsthe enemy, whose hopes and courage, were not more steady than theirs.As soon therefore as the Roman standards were beheld, a murmur spreadfrom front to rear of the Samnites, that, as they had feared, ""theRomans were coming out to oppose their march; that there was no roadopen, through which they could even fly thence; in that spot they mustfall, or else cut down the enemy's ranks, and make their way overtheir bodies."""Book 10,Chapter 36,"They then threw the baggage in a heap in the centre, and, withtheir arms prepared for battle, formed their line, each falling intohis post. There was now but a small interval between the two armies,and both stood, waiting until the shout and onset should be begun bytheir adversary. Neither party had any inclination to fight, and theywould have separated, and taken different roads, unhurt and untouched,but that each had a dread of being harassed, in retreat, by the other.Notwithstanding this shyness and reluctance, an engagement unavoidablybegan, but spiritless, and with a shout which discovered neitherresolution nor steadiness; nor did any move a foot from his post. TheRoman consul, then, in order to infuse life into the action, ordered afew troops of cavalry to advance out of the line and charge: most ofwhom being thrown from their horses and the rest put in disorder,several parties ran forward, both from the Samnite line, to cut offthose who had fallen, and from the Roman, to protect their friends. Inconsequence the battle became a little more brisk, but the Samniteshad come forward with more briskness, and also in greater numbers, andthe disordered cavalry, with their affrighted horses, trod down theirown party who came to their relief. Flight commencing in this quarter,caused the whole Roman line to turn their backs. And now the Samniteshad no employment for their arms but against the rear of a flyingenemy, when the consul, galloping on before his men to the gate of thecamp, posted there a body of cavalry, with orders to treat as an enemyany person who should make towards the rampart, whether Roman orSamnite; and, placing himself in the way of his men, as they pressedin disorder towards the camp, denounced threats to the same purport:""Whither are you going, soldiers?"" said he; ""here also you will findboth men and arms; nor, while your consul lives, shall you pass therampart, unless victorious. Choose therefore which you will prefer,fighting against your own countrymen, or the enemy."" While the consulwas thus speaking the cavalry gathered round, with the points of theirspears presented, and ordered the infantry to return to the fight. Notonly his own brave spirit, but fortune likewise aided the consul, forthe Samnites did not push their advantage; so that he had time towheel round his battalions, and to change his front from the camptowards the enemy. The men then began to encourage each other toreturn to the battle, while the centurions snatched the ensigns fromthe standard-bearers and bore them forward, pointing out to thesoldiers the enemy, coming on in a hurry, few in number, and withtheir ranks disordered. At the same time the consul, with his handslifted up towards heaven, and raising his voice so as to be heard at adistance, vowed a temple to Jupiter Stator, if the Roman army shouldrally from flight, and, renewing the battle, cut down and defeat theSamnites. All divisions of the army, now, united their efforts torestore the fight; officers, soldiers, the whole force, both ofcavalry and infantry; even the powers of heaven seemed to have looked,with favour, on the Roman cause; so speedily was a thorough changeeffected in the fortune of the day, the enemy being repulsed from thecamp, and, in a short time, driven back to the spot where the battlehad commenced. Here they stopped, being obstructed by the heap ofbaggage, lying in their way, where they had thrown it together; andthen, to prevent the plundering of their effects, formed round them acircle of troops. On this, the infantry assailed them vigorously infront, while the cavalry, wheeling, fell on their rear: and, beingthus enclosed between the two, they were all either slain, or takenprisoners. The number of the prisoners was seven thousand two hundred,who were all sent under the yoke; the killed amounted to four thousandeight hundred. The victory did not prove a joyous one, even on theside of the Romans: when the consul took an account of the losssustained in the two days, the number returned, of soldiers lost, wasseven thousand three hundred. During these transactions in Apulia, theSamnites with the other army having attempted to seize on Iteramna, aRoman colony situated on the Latin road, did not however obtain thetown; whence, after ravaging the country, as they were driving offspoil, consisting of men and cattle, together with the colonists whomthey had taken, they met the consul returning victorious from Luceria,and not only lost their booty, but marching in disorder, in a longtrain, and heavily encumbered, were themselves cut to pieces. Theconsul, by proclamation, summoned the owners to Interamna, to claimand receive again their property, and leaving his army there, went toRome to hold the elections. On his applying for a triumph, that honourwas refused him, because he had lost so many thousands of hissoldiers; and also, because he had sent the prisoners under the yokewithout imposing any conditions."Book 10,Chapter 37,"The other consul, Postumius, because there was no employment forhis arms in Samnium, having led over his forces into Etruria, firstlaid waste the lands of the Volsinians; and afterwards, on theirmarching out to protect their country, gained a decisive victory overthem, at a small distance from their own walls. Two thousand twohundred of the Etrurians were slain; the proximity of their cityprotected the rest. The army was then led into the territory ofRusella, and there, not only were the lands wasted, but the townitself taken. More than two thousand men were made prisoners, andsomewhat less than that number killed on the walls. But a peace,effected that year in Etruria, was still more important and honourablethan the war had been. Three very powerful cities, the chief ones ofEtruria, (Volsinii, Perusia, and Arretium,) sued for peace; and havingstipulated with the consul to furnish clothing and corn for his army,on condition of being permitted to send deputies to Rome, theyobtained a truce for forty years, and a fine was imposed on each stateof five hundred thousand _asses_,[Footnote: £1614. _11s8d_] to be immediately paid. When the consul demanded a triumphfrom the senate, in consideration of these services, rather to complywith the general practice, than in hope of succeeding; and when he sawthat one party, his own personal enemies, another party, the friendsof his colleague, refused him the triumph, the latter to console asimilar refusal, some on the plea that he had been rather tardy intaking his departure from the city; others, that he had passed fromSamnium into Etruria without orders from the senate; he said,""Conscript fathers, I shall not be so far mindful of your dignity, asto forget that I am consul. By the same right of office by which Iconducted the war, I shall now have a triumph, when this war has beenbrought to a happy conclusion, Samnium and Etruria being subdued, andvictory and peace procured. With these words he left the senate."" Onthis arose a contention between the plebeian tribunes; some of themdeclaring that they would protest against his triumphing in a mannerunprecedented; others, that they would support his pretensions, inopposition to their colleagues. The affair came at length to bediscussed before the people, and the consul being summoned to attend,when he represented, that Marcus Horatius and Lucius Valerius, whenconsuls, and lately Caius Marcus Rutilus, father of the presentcensor, had triumphed, not by direction of the senate, but by that ofthe people; he then added that ""he would in like manner have laid hisrequest before the public, had he not known that some plebeiantribunes, the abject slaves of the nobles, would have obstructed thelaw. That the universal approbation and will of the people were andshould be with him equivalent to any order whatsoever."" Accordingly,on the day following, by the support of three plebeian tribunes, inopposition to the protest of the other seven, and the declaredjudgment of the senate, he triumphed; and the people paid every honourto the day. The historical accounts regarding this year are by nomeans consistent; Claudius asserts, that Postumius, after having takenseveral cities in Samnium, was defeated and put to flight in Apulia;and that, being wounded himself, he was driven, with a few attendants,into Luceria. That the war in Etruria was conducted by Atilius, andthat it was he who triumphed. Fabius writes, that the two consulsacted in conjunction, both in Samnium and at Luceria; that an army wasled over into Etruria, but by which of the consuls he has notmentioned; that at Luceria, great numbers were slain on both sides;and that in that battle, the temple of Jupiter Stator was vowed, thesame vow having been formerly made by Romulus, but the fane only, thatis, the area appropriated for the temple, had been yet consecrated.However, in this year, the state having been twice bound by the samevow, it became a matter of religious obligation that the senate shouldorder the temple to be erected."Book 10,Chapter 38,"In the next year, we find a consul, distinguished by the unitedsplendour of his own and his father's glory, Lucius Papirius Cursor,as also a war of vast importance, and a victory of such consequence,as no man, excepting Lucius Papirius, the consul's father, had everbefore obtained over the Samnites. It happened too that these had,with the same care and pains as on the former occasion, decoratedtheir soldiers with the richest suits of splendid armour; and theyhad, likewise, called in to their aid the power of the gods, having,as it were, initiated the soldiers, by administering the militaryoath, with the solemn ceremonies practised in ancient times, andlevied troops in every part of Samnium, under an ordinance entirelynew, that ""if any of the younger inhabitants should not attend themeeting, according to the general's proclamation, or shall departwithout permission, his head should be devoted to Jupiter."" Ordersbeing then issued, for all to assemble at Aquilonia, the wholestrength of Samnium came together, amounting to forty thousand men.There a piece of ground, in the middle of the camp, was enclosed withhurdles and boards, and covered overhead with linen cloth, the sidesbeing all of an equal length, about two hundred feet. In this placesacrifices were performed, according to directions read out of an oldlinen book, the priest being a very old man, called Ovius Paccius, whoaffirmed, that he took these ceremonials from the ancient ritual ofthe Samnites, being the same which their ancestors used, when they hadformed the secret design of wresting Capua from the Etrurians. Whenthe sacrifices were finished, the general ordered a beadle to summonevery one of those who were most highly distinguished by their birthor conduct: these were introduced singly. Besides the otherexhibitions of the solemnity, calculated to impress the mind withreligious awe, there were, in the middle of the covered enclosure,altars erected, about which lay the victims slain, and the centurionsstood around with their swords drawn. The soldier was led up to thealtars, rather like a victim, than a performer in the ceremony, andwas bound by an oath not to divulge what he should see and hear inthat place. He was then compelled to swear, in a dreadful kind ofform, containing execrations on his own person, on his family andrace, if he did not go to battle, whithersoever the commanders shouldlead; and, if either he himself fled from the field, or, in case heshould see any other flying, did not immediately kill him. At firstsome, refusing to take the oath, were put to death round the altars,and lying among the carcasses of the victims, served afterwards as awarning to others not to refuse it. When those of the first rank inthe Samnite nation had been bound under these solemnities, the generalnominated ten, whom he desired to choose each a man, and so to proceeduntil they should have called up the number of sixteen thousand. Thisbody, from the covering of the enclosure wherein the nobility had beenthus devoted, was called the linen legion. They were furnished withsplendid armour and plumed helmets, to distinguish them above therest. They had another body of forces, amounting to somewhat more thantwenty thousand, not inferior to the linen legion, either in personalappearance, or renown in war, or their equipment. This number,composing the main strength of the nation, sat down at Aquilonia."Book 10,Chapter 39,"On the other side, the consuls set out from the city. First,Spurius Carvilius, to whom had been decreed the veteran legions, whichMarcus Atilius, the consul of the preceding year, had left in theterritory of Interamna, marched at their head into Samnium; and, whilethe enemy were busied in their superstitious rites, and holding theirsecret meeting, he took by storm the town of Amiternum. Here wereslain about two thousand eight hundred men; and four thousand twohundred and seventy were made prisoners. Papirius, with a new army,which he raised in pursuance of a decree of the senate, made himselfmaster of the city of Duronia. He took fewer prisoners than hiscolleague; but slew much greater numbers. Rich booty was acquired inboth places. The consuls then, overrunning Samnium, and wasting theprovince of Atinum with particular severity, arrived, Carvilius atCominium, and Papirius at Aquilonia, where the main force of theSamnites were posted. Here, for some time, there was neither acessation of action, nor any vigorous effort. The day was generallyspent in provoking the enemy when quiet, and retiring when theyoffered resistance; in menacing, rather than making an attack. Bywhich practice of beginning, and then desisting, even those triflingskirmishes were continually left without a decision. The other Romancamp was twenty miles distant, and the advice of his absent colleaguewas appealed to on every thing which he undertook, while Carvilius, onhis part, directed a greater share of his attention to Aquilonia,where the state of affairs was more critical and important, than toCominium, which he himself was besieging. When Papirius had fullyadjusted every measure, preparatory to an engagement, he despatched amessage to his colleague, that ""he intended, if the auspicespermitted, to fight the enemy on the day following; and that it wouldbe necessary that he (Carvilius) should at the same time make anassault on Cominium, with his utmost force, that the Samnites theremight have no leisure to send any succour to Aquilonia."" The messengerhad the day for the performance of his journey, and he returned in thenight, with an answer to the consul, that his colleague approved ofthe plan. Papirius, on sending off the messenger, had instantly calledan assembly, where he descanted, at large, on the nature of the war ingeneral, and on the present mode of equipment adopted by the enemy,which served for empty parade, rather than for any thing effectualtowards insuring success; for ""plumes,"" he said, ""made no wounds; thata Roman javelin would make its way through shields, however paintedand gilt; and that the army, refulgent from the whiteness of theirtunics, would soon be besmeared with blood, when matters came to bemanaged with the sword. His father had formerly cut off, to a man, agold and silver army of the Samnites; and such accoutrements had madea more respectable figure, as spoils, in the hands of the conqueringfoe, than as arms in those of the wearers. Perhaps it was allotted, bydestiny, to his name and family, that they should be opposed incommand against the most powerful efforts of the Samnites; and shouldbring home spoils, of such beauty, as to serve for ornaments to thepublic places. The immortal gods were certainly on his side, onaccount of the leagues so often solicited and so often broken.Besides, if a judgment might be formed of the sentiments of thedeities, they never were more hostile to any army, than to that which,smeared with the blood of human beings mixed with that of cattle intheir abominable sacrifice, doomed to the twofold resentment of thegods, dreading on the one hand the divinities, witnesses of thetreaties concluded with the Romans, on the other hand the imprecationsexpressed in the oath sworn in contradiction to those treaties, sworewith reluctance, abhorred the oath, and feared at once the gods, theircountrymen, and their enemies."""Book 10,Chapter 40,"When the consul had recounted these particulars, ascertained fromthe information of the deserters, to the soldiers already enraged ofthemselves, they then, filled with confidence in both divine and humanaid, with one universal shout, demanded the battle; were dissatisfiedat the action being deferred to the following day; they are impatientunder the intended delay of a day and a night. Papirius, at the thirdwatch, having received his colleague's letter, arose in silence, andsent the keeper of the chickens to take the auspices. There was no onedescription of men in the camp who felt not earnest wishes for thefight: the highest and the lowest were equally eager; the generalwatching the ardour of the soldiers, and the soldiers that of thegeneral. This universal zeal spread even to those employed in takingthe auspices; for the chickens having refused to feed, the auspexventured to misrepresent the omen, and reported to the consul thatthey had fed voraciously.[Footnote: When the auspices were to betaken from the chickens, the keeper threw some of them food upon theground, in their sight, and opened the door of then coop. If they didnot come out; if they came out slowly; if they refused to feed, or atein a careless manner, the omen was considered as bad. On the contrary,if they rushed out hastily and ate greedily, so that some of the foodfell from their mouths on the ground, this was considered as an omenof the best import; it was called _tripudium solistinum_,originally, _terripavium_, from _terra_, and _pavire_, tostrike.] The consul, highly pleased, and giving notice that theauspices were excellent, and that they were to act under the directionof the gods, displayed the signal for battle. Just as he was going outto the field, he happened to receive intelligence from a deserter,that twenty cohorts of Samnites, consisting of about four hundredeach, had marched towards Cominium. Lest his colleague should beignorant of this, he instantly despatched a messenger to him, and thenordered the troops to advance with speed, having already assigned toeach division of the army its proper post, and appointed generalofficers to command them. The command of the right wing he gave toLucius Volumnius, that of the left to Lucius Scipio, that of thecavalry to the other lieutenants-general, Caius Caedicius and CaiusTrebonius. He ordered Spurius Nautius to take off the panniers fromthe mules, and to lead them round quickly, together with his auxiliarycohorts, to a rising ground in view; and there to show himself duringthe heat of the engagement, and to raise as much dust as possible.While the general was employed in making these dispositions, a disputearose among the keepers of the chickens, about the auspices of theday, which was overheard by some Roman horsemen, who, deeming it amatter not to be slighted, informed Spurius Papirius, the consul'snephew, that there was a doubt about the auspices. The youth, born inan age when that sort of learning which inculcates contempt of thegods was yet unknown, examined into the affair, that he might notcarry an uncertain report to the consul; and then acquainted him withit. His answer was, ""I very much applaud your conduct and zeal.However, the person who officiates in taking the auspices, if he makesa false report, draws on his own head the evil portended; but to theRoman people and their army, the favourable omen reported to me is anexcellent auspice."" He then commanded the centurions to place thekeepers of the chickens in the front of the line. The Samniteslikewise brought forward their standards; their main body followed,armed and decorated in such a manner, that the enemy afforded amagnificent show. Before the shout was raised, or the battle begun,the auspex, wounded by a random cast of a javelin, fell before thestandards; which being told to the consul, he said, ""The gods arepresent in the battle; the guilty has met his punishment."" While theconsul uttered these words, a crow, in front of him, cawed with aclear voice; at which augury, the consul being rejoiced, andaffirming, that never had the gods interposed in a more strikingmanner in human affairs, ordered the charge to be sounded and theshout to be raised."Book 10,Chapter 41,"A furious conflict now ensued, but with very unequal spirit [inthe combatants]. Anger, hope, and ardour for conquest, hurried on theRomans to battle, thirsting for their enemy's blood; while theSamnites, for the most part reluctantly, as if compelled by necessityand religious dread, rather stood on their defence, than made anattack. Nor would they, familiarized as they were to defeats, througha course of so many years, have withstood the first shout and shock ofthe Romans, had not another fear, operating still more powerfully intheir breasts, restrained them from flying. For they had before theireyes the whole scene exhibited at the secret sacrifice, the armedpriests, the promiscuous carnage of men and cattle, the altarsbesmeared with the blood of victims and of their murdered countrymen,the dreadful curses, and the direful form of imprecation, drawn up forcalling down perdition on their family and race. Prevented by theseshackles from running away, they stood, more afraid of then countrymenthan of the enemy. The Romans pushed on both the wings, and in thecentre, and made great havoc among them, stupified as they were,through their fears of the gods and of men. A faint resistance is nowmade, as by men whom fear alone prevented from running away. Theslaughter had now almost reached to their standards, when, on oneside, appeared a cloud of dust, as if raised by the marching of anumerous army: it was Spurius Nautius, (some say Octavius Metius,)commander of the auxiliary cohorts: for these raised a greaterquantity of dust than was proportioned to the number of men, theservants of the camp, mounted on the mules, trailing boughs of trees,full of leaves, along the ground. Through the light thus obscured,arms and standards were seen in front; behind, a higher and densercloud of dust presented the appearance of horsemen bringing up therear. This effectually deceived, not only the Samnites, but the Romansthemselves: and the consul confirmed the mistake, by calling out amongthe foremost battalions, so that his voice reached also the enemy,that ""Cominium was taken, and that his victorious colleague wasapproaching,"" bidding his men ""now make haste to complete the defeatof the enemy, before the glory should fall to the share of the otherarmy."" This he said as he sat on horseback, and then ordered thetribunes and centurions to open passages for the horse. He had givenprevious directions to Trebonius and Caedicius, that, when they shouldsee him waving the point of his spear aloft, they should incite thecavalry to charge the enemy with all possible violence. Everyparticular, as previously concerted, was executed with the utmostexactness. The passages were opened between the ranks, the cavalrydarted through, and, with the points of their spears presented, rushedinto the midst of the enemy's battalions, breaking down the rankswherever they charged. Voluminius and Scipio seconded the blow, andtaking advantage of the enemy's disorder, made a terrible slaughter.Thus attacked, the cohorts, called _linteatae_, regardless of allrestraints from either gods or men, quitted their posts in confusion,the sworn and the unsworn all fled alike, no longer dreading aught butthe enemies. The body of their infantry which survived the battle,were driven into the camp at Aquilonia. The nobility and cavalrydirected their flight to Bovianum. The horse were pursued by the Romanhorse, the infantry by their infantry, while the wings proceeded bydifferent roads; the right, to the camp of the Samnites; the left tothe city. Volumnius succeeded first in gaining possession of the camp.At the city, Scipio met a stouter resistance; not because theconquered troops there had gained courage, but because walls were abetter defence against armed men than a rampart. From these theyrepelled the enemy with stones. Scipio, considering that unless thebusiness were effected during their first panic, and before they couldrecover their spirits, the attack of so strong a town would be verytedious, asked his soldiers ""if they could endure, without shame, thatthe other wing should already have taken the camp, and that they,after all their success, should be repulsed from the gates of thecity?"" Then, all of them loudly declaring their determination to thecontrary, he himself advanced, the foremost, to the gate, with hisshield raised over his head: the rest, following under the like coverof their shields conjoined, burst into the city, and dispersing theSamnites who were near the gate, took possession of the walls, butthey ventured not to push forward into the interior of the city inconsequence of the smallness of their number."Book 10,Chapter 42,"Of these transactions the consul was for some time ignorant; andwas busily employed in calling home his troops, for the sun was nowhastening to set, and the approach of night rendered every placesuspicious and dangerous, even to victorious troops. Having rodeforward a considerable way, he saw on the right the camp taken, andheard on the left a shouting in the city, with a confused noise offighting, and cries of terror. This happened while the fight was goingon at the gate. When, on riding up nearer, he saw his own men on thewalls, and so much progress already made in the business, pleased athaving gained, through the precipitate conduct of a few, anopportunity of striking an important blow, he ordered the troops, whomhe had sent back to the camp, to be called out, and to march to theattack of the city: these, having made good their entrance on thenearest side, proceeded no farther, because night approached. Beforemorning, however, the town was abandoned by the enemy. There wereslain of the Samnites on that day, at Aquilonia, thirty thousand threehundred and forty; taken, three thousand eight hundred and seventy,with ninety-seven military standards. One circumstance, respectingPapirius, is particularly mentioned by historians: that, hardly everwas any general seen in the field with a more cheerful countenance;whether this was owing to his natural temper or to his confidence ofsuccess. From the same firmness of mind it proceeded, that he did notsuffer himself to be diverted from the war by the dispute about theauspices; and that, in the heat of the battle, when it was customaryto vow temples to the immortal gods, he vowed to Jupiter thevictorious, that if he should defeat the legions of the enemy, hewould, before he tasted of any generous liquor, make a libation to himof a cup of wine and honey. This kind of vow proved acceptable to thegods, and they conducted the auspices to a fortunate issue."Book 10,Chapter 43,"Matters were conducted with the same success by the other consulat Cominium: leading up his forces to the walls, at the first dawn, heinvested the city on every side, and posted strong guards opposite tothe gates to prevent any sally being made. Just as he was giving thesignal, the alarming message from his colleague, touching the march ofthe twenty Samnite cohorts, not only caused him to delay the assault,but obliged him to call off a part of his troops, when they wereformed and ready to begin the attack. He ordered Decius Brutus Scaeva,a lieutenant-general, with the first legion, ten auxiliary cohorts,and the cavalry, to go and oppose the said detachment; and in whateverplace he should meet the foe, there to stop and detain them, and evento engage in battle, should opportunity offer for it; at all eventsnot to suffer those troops to approach Cominium. He then commanded thescaling ladders to be brought up to the walls, on every side of thecity; and, under a fence of closed shields, advanced to the gates.Thus, at the same moment, the gates were broken open, and the assaultmade on every part of the walls. Though the Samnites, before they sawthe assailants on the works, had possessed courage enough to opposetheir approaches to the city, yet now, when the action was no longercarried on at a distance, nor with missile weapons, but in closefight; and when those, who had with difficulty gained the walls,having overcome the disadvantage of ground, which, they principallydreaded, fought with ease on equal ground, against an enemy inferiorin strength, they all forsook the towers and walls, and being drivento the forum, they tried there for a short time, as a last effort, toretrieve the fortune of the fight; but soon throwing down their arms,surrendered to the consul, to the number of eleven thousand fourhundred; four thousand three hundred and eighty were slain. Such wasthe course of events at Cominium, such at Aquilonia. In the middlespace between the two cities, where a third battle had been expected,the enemy were not found; for, when they were within seven miles ofCominium, they were recalled by their countrymen, and had no part ineither battle. At night-fall, when they were now within sight of theircamp, and also of Aquilonia, shouts from both places reaching themwith equal force induced them to halt; then, on the side of the camp,which had been set on fire by the Romans, the wide-spreading flamesindicating with more certainty the disaster [which had happened],prevented their proceeding any farther. In that same spot, stretchedon the ground at random under their arms, they passed the whole nightin great inquietude, at one time wishing for, at another dreading thelight. At the first dawn, while they were still undetermined to whatquarter they should direct their march, they were obliged to betakethemselves hastily to flight, being descried by the cavalry; whohaving gone in pursuit of the Samnites, that left the town in thenight, saw the multitude unprotected either by a rampart or advancedguard. This party had likewise been perceived from the walls ofAquilonia, and the legionary cohorts now joined in the pursuit. Thefoot were unable to overtake them, but about two hundred and eighty oftheir rear guard were cut off by the cavalry. In their consternationthey left behind them a great quantity of arms and eighteen militarystandards: they reached Bovianum with the rest of their party insafety, as far as could be expected after so disorderly a rout."Book 10,Chapter 44,"The joy of both Roman armies was enhanced by the success achievedon the other side. Each consul, with the approbation of his colleague,gave to his soldiers the plunder of the town which he had taken; and,when the houses were cleared, set them on fire. Thus, on the same day,Aquilonia and Cominium were both reduced to ashes. The consuls thenunited their camps, where mutual congratulations took place betweenthem and between their soldiers. Here, in the view of the two armies,Carvilius bestowed on his men commendations and presents according tothe desert of each; and Papirius likewise, whose troops had beenengaged in a variety of actions, in the field, in the assault of thecamp, and in that of the city, presented Spurius Nautius, SpuriusPapirius, his nephew, four centurions, and a company of the spearmen,with bracelets and crowns of gold:--to Nautius, on account of hisbehaviour at the head of his detachment, when he had terrified theenemy with the appearance as of a numerous army; to young Papirius, onaccount of his zealous exertions with the cavalry, both in the battleand in harassing the Samnites in their flight by night, when theywithdrew privately from Aquilonia; and to the centurions and companyof soldiers, because they were the first who gained possession of thegate and wall of that town. All the horsemen he presented with gorgetsand bracelets of silver, on account of their distinguished conduct onmany occasions. As the time was now come for withdrawing the army outof Samnium, the expediency was considered, as to whether they shouldwithdraw both, or at least one. It was concluded, that the lower thestrength of the Samnites was reduced, the greater perseverance andvigour ought to be used in prosecuting the war, so that Samnium mightbe given up to the succeeding consuls perfectly subjected. As therewas now no army of the enemy which could be supposed capable ofdisputing the field, there remained one mode of operations, thebesieging of the cities; by the destruction of which, they might beenabled to enrich their soldiers with the spoil; and, at the sametime, utterly to destroy the enemy, reduced to the necessity offighting, their all being at stake. The consuls, therefore, afterdespatching letters to the senate and people of Rome, containingaccounts of the services which they had performed, led away theirlegions to different quarters; Papirius going to attack Saepioura,Carvilius to Volana."Book 10,Chapter 45,"The letters of the consuls were heard with extraordinaryexultation, both in the senate-house and in the assembly of thepeople; and, in a thanksgiving of four days' continuance, the publicrejoicings were celebrated with zeal by individuals. These successeswere not only important in themselves to the Roman people, butpeculiarly seasonable; for it happened, that at the same timeintelligence was brought that the Etrurians were again in arms. Thereflection naturally occurred to people's minds, how it would havebeen possible, in case any misfortune had happened in Samnium, to havewithstood the power of Etruria; which, being encouraged by theconspiracy of the Samnites, and seeing both the consuls, and the wholeforce of the Romans, employed against them, had made use of thatjuncture, in which the Romans had so much business on their hands, forreviving hostilities. Ambassadors from the allies, being introduced tothe senate by the praetor Marcus Atilius, complained that theircountries were wasted with fire and sword by the neighbouringEtrurians, because they had refused to revolt from the Romans; andthey besought the conscript fathers to protect them from the violenceand injustice of their common enemy. The ambassadors were answered,that ""the senate would take care that the allies should not repenttheir fidelity."" That the ""Etrurians should shortly be in the samesituation with the Samnites."" Notwithstanding which, the businessrespecting Etruria would have been prosecuted with less vigour, hadnot information been received, that the Faliscians likewise, who hadfor many years lived in friendship with Rome, had united their armswith those of the Etrurians. The consideration of the near vicinity ofthat nation quickened the attention of the senate; insomuch that theypassed a decree that heralds should be sent to demand satisfaction:which being refused, war was declared against the Faliscians bydirection of the senate, and order of the people; and the consuls weredesired to determine, by lots, which of them should lead an army fromSamnium into Etruria. Carvilius had, in the mean time, taken from theSamnites Volana, Palumbinum, and Herculaneum; Volana after a siege ofa few days, Palumbinum the same day on which he approached the walls.At Herculaneum, it is true, the consul had two regular engagementswithout any decisive advantage on either side, and with greater losson his side than on that of the enemy; but afterwards, encamping onthe spot, he shut them up within their works. The town was besiegedand taken. In these three towns were taken or slain ten thousand men,of whom the prisoners composed somewhat the greater part. On theconsuls casting lots for the provinces, Etruria fell to Carvilius, tothe great satisfaction of the soldiers, who could no longer bear theintensity of the cold in Samnium. Papirius was opposed at Saepinumwith a more powerful force: he had to fight often in pitched battles,often on a march, and often under the walls of the city, against theeruptions of the enemy; and could neither besiege, nor engage them onequal terms; for the Samnites not only protected themselves by walls,but likewise protected their walls with numbers of men and arms. Atlength, after a great deal of fighting, he forced them to submit to aregular siege. This he carried on with vigour, and made himself masterof the city by means of his works, and by storm. The rage of thesoldiers on this occasion caused the greatest slaughter in the takingof the town; seven thousand four hundred fell by the sword; the numberof the prisoners did not amount to three thousand. The spoil, of whichthe quantity was very great, the whole substance of the Samnites beingcollected in a few cities, was given up to the soldiers."Book 10,Chapter 46,"The snow had now entirely covered the face of the country, andthey could no longer dispense with the shelter of houses: the consultherefore led home his troops from Samnium. While he was on his way toRome, a triumph was decreed him with universal consent; andaccordingly he triumphed while in office, and with extraordinarysplendour, considering the circumstances of those times. The cavalryand infantry marched in the procession, adorned with presents. Greatnumbers of civic, vallar, and mural crowns were seen.[Footnote:These marks of honour were bestowed for having saved the lives ofcitizens, or for having been the first to mount walls or ramparts.]The spoils of the Samnites were inspected with much curiosity, andcompared, in respect of magnificence and beauty, with those taken byhis father, which were well known, from being frequently exhibited asornaments of the public places. Several prisoners of distinction,renowned for their own exploits and those of their ancestors, were ledin the cavalcade. There were carried in the train two millions andthirty-three thousand _asses_ in weight.[Footnote: £4940 13s.6d.] This money was said to be produced by the sale of the prisoners.Of silver, taken in the cities, one thousand three hundred and thirtypounds. All the silver and brass were lodged in the treasury, no shareof this part of the spoil being given to the soldiers. The ill humourin the commons was further exasperated, because the tax for thepayment of the army was collected by contribution; whereas, said they,if the vain parade of conveying the produce of the spoil to thetreasury had been disregarded, donations might have been made to thesoldiers out of the spoil, and the pay of the army also supplied outof that fund. The temple of Quirinus, vowed by his father whendictator, (for that he himself had vowed it in the heat of battle, Ido not find in any ancient writer, nor indeed could he in so short atime have finished the building of it,) the son, in the office ofconsul, dedicated and adorned with military spoils. And of these, sogreat was the abundance, that not only that temple and the forum weredecorated with them, but some were also distributed among the alliesand colonies in the neighbourhood, to serve as ornaments to theirtemples and public places. Immediately after his triumph, he led hisarmy into winter quarters in the territory of Vescia; because thatcountry was harassed by the Samnites. Meanwhile, in Etruria, theconsul Carvilius having set about laying siege to Troilium, sufferedfour hundred and seventy of the richest inhabitants to depart; theyhad paid a large sum of money for permission to leave the place: thetown, with the remaining multitude, he took by storm. He afterwardsreduced, by force, five forts strongly situated, wherein were slaintwo thousand four hundred of the enemy, and not quite two thousandmade prisoners. To the Faliscians, who sued for peace, he granted atruce for a year, on condition of their furnishing a hundred thousand_asses_ in weight,[Footnote: £322 18s. 4d.] and that year's payfor his army. This business completed, he returned home to a triumph,which, though it was less illustrious than that of his colleague, inrespect of his share in the defeat of the Samnites, was yet raised toan equality with it, by his having put a termination to the war inEtruria. He carried into the treasury three hundred and ninetythousand _asses_ in weight.[Footnote: £1259 7s. 6d.] Out of theremainder of the money accruing to the public from the spoils, hecontracted for the building of a temple to Fors Fortuna, near to thatdedicated to the same goddess by king Servius Tullius; and gave to thesoldiers, out of the spoil, one hundred and two asses[3] each, anddouble that sum to the centurions and horsemen, who received thisdonative the more gratefully, on account of the parsimony of hiscolleague."Book 10,Chapter 47,"The favour of the consul saved from a trial, before the people,Postumius; who, on a prosecution being commenced against him by MarcusScantius, plebeian tribune, evaded, as was said, the jurisdiction ofthe people, by procuring the commission of lieutenant-general, so theindictment against him could only be held out as a threat, and not putin force. The The year having now elapsed, new plebeian tribunes hadcome unto office; and for these, in consequence of some irregularityon their appointments, others had been, within five days after,substituted in their room. The lustrum was closed this year by thecensors Publius Cornelius Arvina and Caius Marcius Rutilus. The numberof citizens rated was two hundred and sixty-two thousand three hundredand twenty-two. These were the twenty-sixth pair of censors since thefirst institution of that office; and this the nineteenth lustrum. Inthis year, persons who had been presented with crowns, inconsideration of meritorious behaviour in war, first began to wearthem at the exhibition of the Roman games. Then, for the first time,palms were conferred on the victors according to a custom introducedfrom Greece. In the same year the paving of the road from the templeof Mars to Bovillae was completed by the curule aediles, who exhibitedthose games out of fines levied on the farmers of the pastures. LuciusPapirius presided at the consular election, and returned consulsQuintus Fabius Gurges, son of Maximus, and Decius Junius BrutusScaeva. Papirius himself was made praetor. This year, prosperous inmany particulars, was scarcely sufficient to afford consolation forone calamity, a pestilence, which afflicted both the city and country:the mortality was prodigious. To discover what end, or what remedy,was appointed by the gods for that calamity, the books were consulted:in the books it was found that Aesculapius must be brought to Romefrom Epidaurus. Nor were any steps taken that year in that matter,because the consuls were fully occupied in the war, except that asupplication was performed to Aesculapius for one day."Book 11,,Book 12,,Book 13,,Book 14,,Book 15,,Book 16,,Book 17,,Book 18,,Book 19,,Book 20,,Book 21,Chapter 1,"I may be permitted to premise at this division of my work, whatmost historians. have professed at the beginning of their whole undertaking; thatI am about to relate the most memorable of all wars that were everwaged: the war which the Carthaginians, under the conduct of Hannibal,maintained with the Roman people. For never did any states and nationsmore efficient in their resources engage in contest; nor had theythemselves at any other period so great a degree of power and energy.They brought into action too no arts of war unknown to each other, butthose which had been tried in the first Punic war; and so various wasthe fortune of the conflict, and so doubtful the victory, that theywho conquered were more exposed to danger. The hatred with which theyfought also was almost greater than their resources; the Romans beingindignant that the conquered aggressively took up arms against theirvictors; the Carthaginians, because they considered that in theirsubjection it had been lorded over them with haughtiness and avarice.There is besides a story, that Hannibal, when about nine years old,while he boyishly coaxed his father Hamilcar that he might be taken toSpain, (at the time when the African war was completed, and he wasemployed in sacrificing previously to transporting his army thither,)was conducted to the altar; and, having laid his hand on theofferings, was bound by an oath to prove himself, as soon as he could,an enemy to the Roman people. The loss of Sicily and Sardinia grievedthe high spirit of Hamilcar: for he deemed that Sicily had been givenup through a premature despair of their affairs; and that Sardinia,during the disturbances in Africa, had been treacherously taken by theRomans, while, in addition, the payment of a tribute had been imposed."Book 21,Chapter 2,"Being disturbed with these anxieties, he so conducted himself forfive years in the African war, which commenced shortly after the peacewith Rome, and then through nine years employed in augmenting theCarthaginian empire in Spain, that it was obvious that he wasrevolving in his mind a greater war than he was then engaged in; andthat if he had lived longer, the Carthaginians under Hamilcar wouldhave carried the war into Italy, which, under the command of Hannibal,they afterwards did. The timely death of Hamilcar and the youth ofHannibal occasioned its delay. Hasdrubal, intervening between thefather and the son, held the command for about eight years. He wasfirst endeared to Hamilcar, as they say, on account of his youthfulbeauty, and then adopted by him, when advanced in age, as hisson-in-law, on account of his eminent abilities; and, because he washis son-in-law, he obtained the supreme authority, against the wishesof the nobles, by the influence of the Barcine faction, [Footnote:The Barcine faction derived its name from Hamilcar, who was surnamedBarca. Hanno appears to have been at the head of the opposite party.]which was very powerful with the military and the populace.Prosecuting his designs rather by stratagem than force, byentertaining the princes, and by means of the friendship of theirleaders, gaining the favour of unknown nations, he aggrandized theCarthaginian power, more than by arms and battles. Yet peace proved nogreater security to himself. A barbarian, in resentment of hismaster's having been put to death by him, publicly murdered him; and,having been seized by the bystanders, he exhibited the samecountenance as if he had escaped; nay, even when he was lacerated bytortures, he preserved such an expression of face, that he presentedthe appearance of one who smiled, his joy getting the better of hispains. With this Hasdrubal, because he possessed such wonderful skillin gaining over the nations and adding them to his empire, the Romanpeople had renewed the treaty, [Footnote: A. U. C. 526, thirteenyears after the conclusion of the first Punic war, being the sixthtreaty between the Carthaginians and Romans. The first was acommercial agreement made during the first consulate, in the year thatthe Tarquins were expelled from Rome; but is not mentioned by Livy.The second is noted by him, lib. vii. 27, and the third, lib. ix. 43.The fourth was concluded during the war with Pyrrhus and theTarentines, Polyb. V. iii. 25: and the fifth was the memorable treatyat the close of the first war] on the terms, that the river Iberusshould be the boundary of both empires; and that to the Saguntines,who lay between the territories of the two states, their libertyshould be preserved."Book 21,Chapter 3,"There was no doubt that in appointing a successor to Hasdrubal, theapprobation of the commons would follow the military prerogative, bywhich the young Hannibal had been immediately carried to thepraetorium, and hailed as general, amid the loud shouts andacquiescence of all. Hasdrubal had sent for him by letter, when scarceyet arrived at manhood; and the matter had even been discussed in thesenate, the Barcine faction using all their efforts, that Hannibalmight be trained to military service and succeed to his father'scommand. Hanno, the leader of the opposite faction, said, ""Hasdrubalseems indeed to ask what is reasonable, but I, nevertheless, do notthink his request ought to be granted."" When he had attracted tohimself the attention of all, through surprise at this ambiguousopinion, he proceeded: ""Hasdrubal thinks that the flower of youthwhich he gave to the enjoyment of Hannibal's father, may justly beexpected by himself in return from the son: but it would little becomeus to accustom our youth, in place of a military education, to thelustful ambition of the generals. Are we afraid that the son ofHamilcar should be too late in seeing the immoderate power andsplendour of his father's sovereignty? or that we shall not soonenough become slaves to the son of him, to whose son-in-law our armieswere bequeathed as an hereditary right? I am of opinion, that thisyouth should be kept at home, and taught, under the restraint of thelaws and the authority of magistrates, to live on an equal footingwith the rest of the citizens, lest at some time or other this smallfire should kindle a vast conflagration."""Book 21,Chapter 4,"A few, and nearly every one of the highest merit, concurred withHanno; but, as usually happens, the more numerous party prevailed overthe better. Hannibal, having been sent into Spain, from his very firstarrival drew the eyes of the whole army upon him. The veteran soldiersimagined that Hamilcar, in his youth, was restored to them; theyremarked the same vigour in his looks and animation in his eye thesame features and expression of countenance; and then, in a shorttime, he took care that his father should be of the least powerfulconsideration in conciliating their esteem. There never was a geniusmore fitted for the two most opposite duties of obeying andcommanding; so that you could not easily decide whether he were dearerto the general or the army: and neither did Hasdrubal prefer givingthe command to any other, when any thing was to be done with courageand activity; nor did the soldiers feel more confidence and boldnessunder any other leader. His fearlessness in encountering dangers, andhis prudence when in the midst of them, were extreme. His body couldnot be exhausted, nor his mind subdued, by any toil. He could alikeendure either heat or cold. The quantity of his food and drink wasdetermined by the wants of nature, and not by pleasure. The seasons ofhis sleeping and waking were distinguished neither by day nor night.The time that remained after the transaction of business was given torepose; but that repose was neither invited by a soft bed nor byquiet. Many have seen him wrapped in a military cloak, lying on theground amid the watches and outposts of the soldiers. His dress wasnot at all superior to that of his equals: his arms and his horseswere conspicuous. He was at once by far the first of the cavalry andinfantry; and, foremost to advance to the charge, was last to leavethe engagement. Excessive vices counterbalanced these high virtues ofthe hero; inhuman cruelty, more than Punic perfidy, no truth, noreverence for things sacred, no fear of the gods, no respect foroaths, no sense of religion. With a character thus made up of virtueand vices, he served for three years under the command of Hasdrubal,without neglecting any thing which ought to be done or seen by one whowas to become a great general."Book 21,Chapter 5,"But from the day on which he was declared general, as if Italy hadbeen decreed to him as his province, and the war with Rome committedto him, thinking there should be no delay, lest, while heprocrastinated, some unexpected accident might defeat him, as hadhappened to his father, Hamilcar, and afterwards to Hasdrubal, heresolved to make war the Saguntines. As there could be no doubt thatby attacking them the Romans would be excited to arms, he first ledhis army into the territory of the Olcades, a people beyond theIberus, rather within the boundaries than under the dominion of theCarthaginians, so that he might not seem to have had the Saguntinesfor his object, but to have been drawn on to the war by the course ofevents; after the adjoining nations had been subdued, and by theprogressive annexation of conquered territory. He storms and plundersCarteia, a wealthy city, the capital of that nation; at which thesmaller states being dismayed, submitted to his command and to theimposition of a tribute. His army, triumphant and enriched with booty,was led into winter-quarters to New Carthage. Having there confirmedthe attachment of all his countrymen and allies by a liberal divisionof the plunder, and by faithfully discharging the arrears of pay, thewar was extended, in the beginning of spring, to the Vaccaei. Thecities Hermandica and Arbocala were taken by storm. Arbocala wasdefended for a long time by the valour and number of its inhabitants.Those who escaped from Hermandica joining themselves to the exiles ofthe Olcades, a nation subdued the preceding summer, excite theCarpetani to arms; and having attacked Hannibal near the river Tagus,on his return from the Vaccaei, they threw into disorder his armyencumbered with spoil. Hannibal avoided an engagement, and havingpitched his camp on the bank, as soon as quiet and silence prevailedamong the enemy, forded the river; and having removed his rampart sofar that the enemy might have room to pass over, resolved to attackthem in their passage. He commanded the cavalry to charge as soon asthey should see them advanced into the water. He drew up the line ofhis infantry on the bank with forty elephants in front. The Carpetani,with the addition of the Olcades and Vaccaei amounted to a hundredthousand, an invincible army, were the fight to take place in the openplain. Being therefore both naturally ferocious and confiding in theirnumbers; and since they believed that the enemy had retired throughfear thinking that victory was only delayed by the intervention of theriver, they raise a shout, and in every direction, without the commandof any one, dash into the stream, each where it nearest to him. At thesame time, a heavy force of cavalry poured into the river from itsopposite bank, and the engagement commenced in the middle of thechannel on very unequal terms; for there the foot-soldier, having nosecure footing, and scarcely trusting to the ford, could be borne downeven by an unarmed horseman, by the mere shock of his horse urged atrandom; while the horseman, with the command of his body and hisweapons, his horse moving steadily even through the middle of theeddies, could maintain the fight either at close quarters or at adistance. A great number were swallowed up by the current; some beingcarried by the whirlpools of the stream to the side of the enemy, weretrodden down by the elephants; and whilst the last, for whom it wasmore safe to retreat to their own bank, were collecting together aftertheir various alarms, Hannibal, before they could regain courage aftersuch excessive consternation, having entered the river with his armyin a close square, forced them to fly from the bank. Having then laidwaste their territory, he received the submission of the Carpetanialso within a few days. And now all the country beyond the Iberus,excepting that of the Saguntines, was under the power of theCarthaginians."Book 21,Chapter 6,"As yet there was no war with the Saguntines, but already, in orderto a war, the seeds of dissension were sown between them and theirneighbours, particularly the Turetani, with whom when the same personsided who had originated the quarrel, and it was evident, not that atrial of the question of right, but violence, was his object,ambassadors were sent by the Saguntines to Rome to implore assistancein the war which now evidently threatened them. The consuls then atRome were Publius Cornelius Scipio and Tiberius Sempronius Longus,who, after the ambassadors were introduced into the senate, havingmade a motion on the state of public affairs, it was resolved thatenvoys should be sent into Spain to inspect the circumstances of theallies; and if they saw good reason, both to warn Hannibal that heshould refrain from the Saguntines, the allies of the Roman people,and to pass over into Africa to Carthage, and report the complaints ofthe allies of the Roman people. This embassy having been decreed butnot yet despatched, the news arrived, more quickly than any oneexpected, that Saguntum was besieged. The business was then referredanew to the senate. And some, decreeing Spain and Africa as provincesfor the consuls, thought the war should be maintained both by sea andland, while others wished to direct the whole hostilities againstSpain and Hannibal. There were others again who thought that an affairof such importance should not be entered on rashly; and that thereturn of the ambassadors from Spain ought to be awaited. Thisopinion, which seemed the safest, prevailed; and Publius ValeriusFlaccus, and Quintus Baebius Tamphilus, were, on that account, themore quickly despatched as ambassadors to Hannibal at Saguntum, andfrom thence to Carthage, if he did not desist from the war, to demandthe general himself in atonement for the violation of the treaty."Book 21,Chapter 7,"While the Romans thus prepare and deliberate, Saguntum was alreadybesieged with the utmost vigour. That city, situated about a mile fromthe sea, was by far the most opulent beyond the Iberus. Itsinhabitants are said to have been sprung from the island Zacynthus,and some of the Rutulian race from Ardea to have been also mixed withthem; but they had risen in a short time to great wealth, either bytheir gains from the sea or the land, or by the increase of theirnumbers, or the integrity of their principles, by which theymaintained their faith with their allies, even to their owndestruction. Hannibal having entered their territory with a hostilearmy, and laid waste the country in every direction, attacks the cityin three different quarters. There was an angle of the wall slopingdown into a more level and open valley than the other space around;against this he resolved to move the vineae, by means of which thebattering-ram might be brought up to the wall. But though the groundat a distance from the wall was sufficiently level for working thevineae, yet their undertakings by no means favourably succeeded, whenthey came to effect their object. Both a huge tower overlooked it, andthe wall, as in a suspected place, was raised higher than in any otherpart; and a chosen band of youths presented a more vigorousresistance, where the greatest danger and labour were indicated. Atfirst they repelled the enemy with missile weapons, and suffered noplace to be sufficiently secure for those engaged in the works;afterwards, not only did they brandish their weapons in defence of thewalls and tower, but they had courage to make sallies on the posts andworks of the enemy; in which tumultuary engagements, scarcely moreSaguntines than Carthaginians were slain. But when Hannibal himself,while he too incautiously approached the wall, fell severely woundedin the thigh by a javelin, such flight and dismay spread around, thatthe works and vineae had nearly been abandoned."Book 21,Chapter 8,"For a few days after, while the general's wound was being cured,there was rather a blockade than a siege: during which time, thoughthere was a respite from fighting, yet there was no intermission inthe preparation of works and fortifications. Hostilities, therefore,broke out afresh with greater fury, and in more places, in some evenwhere the ground scarcely admitted of the works, the vineae began tobe moved forward, and the battering-ram to be advanced to the walls.The Carthaginian abounded in the numbers of his troops; for there issufficient reason to believe that he had as many as a hundred andfifty thousand in arms. The townsmen began to be embarrassed, byhaving their attention multifariously divided, in order to maintaintheir several defences, and look to every thing; nor were they equalto the task, for the walls were now battered by the rams, and manyparts of them were shattered. One part by continuous ruins left thecity exposed; three successive towers and all the wall between themhad fallen down with an immense crash, and the Carthaginians believedthe town taken by that breach; through which, as if the wall had alikeprotected both, there was a rush from each side to the battle. Therewas nothing resembling the disorderly fighting which, in the stormingof towns, is wont to be engaged in, on the opportunities of eitherparty; but regular lines, as in an open plain, stood arrayed betweenthe ruins of the walls and the buildings of the city, which lay but aslight distance from the walls. On the one side hope, on the otherdespair, inflamed their courage; the Carthaginian believing that, if alittle additional effort were used, the city was his; the Saguntinesopposing their bodies in defence of their native city deprived of itswalls, and not a man retiring a step, lest he might admit the enemyinto the place he deserted. The more keenly and closely, therefore,they fought on both sides, the more, on that account, were wounded, noweapon falling without effect amidst their arms and persons. There wasused by the Saguntines a missile weapon, called falarica, with theshaft of fir, and round in other parts except towards the point,whence the iron projected: this part, which was square, as in thepilum, they bound around with tow, and besmeared with pitch. It had aniron head three feet in length, so that it could pierce through thebody with the armour. But what caused the greatest fear was, that thisweapon, even though it stuck in the shield and did not penetrate intothe body, when it was discharged with the middle part on fire, andbore along a much greater flame, produced by the mere motion, obligedthe armour to be thrown down, and exposed the soldier to succeedingblows."Book 21,Chapter 9,"When the contest had for a long time continued doubtful, and thecourage of the Saguntines had increased, because they had succeeded intheir resistance beyond their hopes, while the Carthaginian, becausehe had not conquered, felt as vanquished, the townsmen suddenly set upa shout, and drive their enemies to the ruins of the wall; thence theyforce them, while embarrassed and disordered; and lastly, drove themback, routed and put to flight, to their camp. In the mean time it wasannounced that ambassadors had arrived from Rome; to meet whommessengers were sent to the sea-side by Hannibal, to tell them thatthey could not safely come to him through so many armed bands ofsavage tribes, and that Hannibal at such an important conjuncture hadnot leisure to listen to embassies. It was obvious that, if notadmitted, they would immediately repair to Carthage: he thereforesends letters and messengers beforehand to the leaders of the Barcinefaction, to prepare the minds of their partisans, so that the otherparty might not be able in any thing to give an advantage to theRomans."Book 21,Chapter 10,"That embassy, therefore, excepting that the ambassadors wereadmitted and heard, proved likewise vain and fruitless. Hanno alone,in opposition to the rest of the senate, pleaded the cause of thetreaty, amidst deep silence on account of his authority, and not fromthe approbation of the audience. He said: that he had admonished andforewarned them by the gods, the arbiters and witnesses of treaties,that they should not send the son of Hamilcar to the army; that themanes, that the offspring of that man could not rest in peace, norever, while any one of the Barcine name and blood survived, would theRoman treaties continue undisturbed. ""You, supplying as it were fuelto the flame, have sent to your armies a youth burning with the desireof sovereign power, and seeing but one road to his object, if byexciting war after war, he may live surrounded by arms and legions.You have therefore fostered this fire, in which you now burn. Yourarmies invest Saguntum, whence they are forbidden by the treaty: erelong the Roman legions will invest Carthage, under the guidance ofthose gods through whose aid they revenged in the former war theinfraction of the treaty. Are you unacquainted with the enemy, or withyourselves, or with the fortune of either nation? Your good generalrefused to admit into his camp ambassadors coming from allies and inbehalf of allies, and set at nought the law of nations. They, however,after being there repulsed, where not even the ambassadors of enemiesare prohibited admittance, come to you: they require restitutionaccording to the treaty: let not guilt attach to the state, theydemand to have delivered up to them the author of the transgression,the person who is chargeable with this offence. The more gently theyproceed,--the slower they are to begin, the more unrelentingly, Ifear, when they have once commenced, will they indulge resentment. Setbefore your eyes the islands Aegates and Eryx, all that fortwenty-four years ye have suffered by land and sea. Nor was this boythe leader, but his father Hamilcar himself, a second Mars, as thesepeople would have it: but we had not refrained from Tarentum, that is,from Italy, according to the treaty; as now we do not refrain fromSaguntum. The gods and men have, therefore, prevailed over us; and asto that about which there was a dispute in words, whether of the twonations had infringed the treaty, the issue of the war, like anequitable judge, hath awarded the victory to the party on whose sidejustice stood. It is against Carthage that Hannibal is now moving hisvineae and towers: it is the wall of Carthage that he is shaking withhis battering-ram. The ruins of Saguntum (oh that I may prove a falseprophet!) will fall on our heads; and the war commenced against theSaguntines must be continued against the Romans. Shall we, therefore,some one will say, deliver up Hannibal? In what relates to him I amaware that my authority is of little weight, on account of my enmitywith his father. But I both rejoice that Hamilcar perished, for thisreason, that, had he lived we should have now been engaged in a warwith the Romans; and this youth, as the fury and firebrand of thiswar, I hate and detest. Nor ought he only to be given up in atonementfor the violated treaty; but even though no one demanded him, he oughtto be transported to the extremest shores of earth or sea, andbanished to a distance, whence neither his name nor any tidings of himcan reach us, and he be unable to disturb the peace of a tranquilstate. I therefore give my opinion, that ambassadors be sentimmediately to Rome to satisfy the senate; others to tell Hannibal tolead away his army from Saguntum, and to deliver up Hannibal himself,according to the treaty to the Romans; and I propose a third embassyto make restitution to the Saguntines."""Book 21,Chapter 11,"When Hanno had concluded, there was no occasion for any one tocontend with him in debate, to such a decree were almost all thesenators devoted to Hannibal; and they accused Hanno of having spokenwith more malignity than Flaccus Valerius, the Roman ambassador. Itwas then said in answer to the Roman ambassadors, ""that the war hadbeen commenced by the Saguntines, not by Hannibal; and that the Romanpeople acted unjustly if they preferred the Saguntines to the mostancient [Footnote: Alluding to the first treaty made in the yearthat the kings were expelled from Rome.] alliance of theCarthaginians."" Whilst the Romans waste time in sending embassies,Hannibal, because his soldiers were fatigued with the battles and theworks, allowed them rest for a few days, parties being stationed toguard the vineae and other works. In the mean time he inflames theirminds, now by inciting their anger against the enemy, now with thehope of reward. But when he declared before the assembled army, thatthe plunder of the captured city should be given to the soldiers, tosuch a degree were they all excited, that if the signal had beenimmediately given, it appeared that they could not have been resistedby any force. The Saguntines, as they had a respite from fighting,neither for some days attacking nor attacked, so they had not, bynight or day, ever ceased from toiling, that they might repair anewthe wall in the quarter where the town had been exposed by the breach.A still more desperate storming than the former then assailed them;nor whilst all quarters resounded with various clamours, could theysatisfactorily know where first or principally they should lendassistance. Hannibal, as an encouragement, was present in person,where a movable tower, exceeding in height all the fortifications ofthe city, was urged forward. When being brought up it had cleared thewalls of their defenders by means of the catapultae and ballistaeranged through all its stories, then Hannibal, thinking it afavourable opportunity, sends about five hundred Africans withpickaxes to undermine the wall: nor was the work difficult, since theunhewn stones were not fastened with lime, but filled in theirinterstices with clay, after the manner of ancient building. It fell,therefore, more extensively than it was struck, and through the openspaces of the ruins troops of armed men rushed into the city. Theyalso obtain possession of a rising ground; and having collectedthither catapultae and ballistae, so that they might have a fort inthe city itself, commanding it like a citadel, they surround it with awall: and the Saguntines raise an inner wall before the part of thecity which was not yet taken. On both sides they exert the utmostvigour in fortifying and fighting: but the Saguntines, by erectingthese inner defences, diminish daily the size of their city. At thesame time, the want of all supplies increased through the length ofthe siege, and the expectation of foreign aid diminished, since theRomans, their only hope, were at such a distance, and all the countryround was in the power of the enemy. The sudden departure of Hannibalagainst the Oretani and Carpetani [Footnote: The Carpetani havealready been mentioned, chap. v. The Oretani, then neighbours,occupied the country lying between the sources of the Baetis and theAnas, or what are now called the Guadalquiver and Guadiana. In a partof Orospeda they deduced their name from a city called Oretum, thesite of which has been brought to light in a paltry village to whichthe name of Oreto still remains.--_D'Anville_.] revived for alittle their drooping spirits; which two nations, though, exasperatedby the severity of the levy, they had occasioned, by detaining thecommissaries, the fear of a revolt, having been suddenly checked bythe quickness of Hannibal, laid down the arms they had taken up."Book 21,Chapter 12,"Nor was the siege of Saguntum, in the mean time, less vigorouslymaintained; Maharbal, the son of Himilco, whom Hannibal had set overthe army, carrying on operations so actively that neither the townsmennor their enemies perceived that the general was away. He both engagedin several successful battles, and with three battering-rams overthrewa portion of the wall; and showed to Hannibal, on his arrival theground all covered with fresh ruins. The army was thereforeimmediately led against the citadel itself, and a desperate combat wascommenced with much slaughter on both sides, and part of the citadelwas taken. The slight chance of a peace was then tried by two persons;Alcon a Saguntine, and Alorcus a Spaniard. Alcon, thinking he couldeffect something by entreaties, having passed over, without theknowledge of the Saguntines, to Hannibal by night, when his tearsproduced no effect, and harsh conditions were offered as from anexasperated conqueror, becoming a deserter instead of an advocate,remained with the enemy; affirming that the man would be put to deathwho should treat for peace on such terms. For it was required thatthey should make restitution to the Turdetani; and after delivering upall their gold and silver, departing from the city each with a singlegarment, should take up their dwelling where the Carthaginian shoulddirect. Alcon having denied that the Saguntines would accept suchterms of peace, Alorcus, asserting that when all else is subdued, themind becomes subdued, offers himself as the proposer of that peace.Now at that time he was a soldier of Hannibal's, but publicly thefriend and host of the Saguntines. Having openly delivered his weaponto the guards of the enemy and passed the fortifications, he wasconducted, as he had himself requested, to the Saguntine praetor;whither when there was immediately a general rush of every descriptionof people, the rest of the multitude being removed, an audience of thesenate is given to Alorcus; whose speech was to the following effect:"Book 21,Chapter 13,"""If your citizen Alcon, as he came to implore a peace fromHannibal, had in like manner brought back to you the terms of peaceproposed by Hannibal, this journey of mine would have beenunnecessary; by which circumstance I should not have had to come toyou as the legate of Hannibal, nor as a deserter. Since he hasremained with your enemies, either through your fault or his own,(through his own, if he counterfeited fear; through yours, if amongyou there be danger to those who tell the truth,) that you may not beignorant that there are some terms of safety and peace for you, I havecome to you in consideration of the ancient ties of hospitality whichsubsist between us. But that I speak what I address to you for yoursake and that of no other, let even this be the proof: that neitherwhile you resisted with your own strength, nor while you expectedassistance from the Romans, did I ever make any mention of peace toyou. But now, after you have neither any hope from the Romans, noryour own arms nor walls sufficiently defend you, I bring to you apeace rather necessary than just: of effecting which there is thussome hope, if, as Hannibal offers it in the spirit of a conqueror, youlisten to it as vanquished; if you will consider not what is takenfrom you as loss, (since all belongs to the conqueror,) but whateveris left as a gift. He takes away from you your city, which, alreadyfor the greater part in ruins, he has almost wholly in his possession;he leaves you your territory, intending to mark out a place in whichyou may build a new town; he commands that all the gold and silver,both public and private, shall be brought to him; he preservesinviolate your persons and those of your wives and children, providedyou are willing to depart from Saguntum, unarmed, each with twogarments. These terms a victorious enemy dictates. These, though harshand grievous, your condition commends to you. Indeed I do not despair,when the power of every thing is given him, that he will remitsomething from these terms. But even these I think you ought rather toendure, than suffer, by the rights of war, yourselves to beslaughtered, your wives and children to be ravished and dragged intocaptivity before your faces."""Book 21,Chapter 14,"When an assembly of the people, by the gradual crowding round ofthe multitude, had mingled with the senate to hear these proposals,the chief men suddenly withdrawing before an answer was returned, andthrowing all the gold and silver collected, both from public andprivate stores, into a fire hastily kindled for that purpose, thegreater part flung themselves also into it. When the dismay andagitation produced by this deed had pervaded the whole city, anothernoise was heard in addition from the citadel. A tower, long battered,had fallen down; and when a Carthaginian cohort, rushing through thebreach, had made a signal to the general that the city was destituteof the usual outposts and guards, Hannibal, thinking that there oughtto be no delay at such an opportunity, having attacked the city withhis whole forces, took it in a moment, command being given that allthe adults should be put to death; which command, though cruel, wasproved in the issue to have been almost necessary. For to whom ofthose men could mercy have been shown, who, either shut up with theirwives and children, burned their houses over their own heads, orabroad in arms made no end of fighting, except in death."Book 21,Chapter 15,"The town was taken, with immense spoil. Though the greater part ofthe goods had been purposely damaged by their owners, and resentmenthad made scarce any distinction of age in the massacre, and thecaptives were the booty of the soldiers; still it appears that somemoney was raised from the price of the effects that were sold, andthat much costly furniture and garments were sent to Carthage. Somehave written that Saguntum was taken in the eighth month after itbegan to be besieged; that Hannibal then retired to New Carthage, intowinter quarters; and that in the fifth month after he had set out fromCarthage he arrived in Italy. If this be so, it was impossible thatPublius Cornelius and Tiberius Sempronius could have been consuls, towhom both at the beginning of the siege the Saguntine ambassadors weredespatched, and who, during their office, fought with Hannibal; theone at the river Ticinus, and both some time after at the Trebia.Either all these events took place in a somewhat shorter period, orSaguntum was not begun to be besieged, but taken at the beginning ofthe year in which Publius Cornelius and Tiberius Sempronius wereconsuls. For the battle at Trebia could not have been so late as theyear of Cneius Servilius and Caius Flaminius, since Flaminius enteredon the office at Ariminum, having been created by the consul TiberiusSempronius; who, having repaired to Rome after the battle at Trebiafor the purpose of creating consuls, returned when the election wasfinished to the army into winter quarters."Book 21,Chapter 16,"Nearly about the same time, both the ambassadors who had returnedfrom Carthage brought intelligence to Rome that all appearances werehostile, and the destruction of Saguntum was announced. Then suchgrief, and pity for allies so undeservingly destroyed, and shame thataid was withheld, and rage against the Carthaginians, and fear for theissue of events, as if the enemy were already at the gates, took atonce possession of the senators, that their minds, disturbed by somany simultaneous emotions, trembled with fear rather thandeliberated. For they considered that neither had a more spirited orwarlike enemy ever encountered them nor had the Roman state been everso sunk in sloth, and unfit for war: that the Sardinians, theCorsicans, the Istrians, and the Illyrians, had rather kept in a stateof excitement than exercised the Roman arms; and with the Gauls it hadbeen more properly a tumult than a war. That the Carthaginian, aveteran enemy, ever victorious during the hardest service fortwenty-three years among the tribes of Spain, first trained to warunder Hamilcar, then Hasdrubal, now Hannibal, a most active leader,and fresh from the destruction of a most opulent city, was passing theIberus; that along with them he was bringing the numerous tribes ofSpain, already aroused, and was about to excite the nations of Gaul,ever desirous of war; and that a war against the world was to bemaintained in Italy and before the walls of Rome."Book 21,Chapter 17,"The provinces had already been previously named for the consuls;and having been now ordered to cast lots for them, Spain fell toCornelius, and Africa with Sicily to Sempronius. Six legions weredecreed for that year, and as many of the allies as should seem goodto the consuls, and as great a fleet as could be equipped. Twenty-fourthousand Roman infantry were levied, and one thousand eight hundredhorse: forty thousand infantry of the allies, and four thousand fourhundred horse: two hundred and twenty ships of three banks of oars,and twenty light galleys, were launched. It was then proposed to thepeople, ""whether they willed and commanded that war should be declaredagainst the people of Carthage;"" and for the sake of that war asupplication was made through the city, and the gods were imploredthat the war which the Roman people had decreed might have aprosperous and fortunate issue. The forces were thus divided betweenthe consuls. To Sempronius two legions were given, (each of theseconsisted of four thousand infantry and three hundred horse,) andsixteen thousand of the infantry of the allies, and one thousand eighthundred horse: one hundred and sixty ships of war, and twelve lightgalleys. With these land and sea forces Tiberius Sempronius wasdespatched to Sicily, in order to transport his army to Africa if theother consul should be able to prevent the Carthaginian from invadingItaly. Fewer troops were given to Cornelius, because Lucius Manlius,the praetor, also had been sent with no weak force into Gaul. Thenumber of ships in particular was reduced to Cornelius. Sixty of fivebanks of oars were assigned to him, (for they did not believe that theenemy would come by sea, or would fight after that mode of warfare,)and two Roman legions with their regular cavalry, and fourteenthousand of the infantry of the allies, with one thousand six hundredhorse. The province of Gaul being not as yet exposed to theCarthaginian invasion, had, in the same year, two Roman legions, tenthousand allied infantry, one thousand allied cavalry, and six hundredRoman."Book 21,Chapter 18,"These preparations having been thus made, in order that everything that was proper might be done before they commenced war, theysend Quintus Fabius, Marcus Livius, Lucius Aemilius, Caius Licinius,and Quintus Baebius, men of advanced years, as ambassadors intoAfrica, to inquire of the Carthaginians if Hannibal had laid siege toSaguntum by public authority; and if they should confess it, as itseemed probable they would, and defend it as done by public authority,to declare war against the people of Carthage. After the Romansarrived at Carthage, when an audience of the senate was given them,and Quintus Fabius had addressed no further inquiry than the one withwhich they had been charged, then one of the Carthaginians replied:""Even your former embassy, O Romans, was precipitate, when youdemanded Hannibal to be given up, as attacking Saguntum on his ownauthority: but your present embassy, though so far milder in words, isin fact more severe. For then Hannibal was both accused, and requiredto be delivered up: now both a confession of wrong is exacted from us,and, as though we had confessed, restitution is immediately demanded.But I think that the question is not, whether Saguntum was attacked byprivate or public authority, but whether it was with right or wrong.For in the case of our citizen, the right of inquiry, whether he hasacted by his own pleasure or ours, and the punishment also, belongs tous. The only dispute with you is, whether it was allowed to be done bythe treaty. Since, therefore, it pleases you that a distinction shouldbe made between what commanders do by public authority, and what ontheir own suggestion, there was a treaty between us made by the consulLutatius; in which, though provision was made for the allies of both,there is no provision made for the Saguntines, for they were not asyet your allies. But in that treaty which was made with Hasdrubal, theSaguntines are excepted; against which I am going to say nothing butwhat I have learned from you. For you denied that you were bound bythe treaty which Caius Lutatius the consul first made with us, becausethat it had neither been made by the authority of the senate nor thecommand of the people; and another treaty was therefore concluded anewby public authority. If your treaties do not bind you unless they aremade by your authority and your commands, neither can the treaty ofHasdrubal, which he made without our knowledge, be binding on us.Cease, therefore, to make mention of Saguntum and the Iberus, and letyour mind at length bring forth that with which it has long been inlabour."" Then the Roman, having formed a fold in his robe, said, ""Herewe bring to you peace and war; take which you please."" On this speechthey exclaimed no less fiercely in reply: ""he might give which hechose;"" and when he again, unfolding his robe, said ""he gave war,""they all answered that ""they accepted it, and would maintain it withthe same spirit with which they accepted it."""Book 21,Chapter 19,"This direct inquiry and denunciation of war seemed more consistentwith the dignity of the Roman people, both before and now, especiallywhen Saguntum was destroyed, than to cavil in words about theobligation of treaties. For if it was a subject for a controversy ofwords, in what was the treaty of Hasdrubal to be compared with theformer treaty of Lutatius, which was altered? Since in the treaty ofLutatius, was expressly added, ""that it should only be held good ifthe people sanctioned it;"" but in the treaty of Hasdrubal, neither wasthere any such exception; and that treaty during its life had been soestablished by the silence of so many years, that not even after thedeath of its author was any change made in it. Although even were theyto abide by the former treaty, there had been sufficient provisionmade for the Saguntines by excepting the allies of both states; forneither was it added, ""those who then were,"" nor ""those who shouldafterwards be admitted."" and since it is allowable to admit newallies, who could think it proper, either that no people should bereceived for any services into friendship? or that, being receivedunder protection, they should not be defended? It was only stipulated,that the allies of the Carthaginians should not be excited to revolt,nor, revolting of their own accord, be received. The Romanambassadors, according as they had been commanded at Rome, passed overfrom Carthage into Spain, in order to visit the nations, and either toallure them into an alliance, or dissuade them from joining theCarthaginians. They came first to the Bargusii, by whom having beenreceived with welcome, because they were weary of the Carthaginiangovernment, they excited many of the states beyond the Iberus to thedesire of a revolution. Thence they came to the Volciani, whose replybeing celebrated through Spain, dissuaded the other states from analliance with the Romans; for thus the oldest member in their councilmade answer: ""What sense of shame have ye, Romans, to ask of us thatwe should prefer your friendship to that of the Carthaginians, whenyou, their allies, betrayed the Saguntines with greater cruelty thanthat with which the Carthaginians, their enemies, destroyed them?There, methinks, you should look for allies, where the massacre ofSaguntum is unknown. The ruins of Saguntum will remain a warning asmelancholy as memorable to the states of Spain, that no one shouldconfide in the faith or alliance of Rome."" Having been then commandedto depart immediately from the territory of the Volciani, theyafterwards received no kinder words from any of the councils of Spain:they therefore pass into Gaul, after having gone about through Spainto no purpose."Book 21,Chapter 20,"Among the Gauls a new and alarming spectacle was seen, by reasonof their coming (such is the custom of the nation) in arms to theassembly. When, extolling in their discourse the renown and valour ofthe Roman people, and the wide extent of their empire, they hadrequested that they would refuse a passage through their territory andcities to the Carthaginian invading Italy; such laughter and yellingis said to have arisen, that the youths were with difficulty composedto order by the magistrates and old men. So absurd and shameless didthe request seem, to propose that the Gauls, rather than suffer thewar to pass on to Italy, should turn it upon themselves and exposetheir own lands to be laid waste instead of those of others. When thetumult was at length allayed, answer was returned to the ambassadors,""that they had neither experienced good from the Romans, nor wrongfrom the Carthaginians, on account of which they should either take uparms in behalf of the Romans, or against the Cathaginians. On thecontrary, they had heard that men of their nation had been driven fromthe lands and confines of Italy by the Roman people, that they had topay a tribute, and suffered other indignities."" Nearly the same wassaid and heard in the other assemblies of Gaul; nor did they hear anything friendly or pacific before they came to Marseilles. There, everything found out by the care and fidelity of the allies was made knownto them--""that the minds of the Gauls had been already prepossessed byHannibal, but that not even by him would that nation be found verytractable, (so fierce and untameable are their dispositions,) unlessthe affections of the chiefs should every now and then be conciliatedwith gold, of which that people are most covetous."" Having thus goneround through the tribes of Spain and Gaul, the ambassadors return toRome not long after the consuls had set out for their provinces. Theyfound the whole city on tiptoe in expectation of war, the report beingsufficiently confirmed, that the Carthaginians had already passed theIberus."Book 21,Chapter 21,"Hannibal, after the taking of Saguntum, had retired to NewCarthage into winter quarters; and there, having heard what had beendone and decreed at Rome and Carthage, and that he was not only theleader, but also the cause of the war, after having divided and soldthe remains of the plunder, thinking there ought to be no longerdelay, he calls together and thus addresses his soldiers of theSpanish race: ""I believe, tribes, that even you yourselves perceivethat, all the tribes of Spain having been reduced to peace, we musteither conclude our campaigns and disband our armies, or transfer thewar into other regions: for thus these nations will flourish amid theblessings not only of peace, but also of victory, if we seek fromother countries spoils and renown. Since, therefore, a campaign farfrom home soon awaits you, and it is uncertain when you shall againsee your homes, and all that is there dear to you, if any one of youwishes to visit his friends, I grant him leave of absence. I give youorders to be here at the beginning of spring, that, with the goodassistance of the gods, we may enter on a war which will prove one ofgreat glory and spoil."" This power of visiting their homes,voluntarily offered, was acceptable to almost all, already longing tosee their friends, and foreseeing in future a still longer absenceRepose through the whole season of winter, between toils alreadyundergone and those that were soon to be endured, repaired the vigourof their bodies and minds to encounter all difficulties afresh. At thebeginning of spring they assembled according to command. Hannibal,when he had reviewed the auxiliaries of all the nations, having goneto Gades, performs his vows to Hercules; and binds himself by newvows, provided his other projects should have a prosperous issue. Thendividing his care at the same time between the offensive and defensiveoperations of the war, lest while he was advancing on Italy by a landjourney through Spain and Gaul, Africa should be unprotected andexposed to the Romans from Sicily, he resolved to strengthen it with apowerful force. For this purpose he requested a reinforcement fromAfrica, chiefly of light-armed spearmen, in order that the Africansmight serve in Spain, and the Spaniards in Africa, each likely to be abetter soldier at a distance from home, as if bound by mutual pledges.He sent into Africa thirteen thousand eight hundred and fiftytargetteers, eight hundred and seventy Balearic slingers, and onethousand two hundred horsemen, composed of various nations. He ordersthese forces partly to be used as a garrison for Carthage and partlyto be distributed through Africa: at the same time having sentcommissaries into the different states, he orders four thousand chosenyouth whom they had levied to be conducted to Carthage, both as agarrison and as hostages."Book 21,Chapter 22,"Thinking also that Spain ought not to be neglected (and the lessbecause he was aware that it had been traversed by the Romanambassadors, to influence the minds of the chiefs,) he assigns thatprovince to his brother Hasdrubal, a man of active spirit, andstrengthens him chiefly with African troops: eleven thousand eighthundred and fifty African infantry, three hundred Ligurians, and fivehundred Balearians. To these forces of infantry were added fourhundred horsemen of the Libyphoenicians, a mixed race of Carthaginiansand Africans; of the Numidians and Moors, who border on the ocean, tothe number of one thousand eight hundred, and a small band ofIlergetes from Spain, amounting to two hundred horse: and, that nodescription of land force might be wanting, fourteen elephants. Afleet was given him besides to defend the sea-coast, (because it mightbe supposed that the Romans would then fight in the same mode ofwarfare by which they had formerly prevailed,) fifty quinqueremes, twoquadriremes, five triremes: but only thirty-two quinqueremes and fivetriremes were properly fitted out and manned with rowers. From Gadeshe returned to the winter quarters of the army at Carthage; and thencesetting out, he led his forces by the city Etovissa to the Iberus andthe sea-coast. There, it is reported, a youth of divine aspect wasseen by him in his sleep, who said, ""that he was sent by Jupiter asthe guide of Hannibal into Italy, and that he should, therefore,follow him, nor in any direction turn his eyes away from him."" Atfirst he followed in terror, looking no where, either around orbehind: afterwards, through the curiosity of the human mind, when herevolved in his mind what that could be on which he was forbidden tolook back, he could not restrain his eyes; then he beheld behind him aserpent of wonderful size moving along with an immense destruction oftrees and bushes, and after it a cloud following with thunderings fromthe skies; and that then inquiring ""what was that great commotion, andwhat the cause of the prodigy,"" he heard in reply: ""That it was thedevastation of Italy: that he should continue to advance forward, norinquire further, but suffer the fates to remain in obscurity."""Book 21,Chapter 23,"Cheered by this vision, he transported his forces in threedivisions across the Iberus, having sent emissaries before him toconciliate by gifts the minds of the Gauls, in the quarter throughwhich his army was to be led, and to examine the passes of the Alps.He led ninety thousand infantry and twelve thousand cavalry across theIberus. He then subdued the Ilergetes, the Bargusii, the Ausetani, andthat part of Lacetania which lies at the foot of the Pyrenaeanmountains; and he placed Hanno in command over all this district, thatthe narrow gorges which connect Spain with Gaul might be under hispower. Ten thousand infantry, and a thousand cavalry, were given toHanno for the defence of the country he was to occupy. After the armybegan to march through the passes of the Pyrenees, and a more certainrumour of the Roman war spread through the barbarians, three thousandof the Carpetanian infantry turned back: it clearly appeared that theywere not so much swayed by the prospect of the war as by the length ofthe journey and the insuperable passage of the Alps. Hannibal, becauseit was hazardous to recall or detain them by force, lest the fierceminds of the rest might also be irritated, sent home above seventhousand men, whom also he had observed to be annoyed with theservice, pretending that the Carpetani had also been dismissed by him."Book 21,Chapter 24,"Then, lest delay and ease might unsettle their minds, he crossesthe Pyrenees with the rest of his forces, and pitches his camp at thetown Illiberis. The Gauls, though they had heard that the war wasdirected against Italy, yet because there was a report that theSpaniards on the other side of the Pyrenees had been reduced by force,and that strong forces had been imposed on them, being roused to armsthrough the fear of slavery, assembled certain tribes at Ruscino. Whenthis was announced to Hannibal, he, having more fear of the delay thanof the war, sent envoys to say to their princes, ""that he wished toconfer with them; and that they should either come nearer toIlliberis, or that he would proceed to Ruscino, that their meetingmight be facilitated by vicinity: for that he would either be happy toreceive them into his camp, or would himself without hesitation cometo them: since he had entered Gaul as a friend, and not as an enemy,and would not draw the sword, if the Gauls did not force him, beforehe came to Italy."" These proposals, indeed, were made by hismessengers. But when the princes of the Gauls, having immediatelymoved their camp to Illiberis, came without reluctance to theCarthaginian, being won by his presents, they suffered his army topass through their territories, by the town of Ruscino, without anymolestation."Book 21,Chapter 25,"In the mean time no further intelligence had been brought intoItaly to Rome by the ambassadors of Marseilles than that Hannibal hadpassed the Iberus; when the Boii asked if he had already passed theAlps, revolted after instigating the Insubrians; not so much throughtheir ancient resentment towards the Roman people, as on account oftheir having felt aggrieved that the colonies of Placentia and Cremonahad been lately planted in the Gallic territory about the Po. Havingtherefore, suddenly taken up arms, and made an attack on that veryterritory, they created so much of terror and tumult, that not onlythe rustic population, but even the Roman triumvirs, Caius Lutatius,Caius Servilius, and Titus Annius, who had come to assign the lands,distrusting the walls of Placentia, fled to Mutina. About the name ofLuttius there is no doubt: in place of Caius Servilius and TitusAnnius, some annals have Quintus Acilius and Caius Herenrius; others,Publius Cornelius Asina and Caius Papirius Maso. This point is alsouncertain, whether the ambassadors went to expostulate to the Boiisuffered violence, or whether an attack was made on the triumvirswhile measuring out the lands. While they were shut up in Mutina, anda people unskilled in the arts of besieging towns, and, at the sametime, most sluggish at military operations, lay inactive before thewalls, which they had not touched, pretended proposals for a peacewere set on foot; and the ambassadors, being invited out to aconference by the chiefs of the Gauls, are seized, not only contraryto the law of nations, but in violation of the faith which was pledgedon that very occasion; the Gauls denying that they would set them freeunless their hostages were restored to them. When this intelligencerespecting the ambassadors was announced, and that Mutina and itsgarrison were in danger, Lucius Manlius, the praetor, inflamed withrage, led his army in haste to Mutina. There were then woods on bothsides of the road, most of the country being uncultivated. There,having advanced without previously exploring his route, he fellsuddenly into an ambuscade; and after much slaughter of his men, withdifficulty made his way into the open plains. Here a camp wasfortified, and because confidence was wanting to the Gauls to attackit, the spirit of the soldiers revived, although it was sufficientlyevident that their strength was much clipped. The journey was thencommenced anew; nor while the army was led in march through opentracts did the enemy appear: but, when the woods were again entered,then attacking the rear, amid great confusion and alarm of all, theyslew eight hundred soldiers, and took six standards. There was an endto the Gauls of creating, and to the Romans of experiencing terror,when they escaped from the pathless and entangled thicket; then easilydefending their march through the open ground, the Romans directedtheir course to Tanetum, a village near the Po; where, by a temporaryfortification, and the supplies conveyed by the river, and also by theaid of the Brixian Gauls, they defended themselves against the dailyincreasing multitude of their enemies."Book 21,Chapter 26,"When the account of this sudden disturbance was brought to Rome,and the senators heard that the Punic had also been increased by aGallic war, they order Caius Atilius, the praetor, to carry assistanceto Manlius with one Roman legion and five thousand of the allies,enrolled in the late levy by the consul: who, without any contest, forthe enemy had retired through fear, arrived at Tanetum. At the sametime Publius Cornelius, a new legion having been levied in the room ofthat which was sent with the praetor, setting out from the city withsixty ships of war, by the coast of Etruria and Liguria, and then themountains of the Salyes, arrived at Marseilles, and pitched his campat the nearest mouth of the Rhone, (for the stream flows down to thesea divided into several channels,) scarcely as yet well believingthat Hannibal had crossed the Pyrenaean mountains; whom when heascertained to be also meditating the passage of the Rhone, uncertainin what place he might meet him, his soldiers not yet beingsufficiently recovered from the tossing of the sea, he sends forward,in the mean time, three hundred chosen horses, with Massilian guidesand Gallic auxiliaries, to explore all the country, and observe theenemy from a safe distance. Hannibal, the other states being pacifiedby fear or bribes, had now come into the territory of the Volcae, apowerful nation. They, indeed, dwell on both sides of the Rhone: butdoubting that the Carthaginian could be driven from the hither bank,in order that they might have the river as a defence, havingtransported almost all their effects across the Rhone, occupied inarms the farther bank of the river. Hannibal, by means of presents,persuades the other inhabitants of the river-side, and some even ofthe Volcae themselves, whom their homes had detained, to collect fromevery quarter and build ships; and they at the same time themselvesdesired that the army should be transported, and their countryrelieved, as soon as possible, from the vast multitude of men thatburthened it. A great number, therefore, of ships and boats rudelyformed for the neighbouring passages, were collected together; and theGauls, first beginning the plan, hollowed out some new ones fromsingle trees; and then the soldiers themselves, at once induced by theplenty of materials and the easiness of the work, hastily formedshapeless hulks, in which they could transport themselves and theirbaggage, caring about nothing else, provided they could float andcontain their burthen."Book 21,Chapter 27,"And now, when all things were sufficiently prepared for crossing,the enemy over against them occupying the whole bank, horse and foot,deterred them. In order to dislodge them, Hannibal orders Hanno, theson of Bomilcar, at the first watch of the night, to proceed with apart of the forces, principally Spanish, one day's journey up theriver; and having crossed it where he might first be able, as secretlyas possible, to lead round his forces, that when the occasion requiredhe might attack the enemy in the rear. The Gauls, given him as guidesfor the purpose, inform him that about twenty-five miles from thence,the river spreading round a small island, broader where it wasdivided, and therefore with a shallower channel, presented a passage.At this place timber was quickly cut down and rafts formed, on whichmen, horses, and other burthens might be conveyed over. The Spaniards,without making any difficulty, having put their clothes in bags ofleather, and themselves leaning on their bucklers placed beneath them,swam across the river. And the rest of the army, after passing on therafts joined together, and pitching their camp near the river, beingfatigued by the journey of the night and the labour of the work, arerefreshed by the rest of one day, their leader being anxious toexecute his design at a proper season. Setting out next day from thisplace, they signify by raising a smoke that they had crossed, and werenot far distant; which when Hannibal understood, that he might not bewanting on the opportunity, he gives the signal for passing. Theinfantry already had the boats prepared and fitted; a line of shipshigher up transporting the horsemen for the most part near theirhorses swimming beside them, in order to break the force of thecurrent, rendered the water smooth to the boats crossing below. Agreat part of the horses were led across swimming, held by bridlesfrom the stern, except those which they put on board saddled andbridled, in order that they might be ready to be used by the rider themoment he disembarked on the strand."Book 21,Chapter 28,"The Gauls run down to the bank to meet them with various whoopingsand songs, according to their custom, shaking their shields abovetheir heads, and brandishing their weapons in their right hands,although such a multitude of ships in front of them alarmed them,together with the loud roaring of the river, and the mingled clamoursof the sailors and soldiers, both those who were striving to breakthrough the force of the current, and those who from the other bankwere encouraging their comrades on their passage. While sufficientlydismayed by this tumult in front, more terrifying shouts from behindassailed them, their camp having been taken by Hanno; presently hehimself came up, and a twofold terror encompassed them, both such amultitude of armed men landing from the ships, and this unexpectedarmy pressing on their rear. When the Gauls, having made a prompt andbold effort to force the enemy, were themselves repulsed, they breakthrough where a way seemed most open, and fly in consternation totheir villages around. Hannibal, now despising these tumultuary onsetsof the Gauls, having transported the rest of his forces at leisure,pitches his camp. I believe that there were various plans fortransporting the elephants; at least there are various accounts of theway in which it was done. Some relate, that after the elephants wereassembled together on the bank, the fiercest of them being provoked byhis keeper, pursued him as he swam across the water, to which he hadrun for refuge, and drew after him the rest of the herd; the mereforce of the stream hurrying them to the other bank, when the bottomhad failed each, fearful of the depth. But there is more reason tobelieve that they were conveyed across on rafts; which plan, as itmust have appeared the safer before execution, is after it the moreentitled to credit. They extended from the bank into the river oneraft two hundred feet long and fifty broad, which, fastened higher upby several strong cables to the bank, that it might not be carrieddown by the stream they covered, like a bridge, with earth thrown uponit, so that the beasts might tread upon it without fear, as over solidground. Another raft equally broad and a hundred feet long, fit forcrossing the river, was joined to this first; and when the elephants,driven along the stationary raft as along a road had passed, thefemales leading the way, on to the smaller raft which was joined toit, the lashings, by which it was slightly fastened, being immediatelylet go, it was drawn by some light boats to the opposite side. Thefirst having been thus landed, the rest were then returned for andcarried across. They gave no signs of alarm whatever while they weredriven along as it were on a continuous bridge. The first fear was,when, the raft being loosed from the rest, they were hurried into thedeep. Then pressing together, as those at the edges drew back from thewater, they produced some disorder, till mere terror, when they sawwater all around, produced quiet. Some, indeed, becoming infuriated,fell into the river; but, steadied by their own weight, having thrownoff their riders, and seeking step by step the shallows, they escapedto the shore."Book 21,Chapter 29,"Whilst the elephants were conveyed over, Hannibal, in the meantime, had sent five hundred Numidian horsemen towards the camp of theRomans, to observe where and how numerous their forces were, and whatthey were designing. The three hundred Roman horsemen sent, as wasbefore said, from the mouth of the Rhone, meet this band of cavalry;and a more furious engagement than could be expected from the numberof the combatants takes place. For, besides many wounds, the loss onboth sides was also nearly equal: and the flight and dismay of theNumidians gave victory to the Romans, now exceedingly fatigued. Therefell of the conquerors one hundred and sixty, not all Romans, butpartly Gauls: of the vanquished more than two hundred. Thiscommencement, and at the same time omen of the war, as it portended tothe Romans a prosperous issue of the whole, so did it also the successof a doubtful and by no means bloodless contest. When, after theaction had thus occurred, his own men returned to each general, Scipiocould adopt no fixed plan of proceeding, except that he should formhis measures from the plans and undertakings of the enemy: andHannibal, uncertain whether he should pursue the march he hadcommenced into Italy, or fight with the Roman army which had firstpresented itself, the arrival of ambassadors from the Boii, and of apetty prince called Magalus, diverted from an immediate engagement;who, declaring that they would be the guides of his journey and thecompanions of his dangers, gave it as their opinion, that Italy oughtto be attacked with the entire force of the war, his strength havingbeen no where previously impaired. The troops indeed feared the enemy,the remembrance of the former war not being yet obliterated; but muchmore did they dread the immense journey and the Alps, a thingformidable by report, particularly to the inexperienced."Book 21,Chapter 30,"Hannibal, therefore, when his own resolution was fixed to proceedin his course and advance on Italy, having summoned an assembly, worksupon the minds of the soldiers in various ways, by reproof andexhortation. He said, that ""he wondered what sudden fear had seizedbreasts ever before undismayed: that through so many years they hadmade their campaigns with conquest; nor had departed from Spain beforeall the nations and countries which two opposite seas embrace, weresubjected to the Carthaginians. That then, indignant that the Romansdemanded those, whosoever had besieged Saguntum, to be delivered up tothem, as on account of a crime, they had passed the Iberus to blot outthe name of the Romans, and to emancipate the world. That then the wayseemed long to no one, though they were pursuing it from the settingto the rising of the sun. That now, when they saw by far the greaterpart of their journey accomplished, the passes of the Pyreneessurmounted, amid the most ferocious nations, the Rhone, that mightyriver, crossed, in spite of the opposition of so many thousand Gauls,the fury of the river itself having been overcome, when they had theAlps in sight, the other side of which was Italy, should they haltthrough weariness at the very gates of the enemy, imagining the Alpsto be--what else than lofty mountains? That supposing them to behigher than the summits of the Pyrenees, assuredly no part of theearth reached the sky, nor was insurmountable by mankind. The Alps infact were inhabited and cultivated;--produced and supported livingbeings. Were they passable by a few men and impassable to armies? Thatthose very ambassadors whom they saw before them had not crossed theAlps borne aloft through the air on wings; neither were theirancestors indeed natives of the soil, but settling in Italy fromforeign countries, had often as emigrants safely crossed these veryAlps in immense bodies, with their wives and children. To the armedsoldier, carrying nothing with him but the instruments of war, what inreality was impervious or insurmountable? That Saguntum might betaken, what dangers, what toils were for eight months undergone! Now,when their aim was Rome, the capital of the world, could any thingappear so dangerous or difficult as to delay their undertaking? Thatthe Gauls had formerly gained possession of that very country whichthe Carthaginian despairs of being able to approach. That they must,therefore, either yield in spirit and valour to that nation which theyhad so often during those times overcome; or look forward, as the endof their journey, to the plain which spreads between the Tiber and thewalls of Rome."""Book 21,Chapter 31,"He orders them, roused by these exhortations, to refreshthemselves and prepare for the journey. Next day, proceeding upwardalong the bank of the Rhone, he makes for the inland part of Gaul: notbecause it was the more direct route to the Alps, but believing thatthe farther he retired from the sea, the Romans would be less in hisway; with whom, before he arrived in Italy, he had no intention ofengaging. After four days' march he came to the Island: there thestreams of the Arar and the Rhone, flowing down from differentbranches of the Alps, after embracing a pretty large tract of country,flow into one. The name of the Island is given to the plains that liebetween them. The Allobroges dwell near, a nation even in those daysinferior to none in Gaul in power and fame. They were at that time atvariance. Two brothers were contending for the sovereignty. The elder,named Brancus, who had before been king, was driven out by his youngerbrother and a party of the younger men, who, inferior in right, hadmore of power. When the decision of this quarrel was most opportunelyreferred to Hannibal, being appointed arbitrator of the kingdom, herestored the sovereignty to the elder, because such had been theopinion of the senate and the chief men. In return for this service,he was assisted with a supply of provisions, and plenty of allnecessaries, particularly clothing, which the Alps, notorious forextreme cold, rendered necessary to be prepared. After composing thedissensions of the Allobroges, when he now was proceeding to the Alps,he directed his course thither, not by the straight road, but turnedto the left into the country of the Tricastini, thence by the extremeboundary of the territory of the Vocontii he proceeded to theTricorii; his way not being any where obstructed till he came to theriver Druentia. This stream, also arising amid the Alps, is by far themost difficult to pass of all the rivers in Gaul; for though it rollsdown an immense body of water, yet it does not admit of ships;because, being restrained by no banks, and flowing in several and notalways the same channels, and continually forming new shallows and newwhirlpools, (on which account the passage is also uncertain to aperson on foot,) and rolling down besides gravelly stones, it affordsno firm or safe passage to those who enter it; and having been at thattime swollen by showers, it created great disorder among the soldiersas they crossed, when, in addition to other difficulties, they were ofthemselves confused by their own hurry and uncertain shouts."Book 21,Chapter 32,"Publius Cornelius the consul, about three days after Hannibalmoved from the bank of the Rhone, had come to the camp of the enemy,with his army drawn up in square, intending to make no delay infighting: but when he saw the fortifications deserted, and that hecould not easily come up with them so far in advance before him, hereturned to the sea and his fleet, in order more easily and safely toencounter Hannibal when descending from the Alps. But that Spain, theprovince which he had obtained by lot, might not be destitute of Romanauxiliaries, he sent his brother Cneius Scipio with the principal partof his forces against Hasdrubal, not only to defend the old allies andconciliate new, but also to drive Hasdrubal out of Spain. He himself,with a very small force, returned to Genoa, intending to defend Italywith the army which was around the Po. From the Druentia, by a roadthat lay principally through plains, Hannibal arrived at the Alpswithout molestation from the Gauls that inhabit those regions. Then,though the scene had been previously anticipated from report, (bywhich uncertainties are wont to be exaggerated,) yet the height of themountains when viewed so near, and the snows almost mingling with thesky, the shapeless huts situated on the cliffs, the cattle and beastsof burden withered by the cold, the men unshorn and wildly dressed,all things, animate and inanimate, stiffened with frost, and otherobjects more terrible to be seen than described, renewed their alarm.To them, marching up the first acclivities, the mountaineers appearedoccupying the heights over head; who, if they had occupied the moreconcealed valleys, might, by rushing out suddenly to the attack, haveoccasioned great flight and havoc. Hannibal orders them to halt, andhaving sent forward Gauls to view the ground, when he found there wasno passage that way, he pitches his camp in the widest valley he couldfind, among places all rugged and precipitous. Then, having learnedfrom the same Gauls, when they had mixed in conversation with themountaineers, from whom they differed little in language and manners,that the pass was only beset during the day, and that at night eachwithdrew to his own dwelling, he advanced at the dawn to the heights,as if designing openly and by day to force his way through the defile.The day then being passed in feigning a different attempt from thatwhich was in preparation, when they had fortified the camp in the sameplace where they had halted, as soon as he perceived that themountaineers had descended from the heights, and that the guards werewithdrawn, having lighted for show a greater number of fires than wasproportioned to the number that remained, and having left the baggagein the camp, with the cavalry and the principal part of the infantry,he himself with a party of light-armed, consisting of all the mostcourageous of his troops, rapidly cleared the defile, and took post onthose very heights which the enemy had occupied."Book 21,Chapter 33,"At dawn of light the next day the camp broke up, and the rest ofthe army began to move forward. The mountaineers, on a signal beinggiven, were now assembling from their forts to their usual station,when they suddenly behold part of the enemy overhanging them fromabove, in possession of their former position, and the others passingalong the road. Both these objects, presented at the same time to theeye and the mind, made them stand motionless for a little while; butwhen they afterwards saw the confusion in the pass, and that themarching body was thrown into disorder by the tumult which itselfcreated, principally from the horses being terrified, thinking thatwhatever terror they added would suffice for the destruction of theenemy, they scramble along the dangerous rocks, as being accustomedalike to pathless and circuitous ways. Then indeed the Carthaginianswere opposed at once by the enemy and by the difficulties of theground; and each striving to escape first from the danger, there wasmore fighting among themselves than with their opponents. The horsesin particular created danger in the lines, which, being terrified bythe discordant clamours which the groves and re-echoing valleysaugmented, fell into confusion; and if by chance struck or wounded,they were so dismayed that they occasioned a great loss both of menand baggage of every description: and as the pass on both sides wasbroken and precipitous, this tumult threw many down to an immensedepth, some even of the armed men; but the beasts of burden, withtheir loads, were rolled down like the fall of some vast fabric.Though these disasters were shocking to view, Hannibal however kepthis place for a little, and kept his men together, lest he mightaugment the tumult and disorder; but afterwards, when he saw the linebroken, and that there was danger that he should bring over his army,preserved to no purpose if deprived of their baggage, he hastened downfrom the higher ground; and though he had routed the enemy by thefirst onset alone, he at the same time increased the disorder in hisown army: but that tumult was composed in a moment, after the roadswere cleared by the flight of the mountaineers; and presently thewhole army was conducted through, not only without being disturbed,but almost in silence. He then took a fortified place, which was thecapital of that district, and the little villages that lay around it,and fed his army for three days with the corn and cattle he had taken;and during these three days, as the soldiers were neither obstructedby the mountaineers, who had been daunted by the first engagement, noryet much by the ground, he made considerable way."Book 21,Chapter 34,"He then came to another state, abounding, for a mountainouscountry, with inhabitants; where he was nearly overcome, not by openwar, but by his own arts of treachery and ambuscade. Some old men,governors of forts, came as deputies to the Carthaginian, professing,""that having been warned by the useful example of the calamities ofothers, they wished rather to experience the friendship than thehostilities of the Carthaginians: they would, therefore, obedientlyexecute his commands, and begged that he would accept of a supply ofprovisions, guides of his march, and hostages for the sincerity oftheir promises."" Hannibal, when he had answered them in a friendlymanner, thinking that they should neither be rashly trusted nor yetrejected, lest if repulsed they might openly become enemies, havingreceived the hostages whom they proffered, and made use of theprovisions which they of their own accord brought down to the road,follows their guides, by no means as among a people with whom he wasat peace, but with his line of march in close order. The elephants andcavalry formed the van of the marching body; he himself, examiningevery thing around, and intent on every circumstance, followed withthe choicest of the infantry. When they came into a narrower pass,lying on one side beneath an overhanging eminence, the barbarians,rising at once on all sides from their ambush, assail them in frontand rear, both at close quarters and from a distance, and roll downhuge stones on the army. The most numerous body of men pressed on therear; against whom the infantry, facing about and directing theirattack, made it very obvious, that had not the rear of the army beenwell supported, a great loss must have been sustained in that pass.Even as it was they came to the extremity of danger, and almost todestruction: for while Hannibal hesitates to lead down his divisioninto the defile, because, though he himself was a protection to thecavalry, lie had not in the same way left any aid to the infantry inthe rear; the mountaineers, charging obliquely, and on having brokenthrough the middle of the army, took possession of the road; and onenight was spent by Hannibal without his cavalry and baggage"Book 21,Chapter 35,"Next day, the barbarians running in to the attack between (the twodivisions) less vigorously, the forces were re-united, and the defilepassed, not without loss, but yet with a greater destruction of beastsof burden than of men. From that time the mountaineers fell upon themin smaller parties, more like an attack of robbers than war, sometimeson the van, sometimes on the rear, according as the ground affordedthem advantage, or stragglers advancing or loitering gave them anopportunity. Though the elephants were driven through steep and narrowroads with great loss of time, yet wherever they went they renderedthe army safe from the enemy, because men unacquainted with suchanimals were afraid of approaching too nearly. On the ninth day theycame to a summit of the Alps, chiefly through places trackless; andafter many mistakes of their way, which were caused either by thetreachery of the guides, or, when they were not trusted, by enteringvalleys at random, on their own conjectures of the route. For two daysthey remained encamped on the summit; and rest was given to thesoldiers, exhausted with toil and fighting: and several beasts ofburden, which had fallen down among the rocks, by following the trackof the army arrived at the camp. A fall of snow, it being now theseason of the setting of the constellation of the Pleiades, causedgreat fear to the soldiers, already worn out with weariness of so manyhardships. On the standards being moved forward at daybreak, when thearmy proceeded slowly over all places entirely blocked up with snow,and languor and despair strongly appeared in the countenances of all,Hannibal, having advanced before the standards, and ordered thesoldiers to halt on a certain eminence, whence there was a prospectfar and wide, points out to them Italy and the plains of the Po,extending themselves beneath the Alpine mountains; and said ""that theywere now surmounting not only the ramparts of Italy, but also of thecity of Rome; that the rest of the journey would be smooth anddown-hill; that after one, or, at most, a second battle, they wouldhave the citadel and capital of Italy in their power and possession.""The army then began to advance, the enemy now making no attemptsbeyond petty thefts, as opportunity offered. But the journey provedmuch more difficult than it had been in the ascent, as the declivityof the Alps being generally shorter on the side of Italy isconsequently steeper; for nearly all the road was precipitous, narrow,and slippery, so that neither those who made the least stumble couldprevent themselves from falling, nor, when fallen, remain in the sameplace, but rolled, both men and beasts of burden, one upon another."Book 21,Chapter 36,"They then came to a rock much more narrow, and formed of suchperpendicular ledges, that a light-armed soldier, carefully making theattempt, and clinging with his hands to the bushes and roots around,could with difficulty lower himself down. The ground, even before verysteep by nature, had been broken by a recent falling away of the earthinto a precipice of nearly a thousand feet in depth. Here when thecavalry had halted, as if at the end of their journey, it is announcedto Hannibal, wondering what obstructed the march that the rock wasimpassable. Having then gone himself to view the place, it seemedclear to him that he must lead his army round it, by however great acircuit, through the pathless and untrodden regions around. But thisroute also proved impracticable; for while the new snow of a moderatedepth remained on the old, which had not been removed, their footstepswere planted with ease as they walked upon the new snow, which wassoft and not too deep; but when it was dissolved by the trampling ofso many men and beasts of burden, they then walked on the bare icebelow, and through the dirty fluid formed by the melting snow. Herethere was a wretched struggle, both on account of the slippery ice notaffording any hold to the step, and giving way beneath the foot morereadily by reason of the slope; and whether they assisted themselvesin rising by their hands or their knees, their supports themselvesgiving way, they would stumble again; nor were there any stumps orroots near; by pressing against which, one might with hand or footsupport himself; so that they only floundered on the smooth ice andamid the melted snow. The beasts of burden sometimes also went intothis lower ice by merely treading upon it, at others they broke itcompletely through, by the violence with which they struck in theirhoofs in their struggling, so that most of them, as if taken in atrap, stuck in the hardened and deeply frozen ice."Book 21,Chapter 37,"At length, after the men and beasts of burden had been fatigued tono purpose, the camp was pitched on the summit, the ground beingcleared for that purpose with great difficulty, so much snow was thereto be dug out and carried away. The soldiers being then set to make away down the cliff by which alone a passage could be effected, and itbeing necessary that they should cut through the rocks, having felledand lopped a number of large trees which grew around, they make a hugepile of timber; and as soon as a strong wind fit for exciting theflames arose, they set fire to it, and, pouring vinegar on the heatedstones, they render them soft and crumbling. They then open a way withiron instruments through the rock thus heated by the fire, and softenits declivities by gentle windings, so that not only the beasts ofburden, but also the elephants could be led down it. Four days werespent about this rock, the beasts nearly perishing through hunger: forthe summits of the mountains are for the most part bare, and if thereis any pasture the snows bury it. The lower parts contain valleys, andsome sunny hills, and rivulets flowing beside woods, and scenes moreworthy of the abode of man. There the beasts of burden were sent outto pasture, and rest given for three days to the men, fatigued withforming the passage: they then descended into the plains, the countryand the dispositions of the inhabitants being now less rugged."Book 21,Chapter 38,"In this manner chiefly they came to Italy in the fifth month (assome authors relate) after leaving New Carthage, having crossed theAlps in fifteen days. What number of forces Hannibal had when he hadpassed into Italy is by no means agreed upon by authors. Those whostate them at the highest, make mention of a hundred thousand foot andtwenty thousand horse; those who state them at the lowest, of twentythousand foot and six thousand horse. Lucius Cincius Alimentus, whorelates that he was made prisoner by Hannibal, would influence me mostas an authority, did he not confound the number by adding the Gaulsand Ligurians. Including these, (who, it is more probable, flocked tohim afterwards, and so some authors assert,) he says, that eightythousand foot and ten thousand horse were brought into Italy; and thathe had heard from Hannibal himself, that after crossing the Rhone hehad lost thirty-six thousand men, and an immense number of horses, andother beasts of burden, among the Taurini, the next nation to theGauls, as he descended into Italy. As this circumstance is agreed onby all, I am the more surprised that it should be doubtful by whatroad he crossed the Alps; and that it should commonly be believed thathe passed over the Pennine mountain, and that thence [Footnote: fromPaenus, Carthaginian.] the name was given to that ridge of the Alps.Coelius says, that he passed over the top of Mount Cremo; both whichpasses would have brought him, not to the Taurini, but through theSalasian mountaineers to the Libuan Gauls. Neither is it probable thatthese roads into Gaul were then open, especially once those which,lead to the Pennine mountain would have been unlocked up by nationshalf German; nor by Hercules (if this argument has weight with anyone) do the Veragri, the inhabitants of this ridge, know of the namebeing given to these mountains from the passage of the Carthaginians,but from the divinity, whom the mountaineers style Penninus,worshipped on the highest summit."Book 21,Chapter 39,"Very opportunely for the commencement of his operations, a war hadbroken out with the Taurini, the nearest nation, against theInsubrians; but Hannibal could not put his troops under arms to assisteither party, as they very chiefly felt the disorders they had beforecontracted, in remedying them; for ease after toil, plenty after want,and attention to their persons after dirt and filth, had variouslyaffected their squalid and almost savage-looking bodies. This was thereason that Publius Cornelius, the consul, when he had arrived at Pisawith his fleet, hastened to the Po, though the troops he received fromManlius and Atilius were raw and disheartened by their late disgraces,in order that he might engage the enemy when not yet recruited. Butwhen the consul came to Placentia, Hannibal had already moved from hisquarters, and had taken by storm one city of the Taurini, the capitalof the nation, because they did not come willingly into his alliance;and he would have gained over to him, not only from fear, but alsofrom inclination, the Gauls who dwell beside the Po, had not thearrival of the consul suddenly checked them while watching for anopportunity of revolt. Hannibal at the same time moved from theTaurini, thinking that the Gauls, uncertain which side to choose,would follow him if present among them. The armies were now almost insight of each other, and their leaders, though not at presentsufficiently acquainted, yet met each other with a certain feeling ofmutual admiration. For the name of Hannibal, even before thedestruction of Saguntum, was very celebrated among the Romans; andHannibal believed Scipio to be a superior man, from the verycircumstance of his having been specially chosen to act as commanderagainst himself. They had increased too their estimation of eachother; Scipio, because, being left behind in Gaul, he had met Hannibalwhen he had crossed into Italy; Hannibal, by his daring attempt ofcrossing the Alps and by its accomplishment. Scipio, however, was thefirst to cross the Po, and having pitched his camp at the riverTicinus, he delivered the following oration for the sake ofencouraging his soldiers before he led them out to form for battle:"Book 21,Chapter 40,"""If, soldiers, I were leading out that army to battle which I hadwith me in Gaul, I should have thought it superfluous to address you;for of what use would it be to exhort either those horsemen who sogloriously vanquished the cavalry of the enemy at the river Rhone, orthose legions with whom, pursuing this very enemy flying before us, Iobtained in lieu of victory, a confession of superiority, shown by hisretreat and refusal to fight? Now because that army, levied for theprovince of Spain, maintains the war under my auspices [Footnote:Because Spain was his proper province as consul.] and the command ofmy brother Cneius Scipio, in the country where the senate and peopleof Rome wished him to serve, and since I, that you might have a consulfor your leader against Hannibal and the Carthaginians, have offeredmyself voluntarily for this contest, few words are required to beaddressed from a new commander to soldiers unacquainted with him. Thatyou may not be ignorant of the nature of the war nor of the enemy, youhave to fight, soldiers, with those whom in the former war youconquered both by land and sea; from whom you have exacted tribute fortwenty years; from whom you hold Sicily and Sardinia, taken as theprizes of victory. In the present contest, therefore, you and theywill have those feelings which are wont to belong to the victors andthe vanquished. Nor are they now about to fight because they aredaring, but because it is unavoidable; except you can believe thatthey who declined the engagement when their forces were entire, shouldhave now gained more confidence when two-thirds of their infantry andcavalry have been lost in the passage of the Alps, and when almostgreater numbers have perished than survive. Yes, they are few indeed,(some may say,) but they are vigorous in mind and body; men whosestrength and power scarce any force may withstand. On the contrary,they are but the resemblances, nay, are rather the shadows of men;being worn out with hunger, cold, dirt, and filth, and bruised andenfeebled among stones and rocks. Besides all this, their joints arefrost-bitten, their sinews stiffened with the snow, their limbswithered up by the frost, their armour battered and shivered, theirhorses lame and powerless. With such cavalry, with such infantry, youhave to fight: you will not have enemies in reality, but rather theirlast remains. And I fear nothing more than that when you have foughtHannibal, the Alps may appear to have conquered him. But perhaps itwas fitting that the gods themselves should, without any human aid,commence and carry forward a war with a leader and a people thatviolate the faith of treaties; and that we, who next to the gods havebeen injured, should finish the contest thus commenced and nearlycompleted."""Book 21,Chapter 41,"""I do not fear lest any one should think that I say thisostentatiously for the sake of encouraging you, while in my own mind Iam differently affected. I was at liberty to go with my army intoSpain, my own province, whither I had already set out; where I shouldhave had a brother as the bearer of my councils and my dangers, andHasdrubal, instead of Hannibal, for my antagonist, and withoutquestion a less laborious war: nevertheless, as I sailed along thecoast of Gaul, having landed on hearing of this enemy, and having sentforward the cavalry, I moved my camp to the Rhone. In a battle ofcavalry, with which part of my forces the opportunity of engaging wasafforded, I routed the enemy; and because I could not overtake by landhis army of infantry, which was rapidly hurried away, as if in flight,having returned to the ships with all the speed I could, aftercompassing such an extent of sea and land, I have met him at the footof the Alps. Whether do I appear, while declining the contest, to havefallen in unexpectedly with this dreaded foe, or encounter him in histrack? to challenge him and drag him out to decide the contest? I amanxious to try whether the earth has suddenly, in these twenty years,sent forth a new race of Carthaginians, or whether these are the samewho fought at the islands Aegates, and whom you permitted to defeatfrom Eryx, valued at eighteen denarii a head; and whether thisHannibal be, as he himself gives out, the rival of the expeditions ofHercules, or one left by his father the tributary and taxed subjectand slave of the Roman people; who, did not his guilt at Saguntumdrive him to frenzy, would certainly reflect, if not upon hisconquered country, at least on his family, and his father, and thetreaties written by the hand of Hamilcar; who, at the command of ourconsul, withdrew the garrison from Eryx; who, indignant and grieving,submitted to the harsh conditions imposed on the conqueredCarthaginians; who agreed to depart from Sicily, and pay tribute tothe Roman people. I would, therefore, have you fight, soldiers, notonly with that spirit with which you are wont to encounter otherenemies, but with a certain indignation and resentment, as if you sawyour slaves suddenly taking up arms against you. We might have killedthem when shut up in Eryx by hunger, the most dreadful of humantortures; we might have carried over our victorious fleet to Africa,and in a few days have destroyed Carthage without any opposition. Wegranted pardon to their prayers; we released them from the blockade;we made peace with them when conquered; and we afterwards consideredthem under our protection when they were oppressed by the African war.In return for these benefits, they come under the conduct of a furiousyouth to attack our country. And I wish that the contest on your sidewas for glory, and not for safety: it is not about the possession ofSicily and Sardinia, concerning which the dispute was formerly, butfor Italy, that you must fight: nor is there another army behind,which, if we should not conquer, can resist the enemy; nor are thereother Alps, during the passage of which fresh forces may be procured:here, soldiers, we must make our stand, as if we fought before thewalls of Rome. Let every one consider that he defends with his armsnot only his own person, but his wife and young children: nor let himonly entertain domestic cares and anxieties, but at the same time lethim revolve in his mind, that the senate and people of Rome nowanxiously regard our efforts; and that according as our strength andvalour shall be, such henceforward will be the fortune of that cityand of the Roman empire."""Book 21,Chapter 42,"Thus the consul addressed the Romans. Hannibal, thinking that hissoldiers ought to be roused by deeds rather than by words, havingdrawn his army around for the spectacle, placed in their midst thecaptive mountaineers in fetters; and after Gallic arms had been thrownat their feet, he ordered the interpreter to ask, ""whether any amongthem, on condition of being released from chains, and receiving, ifvictorious, armour and a horse, was willing to combat with the sword?""When they all, to a man, demanded the combat and the sword, and lotswere cast into the urn for that purpose, each wished himself theperson whom fortune might select for the contest. As the lot of eachman came out, eager and exulting with joy amidst the congratulationsof his comrades, and dancing after the national custom, he hastilysnatched up the arms: but when they fought, such was the state offeeling, not only among their companions in the same circumstances,but among the spectators in general, that the fortune of those whoconquered was not praised more than that of those who died bravely."Book 21,Chapter 43,"When he had dismissed the soldiers, thus affected after viewingseveral pairs of combatants, having then summoned an assembly, he issaid to have addressed them in these terms: ""If, soldiers, you shallby and by, in judging of your own fortune, preserve the same feelingswhich you experienced a little before in the example of the fate ofothers, we have already conquered; for neither was that merely aspectacle, but as it were a certain representation of your condition.And I know not whether fortune has not thrown around you stillstronger chains and more urgent necessities than around your captives.On the right and left two seas enclose you, without your possessing asingle ship even for escape. The river Po around you, the Po largerand more impetuous than the Rhone, the Alps behind, scarcely passed byyou when fresh and vigorous, hem you in. Here, soldiers, where youhave first met the enemy, you must conquer or die; and the samefortune which has imposed the necessity of fighting, holds out to you,if victorious, rewards, than which men are not wont to desire greater,even from the immortal gods. If we were only about to recover by ourvalour Sicily and Sardinia, wrested from our fathers, the recompencewould be sufficiently ample; but whatever, acquired and amassed by somany triumphs, the Romans possess, all, with its masters themselves,will become yours. To gain this rich reward, hasten, then, and seizeyour arms with the favour of the gods. Long enough in pursuing cattleamong the desert mountains of Lusitania [Footnote: The ancient nameof Portugal.] and Celtiberia, you have seen no emolument from so manytoils and dangers: it is time to make rich and profitable campaigns,and to gain the great reward of your labours, after havingaccomplished such a length of journey over so many mountains andrivers, and so many nations in arms. Here fortune has granted you thetermination of your labours; here she will bestow a reward worthy ofthe service you have undergone. Nor, in proportion as the war is greatin name, ought you to consider that the victory will be difficult. Adespised enemy has often maintained a sanguinary contest, and renownedstates and kings been conquered by a very slight effort. For, settingaside only the splendour of the Roman name, what remains in which theycan be compared to you? To pass over in silence your service fortwenty years, distinguished by such valour and success you have madeyour way to this place from the pillars of Hercules, [Footnote:Calpe, a mountain or rather rock in Spain, and Abyla in Africa, fabledto have been placed by Hercules as marks of his most distant voyage,are now well known as Gibraltar and Ceuta.] from the ocean, and theremotest limits of the world advancing victorious through so many ofthe fiercest nations of Gaul and Spain: you will fight with a rawarmy, which this very summer was beaten, conquered, and surrounded bythe Gauls, as yet unknown to its general, and ignorant of him. Shall Icompare myself, almost born, and certainly bred in the tent of myfather, that most illustrious commander, myself the subjugator ofSpain and Gaul, the conqueror too not only of the Alpine nations, butwhat is much more, of the Alps themselves, with this six months'general, the deserter of his army? To whom, if any one, having takenaway their standards, should show to-day the Carthaginians and Romans,I am sure that he would not know of which army he was consul. I do notregard it, soldiers, as of small account, that there is not a manamong you before whose eyes I have not often achieved some militaryexploit; and to whom, in like manner, I the spectator and witness ofhis valour, could not recount his own gallant deeds, particularized bytime and place. With soldiers who have a thousand times received mypraises and gifts, I, who was the pupil of you all before I becameyour commander, will march out in battle-array against those who areunknown to and ignorant of each other."""Book 21,Chapter 44,"""On whatever side I turn my eyes I see nothing but what is full ofcourage and energy; a veteran infantry; calvary, both those with andthose without the bridle, composed of the most gallant nations, youour most faithful and valiant allies, you Carthaginians, who are aboutto fight as well for the sake of your country as from the justestresentment. We are the assailants in the war, and descend into Italywith hostile standards, about to engage so much more boldly andbravely than the foe, as the confidence and courage of the assailantare greater than those of him who is defensive. Besides suffering,injury and indignity inflame and excite our minds: they first demandedme your leader for punishment, and then all of you who had laid siegeto Saguntum; and had we been given up they would have visited us withthe severest tortures. That most cruel and haughty nation considersevery thing its own, and at its own disposal; it thinks it right thatit should regulate with whom we are to have war, with whom peace: itcircumscribes and shuts us up by the boundaries of mountains andrivers, which we must not pass; and then does not adhere to thoseboundaries which it appointed. Pass not the Iberus; have nothing to dowith the Saguntines. Saguntum is on the Iberus; you must not move astep in any direction. Is it a small thing that you take away my mostancient provinces Sicily and Sardinia? will you take Spain also? andshould I withdraw thence, you will cross over into Africa--will cross,did I say? they have sent the two consuls of this year one to Africa,the other to Spain: there is nothing left to us in any quarter, exceptwhat we can assert to ourselves by arms. Those may be cowards anddastards who have something to look back upon; whom, flying throughsafe and unmolested roads, their own lands and their own country willreceive: there is a necessity for you to be brave; and since allbetween victory and death is broken off from you by inevitabledespair, either to conquer, or, if fortune should waver, to meet deathrather in battle than flight. If this be well fixed and determined inthe minds of you all, I will repeat, you have already conquered: nostronger incentive to victory has been given to man by the immortalgods."""Book 21,Chapter 45,"When the minds of the soldiers on both sides had been animated tothe contest by these exhortations, the Romans throw a bridge over theTicinus, and, for the sake of defending the bridge, erect a fort onit. The Carthaginian, while the Romans were engaged in this work,sends Maharbal with a squadron of five hundred Numidian horse, to laywaste the territories of the allies of the Roman people. He ordersthat the Gauls should be spared as much as possible, and the minds oftheir chiefs be instigated to a revolt. When the bridge was finished,the Roman army being led across into the territory of the Insubrians,took up its station five miles from Victumviae. At this place Hanniballay encamped; and having quickly recalled Maharbal and the cavalry,when he perceived that a battle was approaching, thinking that inexhorting the soldiers enough could never be spoken or addressed byway of admonition, he announces to them, when summoned to an assembly,stated rewards, in expectation of which they might fight. He promised,""that he would give them land in Italy, Africa, Spain, where each manmight choose, exempt from all burdens to the person who received it,and to his children: if any one preferred money to land, he wouldsatisfy him in silver; if any of the allies wished to become citizensof Carthage, he would grant them permission; if others chose rather toreturn home, he would lend his endeavours that they should not wishthe situation of any one of their countrymen exchanged for their own.""To the slaves also who followed their masters he promised freedom, andthat he would give two slaves in place of each of them to theirmasters. And that they might know that these promises were certain,holding in his left hand a lamb, and in his right a flint, havingprayed to Jupiter and the other gods, that, if he was false to hisword, they would thus slay him as he slew the lamb; after the prayerhe broke the skull of the sheep with the stone. Then in truth all,receiving as it were the gods as sureties, each for the fulfilment ofhis own hopes, and thinking that the only delay in obtaining theobject of their wishes arose from their not yet being engaged, withone mind and one voice demanded the battle."Book 21,Chapter 46,"By no means so great an alacrity prevailed among the Romans, who,in addition to other causes, were also alarmed by recent prodigies;for both a wolf had entered the camp, and having torn those who methim, had escaped unhurt; and a swarm of bees had settled on a treeoverhanging the general's tent. After these prodigies were expiated,Scipio having set out with his cavalry and light-armed spearmentowards the camp of the enemy, to observe from a near point theirforces, how numerous, and of what description they were, falls in withHannibal, who had himself also advanced with his cavalry to explorethe circumjacent country: neither at first perceived the other, butthe dust arising from the trampling of so many men and horses soongave the signal of approaching enemies. Both armies halted, and werepreparing themselves for battle. Scipio places his spearmen and Galliccavalry in front; the Romans and what force of allies he had with him,in reserve. Hannibal receives the horsemen who rode with the rein inthe centre, and strengthens his wings with Numidians. When the shoutwas scarcely raised, the spearmen fled among the reserve to the secondline: there was then a contest of the cavalry, for some time doubtful;but afterwards, on account of the foot soldiers, who wereintermingled, causing confusion among the horses, many of the ridersfalling off from their horses, or leaping down where they saw theirfriends surrounded and hard pressed, the battle for the most part cameto be fought on foot; until the Numidians, who were in the wings,having made a small circuit, showed themselves on the rear. That alarmdismayed the Romans, and the wound of the consul, and the danger tohis life, warded off by the interposition of his son, then justarriving at the age of puberty, augmented their fears. This youth willbe found to be the same to whom the glory of finishing this warbelongs, and to whom the name of Africanus was given, on account ofhis splendid victory over Hannibal and the Carthaginians. The flight,however, of the spearmen, whom the Numidians attacked first, was themost disorderly. The rest of the cavalry, in a close body, protecting,not only with their arms, but also with their bodies, the consul, whomthey had received into the midst of them, brought him back to the campwithout any where giving way in disorder or precipitation. Coeliusattributes the honour of saving the consul to a slave, by nation aLigurian. I indeed should rather wish that the account about the sonwas true, which also most authors have transmitted, and the report ofwhich has generally obtained credit."Book 21,Chapter 47,"This was the first battle with Hannibal; from which it clearlyappeared that the Carthaginian was superior in cavalry; and on thataccount, that open plains, such as lie between the Po and the Alps,were not suited to the Romans for carrying on the war. On thefollowing night, therefore, the soldiers being ordered to preparetheir baggage in silence, the camp broke up from the Ticinus, and theyhastened to the Po, in order that the rafts by which the consul hadformed a bridge over the river, being not yet loosened, he might leadhis forces across without disturbance or pursuit of the enemy. Theyarrived at Placentia before Hannibal had ascertained that they had setout from the Ticinus. He took, however, six hundred of those wholoitered on the farther bank, who were slowly unfastening the raft;but he was not able to pass the bridge, as the whole raft floated downthe stream as soon as the ends were unfastened. Coelius relates thatMago, with the cavalry and Spanish infantry, immediately swam theriver; and that Hannibal himself led the army across by fords higherup the Po, the elephants being opposed to the stream in a line tobreak the force of the current. These accounts can scarcely gaincredit with those who are acquainted with that river; for it isneither probable that the cavalry could bear up against the greatviolence of the stream, without losing their arms or horses, evensupposing that inflated bags of leather had transported all theSpaniards; and the fords of the Po, by which an army encumbered withbaggage could pass, must have been sought by a circuit of many days'march. Those authors are more credited by me, who relate that in thecourse of two days a place was with difficulty found fit for forming abridge of rafts across the river, and that by this way the light-armedSpanish cavalry was sent forward with Mago. Whilst Hannibal, delayingbeside the river to give audience to the embassies of the Gauls,conveys over the heavy-armed forces of infantry, in the mean timeMago and the cavalry proceed towards the enemy at Placentia one day'sjourney after crossing the river. Hannibal, a few days after,fortified his camp six miles from Placentia, and on the following day,having drawn up his line of battle in sight of the enemy, gave them anopportunity of fighting."Book 21,Chapter 48,"On the following night a slaughter was made in the Roman camp bythe auxiliary Gauls, which appeared greater from the tumult than itproved in reality. Two thousand infantry and two hundred horse, havingkilled the guards at the gates, desert to Hannibal; whom theCarthaginians having addressed kindly, and excited by the hope ofgreat rewards, sent each to several states to gain over the minds oftheir countrymen. Scipio, thinking that that slaughter was a signalfor the revolt of all the Gauls, and that, contaminated with the guiltof that affair, they would rush to arms as if a frenzy had been sentamong them, though he was still suffering severely from his wound, yetsetting out for the river Trebia at the fourth watch of the followingnight with his army in silence, he removes his camp to higher groundand hills more embarrassing to the cavalry. He escaped observationless than at the Ticinus: and Hannibal, having despatched first theNumidians and then all the cavalry, would have thrown the rear atleast into great confusion, had not the Numidians, through anxiety forbooty, turned aside into the deserted Roman camp. There whilst,closely examining every part of the camp, they waste time, with nosufficient reward for the delay, the enemy escaped out of their hands;and when they saw the Romans already across the Trebia, and measuringout their camp, they kill a few of the loiterers intercepted on thatside of the river. Scipio being unable to endure any longer theirritation of his wound, caused by the roughness of the road, andthinking that he ought to wait for his colleague, (for he had nowheard that he was recalled from Sicily,) fortified a space of chosenground, which, adjoining the river, seemed safest for a stationarycamp. When Hannibal had encamped not far from thence, being as muchelated with the victory of his cavalry, as anxious on account of thescarcity which every day assailed him more severely, marching as hedid through the territory of the enemy, and supplies being no whereprovided, he sends to the village of Clastidium, where the Romans hadcollected a great stock of corn. There, whilst they were preparing foran assault, a hope of the town being betrayed to them was held out:Dasius, a Brundusian, the governor of the garrison, having beencorrupted for four hundred pieces of gold, (no great bribe truly,)Clastidium is surrendered to Hannibal. It served as a granary for theCarthaginians while they lay at the Trebia. No cruelty was usedtowards the prisoners of the surrendered garrison, in order that acharacter for clemency might be acquired at the commencement of hisproceedings."Book 21,Chapter 49,"While the war by land was at a stand beside the Trebia, in themean time operations went on by land and sea around Sicily and theislands adjacent to Italy, both under Sempronius the consul, andbefore his arrival. Twenty quinqueremes, with a thousand armed men,having been sent by the Carthaginians to lay waste the coast of Italy,nine reached the Liparae, eight the island of Vulcan, and three thetide drove into the strait. On these being seen from Messana, twelveships sent out by Hiero king of Syracuse, who then happened to be atMessana, waiting for the Roman consul, brought back into the port ofMessana the ships taken without any resistance. It was discovered fromthe prisoners that, besides the twenty ships, to which fleet theybelonged, and which had been despatched against Italy, thirty-fiveother quinqueremes were directing their course to Sicily, in order togain over their ancient allies: that their main object was to gainpossession of Lilybaeum, and they believed that that fleet had beendriven to the islands Aegates by the same storm by which theythemselves had been dispersed. The king writes these tidings,according as they had been received, to Marcus Aemilius the praetor,whose province Sicily was, and advises him to occupy Lilybaeum with astrong garrison. Immediately the lieutenants, generals, and tribunes,with the praetor, were despatched to the different states, in orderthat they might keep their men on vigilant guard; above all things itwas commanded, that Lilybaeum should be secured: an edict having beenput forth that, in addition to such warlike preparations, the crewsshould carry down to their ships dressed provisions for ten days, sothat no one when the signal was given might delay in embarking; andthat those who were stationed along the whole coast should look outfrom their watch-towers for the approaching fleet of the enemy. TheCarthaginians, therefore, though they had purposely slackened thecourse of their ships, so that they might reach Lilybaeum just beforedaybreak, were descried before their arrival, because both the moonshone all night, and they came with their sails set up. Immediatelythe signal was given from the watch-towers, and the summons to armswas shouted through the town, and they embarked in the ships: part ofthe soldiers were left on the walls and at the stations of the gates,and part went on board the fleet. The Carthaginians, because theyperceived that they would not have to do with an unprepared enemy,kept back from the harbour till daylight, that interval being spent intaking down their rigging and getting ready the fleet for action. Whenthe light appeared, they withdrew their fleet into the open sea, thatthere might be room for the battle, and that the ships of the enemymight have a free egress from the harbour. Nor did the Romans declinethe conflict, being emboldened both by the recollection of theexploits they had performed near that very spot, and by the numbersand valour of their soldiers."Book 21,Chapter 50,"When they had advanced into the open sea, the Romans wished tocome to close fight, and to make a trial of strength hand to hand. TheCarthaginians, on the contrary, eluded them, and sought to maintainthe fight by art, not by force, and to make it a battle of shipsrather than of men and arms: for though they had their fleetabundantly supplied with mariners, yet it was deficient in soldiers;and when a ship was grappled, a very unequal number of armed menfought on board of it. When this was observed, their numbers increasedthe courage of the Romans, and their inferiority of force diminishedthat of the others. Seven Carthaginian ships were immediatelysurrounded; the rest took to flight: one thousand seven hundredsoldiers and mariners were captured in the ships, and among them werethree noble Carthaginians. The Roman fleet returned without loss tothe harbour, only one ship being pierced, and even that also broughtback into port. After this engagement, before those at Messana wereaware of its occurrence, Titus Sempronius the consul arrived atMessana. As he entered the strait, king Hiero led out a fleet fullyequipped to meet him; and having passed from the royal ship into thatof the general, he congratulated him on having arrived safe with hisarmy and fleet, and prayed that his expedition to Sicily might beprosperous and successful. He then laid before him the state of theisland and the designs of the Carthaginians, and promised that withthe same spirit with which he had in his youth assisted the Romansduring the former war, he would now assist them in his old age; thathe would gratuitously furnish supplies of corn and clothing to thelegions and naval crews of the consul; adding, that great dangerthreatened Lilybaeum and the maritime states, and that a change ofaffairs would be acceptable to some of them. For these reasons itappeared to the consul that he ought to make no delay, but to repairto Lilybaeum with his fleet. The king and the royal squadron set outalong with him, and on their passage they heard that a battle had beenfought at Lilybaeum, and that the enemy's ships had been scattered andtaken."Book 21,Chapter 51,"The consul having dismissed Hiero with the royal fleet, and leftthe praetor to defend the coast of Sicily, passed over himself fromLilybaeum to the island Melita, which was held in possession by theCarthaginians. On his arrival, Hamilcar, the son of Gisgo, thecommander of the garrison, with little less than two thousandsoldiers, together with the town and the island, are delivered up tohim: thence, after a few days, he returned to Lilybaeum, and theprisoners taken, both by the consul and the praetor, excepting thoseillustrious for their rank, were publicly sold. When the consulconsidered that Sicily was sufficiently safe on that side, he crossedover to the islands of Vulcan, because there was a report that theCarthaginian fleet was stationed there: but not one of the enemy wasdiscovered about those islands. They had already, as it happened,passed over to ravage the coast of Italy, and having laid waste theterritory of Vibo, were also threatening the city. The descent made bythe enemy on the Vibonensian territory is announced to the consul ashe was returning to Sicily: and letters were delivered to him whichhad been sent by the senate, about the passage of Hannibal into Italy,commanding him as soon as possible to bring assistance to hiscolleague. Perplexed with having so many anxieties at once, heimmediately sent his army, embarked in the fleet, by the upper sea toAriminum; he assigned the defence of the territory of Vibo, and thesea-coast of Italy, to Sextus Pomponius, his lieutenant-general, withtwenty-five ships of war: he made up a fleet of fifty ships for MarcusAemilius the praetor; and he himself, after the affairs of Sicily weresettled, sailing close along the coast of Italy with ten ships,arrived at Ariminum, whence, setting out with his army for the riverTrebia, he joined his colleague."Book 21,Chapter 52,"Both the consuls and all the strength of Rome being now opposed toHannibal, made it sufficiently obvious that the Roman empire couldeither be defended by those forces, or that there was no other hopeleft. Yet the one consul being dispirited by the battle of the cavalryand his own wound, wished operations to be deferred: the other havinghis spirits unsubdued, and being therefore the more impetuous,admitted no delay. The tract of country between the Trebia and the Powas then inhabited by the Gauls, who, in this contest of two verypowerful states, by a doubtful neutrality, were evidently lookingforward to the favour of the conqueror. The Romans submitted to thisconduct of the Gauls with tolerable satisfaction, provided they didnot take any active part at all; but the Carthaginian bore it withgreat discontent, giving out that he had come invited by the Gauls toset them at liberty. On account of that resentment, and in order thathe might at the same time maintain his troops from the plunder, heordered two thousand foot and a thousand horse, chiefly Numidians,with some Gauls intermixed, to lay waste all the countrystraightforward as far as the banks of the Po. The Gauls, being inwant of assistance, though they had up to this time kept theirinclinations doubtful, are forced by the authors of the injury to turnto some who would be their supporters; and having sent ambassadors tothe consul, they implore the aid of the Romans in behalf of a countrywhich was suffering for the too great fidelity of its inhabitants tothe Romans. Neither the cause nor the time of pleading it wassatisfactory to Cornelius; and the nation was suspected by him, bothon account of many treacherous actions, and though others might havebeen forgotten through length of time, on account of the recentperfidy of the Boii. Sempronius, on the contrary, thought that itwould be the strongest tie upon the fidelity of the allies, if thosewere defended who first required support. Then, while his colleaguehesitated, he sends his own cavalry, with about a thousand spearmen onfoot in their company, to protect the Gallic territory beyond theTrebia. These, when they had unexpectedly attacked the enemy whilescattered and disordered, and for the most part encumbered with booty,caused great terror, slaughter, and flight, even as far as the campand outposts of the enemy; whence being repulsed by the numbers thatpoured out, they again renewed the fight with the assistance of theirown party. Then pursuing and retreating in doubtful battle, thoughthey left it at last equal, yet the fame of the victory was more withthe Romans than the enemy."Book 21,Chapter 53,"But to no one did it appear more important and just than to theconsul himself. He was transported with joy ""that he had conqueredwith that part of the forces with which the other consul had beendefeated; that the spirits of the soldiers were restored and revived;that there was no one, except his colleague, who would wish anengagement delayed; and that he, suffering more from disease of mindthan body, shuddered, through recollection of his wound, at arms andbattle. But others ought not to sink into decrepitude together with asick man. For why should there be any longer protraction or waste oftime? What third consul, what other army did they wait for? The campof the Carthaginians was in Italy, and almost in sight of the city. Itwas not Sicily and Sardinia, which had been taken from them whenvanquished, nor Spain on this side of the Iberus, that was theirobject, but that the Romans should be driven from the land of theirfathers, and the soil in which they were born. How deeply,"" hecontinued, ""would our fathers groan, who were wont to wage war aroundthe walls of Carthage, if they should see us their offspring, twoconsuls and two consular armies, trembling within our camps in theheart of Italy, while a Carthaginian had made himself master of allthe country between the Alps and the Apennine!"" Such discourses did hehold while sitting beside his sick colleague, and also at thehead-quarters, almost in the manner of an harangue. The approachingperiod of the elections also stimulated him, lest the war should beprotracted till the new consuls were chosen, and the opportunity ofturning all the glory to himself, while his colleague lay sick. Heorders the soldiers, therefore, Cornelius in vain attempting todissuade him, to get ready for an immediate engagement. Hannibal, ashe saw what conduct would be best for the enemy, had scarce at firstany hope that the consuls would do any thing rashly or imprudently,but when he discovered that the disposition of the one, first knownfrom report, and afterwards from experience, was ardent and impetuous,and believed that it had been rendered still more impetuous by thesuccessful engagement with his predatory troops, he did not doubt thatan opportunity of action was near at hand. He was anxious and watchfulnot to omit this opportunity, while the troops of the enemy were raw,while his wound rendered the better of the two commanders useless, andwhile the spirits of the Gauls were fresh; of whom he knew that agreat number would follow him with the greater reluctance the fartherthey were drawn away from home. When, for these and similar reasons,he hoped that an engagement was near and desired to make the attackhimself, if there should be any delay; and when the Gauls, who werethe safer spies to ascertain what he wished, as they served in bothcamps, had brought intelligence that the Romans were prepared forbattle, the Carthaginian began to look about for a place for anambuscade."Book 21,Chapter 54,"Between the armies was a rivulet, bordered on each side with veryhigh banks, and covered around with marshy plants, and with thebrushwood and brambles with which uncultivated places are generallyoverspread; and when, riding around it, he had, with his own eyes,thoroughly reconnoitred a place which was sufficient to afford acovert even for cavalry, he said to Mago his brother: ""This will bethe place which you must occupy. Choose out of all the infantry andcavalry a hundred men of each, with whom come to me at the firstwatch. Now is the time to refresh their bodies."" The council was thusdismissed, and in a little time Mago came forward with his chosen men.""I see,"" said Hannibal, ""the strength of the men; but that you may bestrong not only in resolution, but also in number, pick out each fromthe troops and companies nine men like yourselves: Mago will show youthe place where you are to lie in ambush. You will have an enemy whois blind to these arts of war."" A thousand horse and a thousand foot,under the command of Mago, having been thus sent off, Hannibal ordersthe Numidian cavalry to ride up, after crossing the river Trebia bybreak of day, to the gates of the enemy, and to draw them out to abattle by discharging their javelins at the guards; and then, when thefight was commenced, by retiring slowly to decoy them across theriver. These instructions were given to the Numidians: to the otherleaders of the infantry and cavalry it was commanded that they shouldorder all their men to dine; and then, under arms and with theirhorses equipped, to await the signal. Sempronius, eager for thecontest, led out, on the first tumult raised by the Numidians, all thecavalry, being full of confidence in that part of the forces; then sixthousand infantry, and lastly all his army, to the place alreadydetermined in his plan. It happened to be the winter season and asnowy day, in the region which lies between the Alps and the Apennine,and excessively cold by the proximity of rivers and marshes: besides,there was no heat in the bodies of the men and horses thus hastily ledout without having first taken food, or employed any means to keep offthe cold; and the nearer they approached to the blasts from the river,a keener degree of cold blew upon them. But when, in pursuit of theflying Numidians, they entered the water, (and it was swollen by rainin the night as high as their breasts,) then in truth the bodies ofall, on landing, were so benumbed, that they were scarcely able tohold their arms; and as the day advanced they began to grow faint,both from fatigue and hunger."Book 21,Chapter 55,"In the mean time the soldiers of Hannibal, fires having beenkindled before the tents, and oil sent through the companies to softentheir limbs, and their food having been taken at leisure, as soon asit was announced that the enemy had passed the river, seized theirarms with vigour of mind and body, and advanced to the battle.Hannibal placed before the standards the Baliares and the light-armedtroops, to the amount of nearly eight thousand men; then theheavier-armed infantry, the chief of his power and strength: on thewings he posted ten thousand horse, and on their extremities stationedthe elephants divided into two parts. The consul placed on the flanksof his infantry the cavalry, recalled by the signal for retreat, as intheir irregular pursuit of the enemy they were checked, whileunprepared, by the Numidians suddenly turning upon them. There were ofinfantry eighteen thousand Romans, twenty thousand allies of the Latinname, besides the auxiliary forces of the Cenomani, the only Gallicnation that had remained faithful: with these forces they engaged theenemy. The battle was commenced by the Baliares; whom when the legionsresisted with superior force, the light-armed troops were hastilydrawn off to the wings; which movement caused the Roman cavalry to beimmediately overpowered: for when their four thousand already withdifficulty withstood by themselves ten thousand of the enemy, thewearied, against men for the most part fresh, they were overwhelmed inaddition by a cloud as it were of javelins, discharged by theBaliares; and the elephants besides, which held a prominent positionat the extremities of the wings, (the horses being greatly terrifiednot only at their appearance, but their unusual smell,) occasionedflight to a wide extent. The battle between the infantry was equalrather in courage than strength; for the Carthaginian brought thelatter entire to the action, having a little before refreshedthemselves, while, on the contrary, the bodies of the Romans,suffering from fasting and fatigue, and stiff with cold, were quitebenumbed. They would have made a stand, however, by dint of courage,if they had only had to fight with the infantry. But both theBaliares, having beaten off the cavalry, poured darts on their flanks,and the elephants had already penetrated to the centre of the line ofthe infantry; while Mago and the Numidians, as soon as the army hadpassed their place of ambush without observing them, starting up ontheir rear, occasioned great disorder and alarm. Nevertheless, amid somany surrounding dangers, the line for some time remained unbroken,and, most contrary to the expectation of all, against the elephants.These the light infantry, posted for the purpose, turned back bythrowing their spears; and following them up when turned, pierced themunder the tail, where they received the wounds in the softest skin."Book 21,Chapter 56,"Hannibal ordered the elephants, thus thrown into disorder, andalmost driven by their terror against their own party, to be led awayfrom the centre of the line to its extremity against the auxiliaryGauls on the left wing. In an instant they occasioned unequivocalflight; and a new alarm was added to the Romans when they saw theirauxiliaries routed. About ten thousand men, therefore, as they nowwere fighting in a circle, the others being unable to escape, brokethrough the middle of the line of the Africans, which was supported bythe Gallic auxiliaries, with immense slaughter of the enemy: and sincethey neither could return to the camp, being shut out by the river,nor, on account of the heavy rain, satisfactorily determine in whatpart they should assist their friends, they proceeded by the directroad to Placentia. After this several irruptions were made in alldirections; and those who sought the river were either swallowed up inits eddies, or whilst they hesitated to enter it were cut off by theenemy. Some, who had been scattered abroad through the country intheir flight, by following the traces of the retreating army, arrivedat Placentia; others, the fear of the enemy inspired with boldness toenter the river, having crossed it, reached the camp. The rain mixedwith snow, and the intolerable severity of the cold, destroyed manymen and beasts of burden, and almost all the elephants. The riverTrebia was the termination of the Carthaginians' pursuit of the enemy;and they returned to the camp so benumbed with cold, that they couldscarcely feel joy for the victory. On the following night, therefore,though the guard of the camp and the principal part of the soldiersthat remained passed the Trebia on rafts, they either did not perceiveit, on account of the beating of the rain, or being unable to bestirthemselves, through their fatigue and wounds, pretended that they didnot perceive it; and the Carthaginians remaining quiet, the army wassilently led by the consul Scipio to Placentia, thence transportedacross the Po to Cremona, lest one colony should be too much burdenedby the winter quarters of two armies."Book 21,Chapter 57,"Such terror on account of this disaster was carried to Rome, thatthey believed that the enemy was already approaching the city withhostile standards, and that they had neither hope nor aid by whichthey might repel his attack from the gates and walls. One consulhaving been defeated at the Ticinus, the other having been recalledfrom Sicily, and now both consuls and their two consular armies havingbeen vanquished, what other commanders, what other legions were thereto be sent for? The consul Sempronius came to them whilst thusdismayed, having passed at great risk through the cavalry of theenemy, scattered in every direction in search of plunder, withcourage, rather than with any plan or hope of escaping, or of makingresistance if he should not escape it. Having held the assembly forthe election of the consuls, the only thing which was particularlywanting at present, he returned to the winter quarters. CneiusServilius and Caius Flaminius were elected consuls. But not even thewinter quarters of the Romans were undisturbed, the Numidian horseranging at large, and where the ground was impracticable for these,the Celtiberians and Lusitanians. All supplies, therefore, from everyquarter, were cut off, except such as the ships conveyed by the Po.There was a magazine near Placentia, both fortified with great careand secured by a strong garrison. In the hope of taking this fort,Hannibal having set out with the cavalry and the light-armed horse,and having attacked it by night, as he rested his main hope ofeffecting his enterprise on keeping it concealed, did not escape thenotice of the guards. Such a clamour was immediately raised, that itwas heard even at Placentia. The consul; therefore, came up with thecavalry about daybreak, having commanded the legions to follow in asquare band. In the mean time an engagement of cavalry commenced, inwhich the enemy being dismayed because Hannibal retired wounded fromthe fight, the fortress was admirably defended. After this, havingtaken rest for a few days, and before his wound was hardly as yetsufficiently healed, he sets out to lay siege to Victumviae. Thismagazine had been fortified by the Romans in the Gallic war;afterwards a mixture of inhabitants from the neighbouring statesaround had made the place populous; and at this time the terrorcreated by the devastation of the enemy had driven together to itnumbers from the country. A multitude of this description, excited bythe report of the brave defence of the fortress near Placentia, havingsnatched up their arms, went out to meet Hannibal. They engaged on theroad rather like armies in order of march than in line of battle; andsince on the one side there was nothing but a disorderly crowd, and onthe other a general confident in his soldiers, and soldiers in theirgeneral, as many as thirty-five thousand men were routed by a few. Onthe following day, a surrender having been made, they received agarrison within their walls; and being ordered to deliver up theirarms, as soon as they had obeyed the command, a signal is suddenlygiven to the victors to pillage the city, as if it had been taken bystorm; nor was any outrage, which in such cases is wont to appear towriters worthy of relation, left unperpetrated; such a specimen ofevery kind of lust, barbarity, and inhuman insolence was exhibitedtowards that unhappy people. Such were the expeditions of Hannibalduring the winter."Book 21,Chapter 58,"For a short time after, while the cold continued intolerable, restwas given to the soldiers; and having set out from his winter quarterson the first and uncertain indications of spring, he leads them intoEtruria, intending to gain that nation to his side, like the Gauls andLigurians, either by force or favour. As he was crossing theApennines, so furious a storm attacked him, that it almost surpassedthe horrors of the Alps. When the rain and wind together were drivendirectly against their faces, they at first halted, because their armsmust either be cast away, or striving to advance against the stormthey were whirled round by the hurricane, and dashed to the ground:afterwards, when it now stopped their breath, nor suffered them torespire, they sat down for a little, with their backs to the wind.Then indeed the sky resounded with loud thunder, and the lightningsflashed between its terrific peals; all, bereft of sight and hearing,stood torpid with fear. At length, when the rain had spent itself, andthe fury of the wind was on that account the more increased, it seemednecessary to pitch the camp in that very place where they had beenovertaken by the storm. But this was the beginning of their labours,as it were, afresh; for neither could they spread out nor fix anytent, nor did that which perchance had been put up remain, the windtearing through and sweeping every thing away: and soon after, whenthe water raised aloft by the wind had been frozen above the coldsummits of the mountains, it poured down such a torrent of snowy hail,that the men, casting away every thing, fell down upon their faces,rather buried under than sheltered by their coverings; and so extremean intensity of cold succeeded, that when each wished to raise andlift himself from that wretched heap of men and beasts of burden, hewas for a long time unable, because their sinews being stiffened bythe cold, they had great difficulty in bending their joints.Afterwards, when, by continually moving themselves to and fro, theysucceeded in recovering the power of motion, and regained theirspirits, and fires began to be kindled in a few places, every helplessman had recourse to the aid of others. They remained as if blockadedfor two days in that place. Many men and beasts of burden, and alsoseven elephants, of those which had remained from the battle fought atthe Trebia, were destroyed."Book 21,Chapter 59,"Having descended from the Apennines, he moved his camp backtowards Placentia, and having proceeded as far as ten miles, took uphis station. On the following day he leads out twelve thousandinfantry and five thousand cavalry against the enemy. Nor didSempronius the consul (for he had now returned from Rome) decline theengagement; and during that day three miles intervened between the twocamps. On the following day they fought with amazing courage andvarious success. At the first onset the Roman power was so superior,that they not only conquered the enemy in the regular battle, butpursued them when driven back quite into their camp, and soon afteralso assaulted it. Hannibal, having stationed a few to defend therampart and the gates, and having admitted the rest in close arrayinto the middle of the camp orders them to watch attentively thesignal for sallying out. It was now about the ninth hour of the daywhen the Roman, having fatigued his soldiers to no purpose, afterthere was no hope of gaining possession of the camp, gave the signalfor retreat; which when Hannibal heard, and saw that the attack wasslackened, and that they were retreating from the camp, instantlyhaving sent out the cavalry on the right and left against the enemy,he himself in the middle with the main force of the infantry rushedout from the camp. Seldom has there been a combat more furious, andfew would have been more remarkable for the loss on both sides, if theday had suffered it to continue for a longer time. Night broke off thebattle when raging most from the determined spirit of the combatants.The conflict therefore was more severe than the slaughter: and as itwas pretty much a drawn battle, they separated with equal loss. Onneither side fell more than six hundred infantry, and half that numberof cavalry. But the loss of the Romans was more severe thanproportionate to the number that fell, because several of equestrianrank, and five tribunes of the soldiers, and three prefects of theallies were slain. After this battle Hannibal retired to the territoryof the Ligurians, and Sempronius to Luca. Two Roman quaestors, CaiusFulvius and Lucius Lucretius, who had been treacherously intercepted,with two military tribunes and five of the equestrian order, mostlysons of senators, are delivered up to Hannibal when coming among theLigurians, in order that he might feel more convinced that the peaceand alliance with them would be binding."Book 21,Chapter 60,"While these things are transacting in Italy, Cneius CorneliusScipio having been sent into Spain with a fleet and army, when,setting out from the mouth of the Rhone, and sailing past thePyrenaean mountains, he had moored his fleet at Emporiae, having therelanded his army, and beginning with the Lacetani, he brought the wholecoast, as far as the river Iberus, under the Roman dominion, partly byrenewing the old, and partly by forming new alliances. The reputationfor clemency, acquired by these means, had influence not only with themaritime states, but now also with the more savage tribes in theinland and mountainous districts; nor was peace only effected withthem, but also an alliance of arms, and several fine cohorts ofauxiliaries were levied from their numbers. The country on this sideof the Iberus was the province of Hanno, whom Hannibal had left todefend that region. He, therefore, judging that he ought to makeopposition, before every thing was alienated from him, having pitchedhis camp in sight of the enemy, led out his forces in battle-array;nor did it appear to the Roman, that the engagement ought to bedeferred, as he knew that he must fight with Hanno and Hasdrubal, andwished rather to contend against each of them separately, than againstboth together. The conflict did not prove one of great difficulty; sixthousand of the enemy were slain, and two thousand made prisoners,together with the guard of the camp; for both the camp was stormed,and the general himself, with several of the chief officers, taken;and Scissis, a town near the camp, was also carried by assault. Butthe spoil of this town consisted of things of small value, such as thehousehold furniture used by barbarians and slaves that were worthlittle. The camp enriched the soldiers; almost all the valuableeffects, not only of that army which was conquered, but of that whichwas serving with Hannibal in Italy, having been left on this side thePyrenees, that the baggage might not be cumbrous to those who conveyedit."Book 21,Chapter 61,"Before any certain news of this disaster arrived, Hasdrubal,having passed the Iberus with eight thousand foot and a thousandhorse, intending to meet the Romans on their first approach, after heheard of the ruin of their affairs at Scissis, and the loss of thecamp, turned his route towards the sea. Not far from Tarraco, havingdespatched his cavalry in various directions, he drove to their ships,with great slaughter, and greater route, the soldiers belonging to thefleet and the mariners, while scattered and wandering through thefields (for it is usually the case that success produces negligence),but not daring to remain longer in that quarter, lest he should besurprised by Scipio, he withdrew to the other side of the Iberus. AndScipio, having quickly brought up his army on the report of freshenemies, after punishing a few captains of ships and leaving amoderate garrison at Tarraco, returned with his fleet to Emporiae. Hehad scarcely departed, when Hasdrubal came up, and having instigatedto a revolt the state of the Ilergetes, which had given hostages toScipio, he lays waste, with the youth of that very people, the landsof the faithful allies of the Romans. Scipio being thereupon rousedfrom his winter quarters, Hasdrubal again retires from in all thecountry on this side the Iberus. Scipio, when with a hostile army hehad invaded the state of the Ilergetes, forsaken by the author oftheir revolt, and having driven them all into Athanagia, which was thecapital of that nation laid siege to the city; and within a few days,having imposed the delivery of more hostages than before, and alsofined the Ilergetes in a sum of money, he received them back into hisauthority and dominion. He then proceeded against the Ausetani nearthe Iberus, who were also the allies of the Carthaginians; and havinglaid siege to their city, he cut off by an ambuscade the Lacetani,while bringing assistance by night to their neighbours, havingattacked them at a small distance from the city, as they weredesigning to enter it. As many as twelve thousand were slain; therest, nearly all without their arms, escaped home, by dispersingthrough the country in every direction. Nor did any thing else but thewinter, which was unfavourable to the besiegers, secure the besieged.The blockade continued for thirty days, during which the snow scarceever lay less deep than four feet; and it had covered to such a degreethe sheds and mantelets of the Romans, that it alone served as adefence when fire was frequently thrown on them by the enemy. At last,when Amusitus, their leader, had fled to Hasdrubal, they aresurrendered, on condition of paying twenty talents of silver. Theythen returned into winter quarters at Tarraco."Book 21,Chapter 62,"At Rome during this winter many prodigies either occurred about thecity, or, as usually happens when the minds of men are once inclinedto superstition, many were reported and readily believed; among whichit was said that an infant of good family, only six months old, hadcalled out ""Io triumphe"" in the herb market: that in the cattle marketan ox had of his own accord ascended to the third story, and thatthence, being frightened by the noise of the inhabitants, had flunghimself down; that the appearance of ships had been brightly visiblein the sky, and that the temple of Hope in the herb market had beenstruck by lightning; that the spear at Lanuvium had shaken itself;that a crow had flown down into the temple of Juno and alighted on thevery couch; that in the territory of Amiternum figures resembling mendressed in white raiment had been seen in several places at adistance, but had not come close to any one; that in Picenum it hadrained stones; that at Caere the tablets for divination had beenlessened in size; and that in Gaul a wolf had snatched out the swordfrom the scabbard of a soldier on guard, and carried it off. Onaccount of the other prodigies the decemvirs were ordered to consultthe books; but on account of its having rained stones in Picenum thefestival of nine days was proclaimed, and almost all the state wasoccupied in expiating the rest, from time to time. First of all thecity was purified, and victims of the greater kind were sacrificed tothose gods to whom they were directed to be offered; and a gift offorty pounds' weight of gold was carried to the temple of Juno atLanuvium; and the matrons dedicated a brazen statue to Juno on theAventine; and a lectisternium was ordered at Caere, where the tabletsfor divination had diminished; and a supplication to Fortune atAlgidum; at Rome also a lectisternium was ordered to Youth, and asupplication at the temple of Hercules, first by individuals named andafterwards by the whole people at all the shrines; five greatervictims were offered to Genius; and Caius Atilius Serranus the praetorwas ordered to make certain vows if the republic should remain in thesame state for ten years. These things, thus expiated and vowedaccording to the Sibylline books, relieved, in a great degree, thepublic mind from superstitious fears."Book 21,Chapter 63,"Flaminius, one of the consuls elect, to whom the legions whichwere wintering at Placentia had fallen by lot, sent an edict andletter to the consul, desiring that those forces should be ready incamp at Ariminum on the ides of March. He had a design to enter on theconsulship in his province, recollecting his old contests with thefathers, which he had waged with them when tribune of the people, andafterwards when consul, first about his election to the office, whichwas annulled, and then about a triumph. He was also odious to thefathers on account of a new law which Quintus Claudius, tribune of thepeople, had carried against the senate, Caius Flaminius alone of thatbody assisting him, that no senator, or he who had been father of asenator, should possess a ship fit for sea service, containing morethan three hundred amphorae. This size was considered sufficient forconveying the produce of their lands: all traffic appeared unbecominga senator. This contest, maintained with the warmest opposition,procured the hatred of the nobility to Flaminius, the advocate of thelaw; but the favour of the people, and afterwards a second consulship.For these reasons, thinking that they would detain him in the city byfalsifying the auspices, by the delay of the Latin festival, and otherhinderances to which a consul was liable, he pretended a journey, and,while yet in a private capacity, departed secretly to his province.This proceeding, when it was made public, excited new and additionalanger in the senators, who were before irritated against him. Theysaid, ""That Caius Flaminius waged war not only with the senate, butnow with the immortal gods; that having been formerly made consulwithout the proper auspices, he had disobeyed both gods and menrecalling him from the very field of battle; and now, throughconsciousness of their having been dishonoured, had shunned theCapitol and the customary offering of vows, that he might not on theday of entering his office approach the temple of Jupiter, the bestand greatest of gods; he might not see and consult the senate, himselfhated by it, as it was hateful to him alone; that he might notproclaim the Latin festival, or perform on the Alban mount thecustomary rights to Jupiter Latiaris; that he might not, under thedirection of the auspices, go up to the Capitol to recite his vows,and thence, attended by the lictors, proceed to his province in thegarb of a general; but that he had set off, like some camp boy,without his insignia, without the lictors, in secrecy and stealth,just as if he had been quitting his country to go into banishment; asif forsooth he would enter his office more consistently with thedignity of the consul at Ariminum than Rome, and assume the robe ofoffice in a public inn better than before his own household gods.""--itwas unanimously resolved that he, should be recalled and brought back,and be constrained to perform in person every duty to gods and menbefore he went to the army and the province. Quintus Terentius andMarcus Antistius having set out on this embassy, (for it was decreedthat ambassadors should be sent,) prevailed with him in no degree morethan the letter sent by the senate in his former consulship. A fewdays after he entered on his office, and as he was sacrificing a calf,after being struck, having broken away from the hands of theministers, sprinkled several of the bystanders with its blood. Flightand disorder ensued, to a still greater degree at a distance amongthose who were ignorant what was the cause of the alarm. Thiscircumstance was regarded by most persons as an omen of great terror.Having then received two legions from Sempronius, the consul of theformer year, and two from Caius Atilius, the praetor, the army beganto be led into Etruria, through the passes of the Apennines."Book 22,Chapter 1,"Spring was now at hand, when Hannibal quitted his winter quarters,having both attempted in vain to cross the Apennines, from theintolerable cold, and having remained with great danger and alarm. TheGauls, whom the hope of plunder and spoil had collected, when, insteadof being themselves engaged in carrying and driving away booty fromthe lands of others, they saw their own lands made the seat of war andburdened by the wintering of the armies of both forces, turned theirhatred back again from the Romans to Hannibal; and though plots werefrequently concerted against him by their chieftains, he was preservedby the treachery they manifested towards each other; disclosing theirconspiracy with the same inconstancy with which they had conspired;and by changing sometimes his dress, at other times the fashion of hishair, he protected himself from treachery by deception. However, thisfear was the cause of his more speedily quitting his winter quarters.Meanwhile Cneius Servilius, the consul, entered upon his office atRome, on the ides of March. There, when he had consulted the senate onthe state of the republic in general, the indignation againstFlaminius was rekindled. They said ""that they had created indeed twoconsuls, that they had but one; for what regular authority had theother, or what auspices? That their magistrates took these with themfrom home, from the tutelar deities of themselves and the state, afterthe celebration of the Latin holidays; the sacrifice upon the mountainbeing completed, and the vows duly offered up in the Capitol: thatneither could an unofficial individual take the auspices, nor couldone who had gone from home without them, take them new, and for thefirst time, in a foreign soil."" Prodigies announced from many placesat the same time, augmented the terror: in Sicily, that several dartsbelonging to the soldiers had taken fire; and in Sardinia, that thestaff of a horseman, who was going his rounds upon a wall, took fireas he held it in his hand; that the shores had blazed with frequentfires; that two shields had sweated blood at Praeneste; that redhotstones had fallen from the heavens at Arpi; that shields were seen inthe heavens, and the sun fighting with the moon, at Capena; that twomoons rose in the day-time; that the waters of Caere had flowed mixedwith blood; and that even the fountain of Hercules had flowedsprinkled with spots of blood. In the territory of Antium, that bloodyears of corn had fallen into the basket as they were reaping. AtFalerii, that the heavens appeared cleft as if with a great chasm;and, that where it had opened, a vast light had shone forth; that theprophetic tablets had spontaneously become less; and that one hadfallen out thus inscribed, ""Mars shakes his spear."" During the sametime, that the statue of Mars at Rome, on the Appian way, had sweatedat the sight of images of wolves. At Capua that there had been theappearance of the heavens being on fire, and of the moon as fallingamidst rain. After these, credence was given to prodigies of lessmagnitude: that the goats of certain persons had borne wool; that ahen had changed herself into a cock; and a cock into a hen: thesethings having been laid before the senate as reported, the authorsbeing conducted into the senate-house, the consul took the sense ofthe fathers on religious affairs. It was decreed that those prodigiesshould be expiated, partly with full-grown, partly with suckingvictims; and that a supplication should be made at every shrine forthe space of three days; that the other things should be doneaccordingly as the gods should declare in their oracles to beagreeable to their will when the decemviri had examined the books. Bythe advice of the decemviri it was decreed, first, that a goldenthunderbolt of fifty pounds' weight should be made as an offering toJupiter; that offerings of silver should be presented to Juno andMinerva; that sacrifices of full-grown victims should be offered toJuno Regina on the Aventine; and to Juno Sospita at Lanuvium; that thematrons, contributing as much money as might be convenient to each,should carry it to the Aventine, as a present to Juno Regina; and thata lectisternium should be celebrated. Moreover, that the veryfreed-women should, according to their means, contribute money fromwhich a present might be made to Feronia. When these things were done,the decemviri sacrificed with the larger victims in the forum atArdea. Lastly, it being now the month of December, a sacrifice wasmade at the temple of Saturn at Rome, and a lectisternium ordered, inwhich senators prepared the couch and a public banquet. Proclamationwas made through the city, that the Saturnalia should be kept for aday and a night; and the people were commanded to account that day asa holiday, and observe it for ever."Book 22,Chapter 2,"While the consul employs himself at Rome in appeasing the gods andholding the levy, Hannibal, setting out from his winter quarters,because it was reported that the consul Flaminius had now arrived atArretium, although a longer but more commodious route was pointed outto him, takes the nearer road through a marsh where the Arno had, morethan usual, overflowed its banks. He ordered the Spaniards andAfricans (in these lay the strength of his veteran army) to lead,their own baggage being intermixed with them, lest, being compelled tohalt any where, they should want what might be necessary for theiruse: the Gauls he ordered to go next, that they might form the middleof the marching body; the cavalry to march in the rear: next, Magowith the light-armed Numidians to keep the army together, particularlycoercing the Gauls, if, fatigued with exertion and the length of themarch, as that nation is wanting in vigour for such exertions, theyshould fall away or halt. The van still followed the standardswherever the guides did but lead them, through the exceeding deep andalmost fathomless eddies of the river, nearly swallowed up in mud, andplunging themselves in. The Gauls could neither support themselveswhen fallen, nor raise themselves from the eddies. Nor did theysustain their bodies with spirit, nor their minds with hope; somescarce dragging on their wearied limbs; others dying where they hadonce fallen, their spirits being subdued with fatigue, among thebeasts which themselves also lay prostrate in every place. But chieflywatching wore them out, endured now for four days and three nights.When, the water covering every place, not a dry spot could be foundwhere they might stretch their weary bodies, they laid themselves downupon their baggage, thrown in heaps into the waters. Piles of beasts,which lay every where through the whole route, afforded a necessarybed for temporary repose to those seeking any place which was notunder water. Hannibal himself, riding on the only remaining elephant,to be the higher from the water, contracted a disorder in his eyes, atfirst from the unwholesomeness of the vernal air, which is attendedwith transitions from heat to cold; and at length from watching,nocturnal damps, the marshy atmosphere disordering his head, andbecause he had neither opportunity nor leisure for remedies, loses oneof them."Book 22,Chapter 3,"Many men and cattle having been lost thus wretchedly, when atlength he had emerged from the marshes, he pitched his camp as soon ashe could on dry ground. And here he received information, through thescouts sent in advance, that the Roman army was round the walls ofArretium. Next the plans and temper of the consul, the situation ofthe country, the roads, the sources from which provisions might beobtained, and whatever else it was useful to know; all these things heascertained by the most diligent inquiry. The country was among themost fertile of Italy, the plain of Etruria, between Faesulae andArretium, abundant in its supply of corn, cattle, and every otherrequisite. The consul was haughty from his former consulship, and feltno proper degree of reverence not only for the laws and the majesty ofthe fathers, but even for the gods. This temerity, inherent in hisnature, fortune had fostered by a career of prosperity and success incivil and military affairs. Thus it was sufficiently evident that,heedless of gods and men, he would act in all cases with presumptionand precipitation; and, that he might fall the more readily into theerrors natural to him, the Carthaginian begins to fret and irritatehim; and leaving the enemy on his left, he takes the road to Faesulae,and marching through the centre of Etruria, with intent to plunder, heexhibits to the consul, in the distance, the greatest devastation hecould with fires and slaughters. Flaminius, who would not have restedeven if the enemy had remained quiet; then, indeed, when he saw theproperty of the allies driven and carried away almost before his eyes,considering that it reflected disgrace upon him that the Carthaginiannow roaming at large through the heart of Italy, and marching withoutresistance to storm the very walls of Rome, though every other personin the council advised safe rather than showy measures, urging that heshould wait for his colleague, in order that, joining their armies,they might carry on the war with united courage and counsels; andthat, meanwhile, the enemy should be prevented from his unrestrainedfreedom in plundering by the cavalry and the light-armed auxiliaries;in a fury hurried out of the council, and at once gave out the signalfor marching and for battle. ""Nay, rather,"" says he, ""let him bebefore the walls of Arretium, for here is our country, here ourhousehold gods. Let Hannibal, slipping through our fingers, wasteItaly through and through; and, ravaging and burning every thing, lethim arrive at the walls of Rome; let us move hence till the fathersshall have summoned Flaminius from Arretium, as they did Camillus ofold from Veii."" While reproaching them thus, and in the act ofordering the standards to be speedily pulled up, when he had mountedupon his horse, the animal fell suddenly, and threw the unseatedconsul over his head. All the bystanders being alarmed at this as anunhappy omen in the commencement of the affair, in addition word isbrought, that the standard could not be pulled up, though, thestandard-bearer strove with all his force. Flaminius, turning to themessenger, says, ""Do you bring, too, letters from the senate,forbidding me to act. Go, tell them to dig up the standard, if,through fear, their hands are so benumbed that they cannot pluck itup."" Then the army began to march; the chief officers, besides thatthey dissented from the plan, being terrified by the twofold prodigy;while the soldiery in general were elated by the confidence of theirleader, since they regarded merely the hope he entertained, and notthe reasons of the hope."Book 22,Chapter 4,"Hannibal lays waste the country between the city Cortona and thelake Trasimenus, with all the devastation of war, the more toexasperate the enemy to revenge the injuries inflicted on his allies.They had now reached a place formed by nature for an ambuscade, wherethe Trasimenus comes nearest to the mountains of Cortona. A verynarrow passage only intervenes, as though room enough just for thatpurpose had been left designedly; after that a somewhat wider plainopens itself, and then some hills rise up. On these he pitches hiscamp, in full view, where he himself with his Spaniards and Africansonly might be posted. The Baliares and his other light troops he leadsround the mountains; his cavalry he posts at the very entrance of thedefile, some eminences conveniently concealing them; in order thatwhen the Romans had entered, the cavalry advancing, every place mightbe enclosed by the lake and the mountains. Flaminius, passing thedefiles before it was quite daylight, without reconnoitering, thoughhe had arrived at the lake the preceding day at sunset, when thetroops began to be spread into the wider plain, saw that part only ofthe enemy which was opposite to him; the ambuscade in his rear andoverhead escaped his notice. And when the Carthaginian had his enemyenclosed by the lake and mountains, and surrounded by his troops, hegives the signal to all to make a simultaneous charge; and eachrunning down the nearest way, the suddenness and unexpectedness of theevent was increased to the Romans by a mist rising from the lake,which had settled thicker on the plain than on the mountains; and thusthe troops of the enemy ran down from the various eminences,sufficiently well discerning each other, and therefore with thegreater regularity. A shout being raised on all sides, the Roman foundhimself surrounded before he could well see the enemy; and the attackon the front and flank had commenced ere his line could be wellformed, his arms prepared for action, or his swords unsheathed."Book 22,Chapter 5,"The consul, while all were panic-struck, himself sufficientlyundaunted though in so perilous a case, marshals, as well as the timeand place permitted, the lines which were thrown into confusion byeach man's turning himself towards the various shouts; and wherever hecould approach or be heard exhorts them, and bids them stand andfight: for that they could not escape thence by vows and prayers tothe gods but by exertion and valour; that a way was sometimes openedby the sword through the midst of marshalled armies, and thatgenerally the less the fear the less the danger. However, from thenoise and tumult, neither his advice nor command could be caught; andso far were the soldiers from knowing their own standards, and ranks,and position, that they had scarce sufficient courage to take up armsand make them ready for battle; and certain of them were surprisedbefore they could prepare them, being burdened rather than protectedby them; while in so great darkness there was more use of ears than ofeyes. They turned their faces and eyes in every direction towards thegroans of the wounded, the sounds of blows upon the body or arms, andthe mingled clamours of the menacing and the affrighted. Some, as theywere making their escape, were stopped, having encountered a body ofmen engaged in fight; and bands of fugitives returning to the battle,diverted others. After charges had been attempted unsuccessfully inevery direction, and on their flanks the mountains and the lake, onthe front and rear the lines of the enemy enclosed them, when it wasevident that there was no hope of safety but in the right hand and thesword; then each man became to himself a leader, and encourager toaction; and an entirely new contest arose, not a regular line, withprincipes, hastati, and triarii; nor of such a sort as that thevanguard should fight before the standards, and the rest of the troopsbehind them; nor such that each soldier should be in his own legion,cohort, or company: chance collects them into bands; and each man'sown will assigned to him his post, whether to fight in front or rear;and so great was the ardour of the conflict, so intent were theirminds upon the battle, that not one of the combatants felt anearthquake which threw down large portions of many of the cities ofItaly, turned rivers from their rapid courses, carried the sea up intorivers, and levelled mountains with a tremendous crash."Book 22,Chapter 6,"The battle was continued near three hours, and in every quarterwith fierceness; around the consul, however, it was still hotter andmore determined. Both the strongest of the troops, and himself too,promptly brought assistance wherever he perceived his men hard pressedand distressed. But, distinguished by his armour, the enemy attackedhim with the utmost vigour, while his countrymen defended him; untilan Insubrian horseman, named Ducarius, knowing him also by his face,says to his countrymen, ""Lo, this is the consul who slew our legionsand laid waste our fields and city. Now will I offer this victim tothe shades of my countrymen, miserably slain;"" and putting spurs tohis horse, he rushes through a very dense body of the enemy; and firstslaying his armour-bearer, who had opposed himself to his attack as heapproached, ran the consul through with his lance; the triarii,opposing their shields, kept him off when seeking to despoil him. Thenfirst the flight of a great number began; and now neither the lake northe mountains obstructed their hurried retreat; they run through allplaces, confined and precipitous, as though they were blind; and armsand men are tumbled one upon another. A great many, when thereremained no more space to run, advancing into the water through thefirst shallows of the lake, plunge in, as far as they could standabove it with their heads and shoulders. Some there were whominconsiderate fear induced to try to escape even by swimming; but asthat attempt was inordinate and hopeless, they were either overwhelmedin the deep water, their courage failing, or, wearied to no purpose,made their way back, with extreme difficulty, to the shallows; andthere were cut up on all hands by the cavalry of the enemy, which hadentered the water. Near upon six thousand of the foremost body havinggallantly forced their way through the opposing enemy, entirelyunacquainted with what was occurring in their rear, escaped from thedefile; and having halted on a certain rising ground, and hearing onlythe shouting and clashing of arms, they could not know nor discern, byreason of the mist, what was the fortune of the battle. At length, theaffair being decided, when the mist, dispelled by the increasing heatof the sun, had cleared the atmosphere, then, in the clear light, themountains and plains showed their ruin and the Roman army miserablydestroyed; and thus, lest, being descried at a distance, the cavalryshould be sent against them, hastily snatching up their standards,they hurried away with all possible expedition. On the following day,when in addition to their extreme sufferings in other respects, faminealso was at hand, Maharbal, who had followed them during the nightwith the whole body of cavalry, pledging his honour that he would letthem depart with single garments, if they would deliver up their arms,they surrendered themselves; which promise was kept by Hannibal withPunic fidelity, and he threw them all into chains."Book 22,Chapter 7,"This is the celebrated battle at the Trasimenus, and recorded amongthe few disasters of the Roman people. Fifteen thousand Romans wereslain in the battle. Ten thousand, who had been scattered in theflight through all Etruria, returned to the city by different roads.One thousand five hundred of the enemy perished in the battle; many onboth sides died afterwards of their wounds. The carnage on both sidesis related, by some authors, to have been many times greater. I,besides that I would relate nothing drawn from a worthless source, towhich the minds of historians generally incline too much, have as mychief authority Fabius, who was contemporary with the events of thiswar. Such of the captives as belonged to the Latin confederacy beingdismissed without ransom, and the Romans thrown into chains, Hannibalordered the bodies of his own men to be gathered from the heaps of theenemy, and buried: the body of Flaminius too, which was searched forwith great diligence for burial, he could not find. On the firstintelligence of this defeat at Rome, a concourse of the people,dismayed and terrified, took place in the forum. The matrons,wandering through the streets, ask all they meet, what sudden disasterwas reported? what was the fate of the army? And when the multitude,like a full assembly, having directed their course to the comitium andsenate-house, were calling upon the magistrates, at length, a littlebefore sunset, Marcus Pomponius, the praetor, declares, ""We have beendefeated in a great battle;"" and though nothing more definite washeard from him, yet, full of the rumours which they had caught onefrom another, they carry back to their homes intelligence, that theconsul, with a great part of his troops, was slain; that a few onlysurvived, and these either widely dispersed in flight through Etruria,or else captured by the enemy. As many as had been the calamities ofthe vanquished army, into so many anxieties were the minds of thosedistracted whose relations had served under Flaminius, and who wereuninformed of what had been the fate of their friends, nor does anyone know certainly what he should either hope or fear. During the nextand several successive days, a greater number of women almost than menstood at the gates, waiting either for some one of their friends orfor intelligence of them, surrounding and earnestly interrogatingthose they met: nor could they be torn away from those they knewespecially, until they had regularly inquired into every thing. Thenas they retired from the informants you might discern their variousexpressions of countenance according as intelligence, pleasing or sad,was announced to each; and those who congratulated or condoled ontheir return home. The joy and grief of the women were especiallymanifested. They report that one, suddenly meeting her son, who hadreturned safe, expired at the very door before his face--that another,who sat grieving at her house at the falsely reported death of herson, became a corpse, from excessive joy, at the first sight of him onhis return. The praetors detained the senators in the house forseveral days from sunrise to sunset, deliberating under whose conductand by what forces, the victorious Carthaginians could be opposed."Book 22,Chapter 8,"Before their plans were sufficiently determined another unexpecteddefeat is reported: four thousand horse, sent under the conduct of C.Centenius, propraetor, by Servilius to his colleague, were cut off byHannibal in Umbria, to which place, on hearing of the battle atTrasimenus, they had turned their course. The report of this eventvariously affected the people. Some, having their minds preoccupiedwith heavier grief, considered the recent loss of cavalry trifling, incomparison with their former losses; others did not estimate what hadoccurred by itself, but considered that, as in a body alreadylabouring under disease, a slight cause would be felt more violentlythan a more powerful one in a robust constitution, so whatever adverseevent befell the state in its then sickly and impaired condition,ought to be estimated, not by the magnitude of the event itself, butwith reference to its exhausted strength, which could endure nothingthat could oppress it. The state therefore took refuge in a remedy fora long time before neither wanted nor employed, the appointment of adictator, and because the consul was absent, by whom alone it appearedhe could be nominated, and because neither message nor letter couldeasily be sent to him through the country occupied by Punic troops,and because the people could not appoint a dictator, which had neverbeen done to that day, the people created Quintus Fabius Maximus prodictator, and Marcus Minucius Rufus master of the horse. To them thesenate assigned the task of strengthening the walls and towers of thecity, of placing guards in such quarters as seemed good, and breakingdown the bridges of the river, considering that they must now fight athome in defence of their city, since they were unable to protectItaly."Book 22,Chapter 9,"Hannibal, marching directly through Umbria, arrived at Spoletum,thence, having completely devastated the adjoining country, andcommenced an assault upon the city, having been repulsed with greatloss and conjecturing from the strength of this one colony, which hadbeen not very successfully attacked, what was the size of the city ofRome, turned aside into the territory of Picenum, which abounded notonly with every species of grain, but was stored with booty, which hisrapacious and needy troops eagerly seized. There he continued encampedfor several days, and his soldiers were refreshed, who had beenenfeebled by winter marches and marshy ground, and with a battle moresuccessful in its result than light or easy. When sufficient time forrest had been granted for soldiers delighting more in plunder anddevastation than ease and repose, setting out, he lays waste theterritories of Pretutia and Hadria, then of the Marsi, the Marrucini,and the Peligni, and the contiguous region of Apulia around Arpi andLuceria. Cneius Servilius, the consul, having fought some slightbattles with the Gauls, and taken one inconsiderable town, when heheard of the defeat of his colleague and the army, alarmed now for thewalls of the capital, marched towards the city, that he might not beabsent at so extreme a crisis. Quintus Fabius Maximus, a second timedictator, assembled the senate the very day he entered on his office;and commencing with what related to the gods, after he had distinctlyproved to the fathers, that Caius Flaminius had erred more fromneglect of the ceremonies and auspices than from temerity and want ofjudgment, and that the gods themselves should be consulted as to whatwere the expiations of their anger, he obtained a resolution that thedecemviri should be ordered to inspect the Sibylline books, which israrely decreed, except when some horrid prodigies were announced.Having inspected the prophetic books, they reported, that the vowwhich was made to Mars on account of this war, not having beenregularly fulfilled, must be performed afresh and more fully; that thegreat games must be vowed to Jupiter, temples to Venus Erycina andMens; that a supplication and lectisternium must be made, and a sacredspring vowed, if the war should proceed favourably and the statecontinue the condition it was in before the war. Since the managementof the war would occupy Fabius, the senate orders Marcus Aemilius, thepraetor, to see that all these things are done in good time, accordingto the directions of the college of pontiffs."Book 22,Chapter 10,"These decrees of the senate having been passed, Lucius CorneliusLentulus, pontifex maximus, the college of praetors consulting withhim, gives his opinion that, first of all, the people should beconsulted respecting a sacred spring: that it could not be without theorder of the people. The people having been asked according to thisform: Do ye will and order that this thing should be performed in thismanner? If the republic of the Roman people, the Quirites, shall besafe and preserved as I wish it may, from these wars for the next fiveyears, (the war which is between the Roman people and theCarthaginian, and the wars which are with the Cisalpine Gauls), theRoman people, the Quirites, shall present whatsoever the spring shallproduce from herds of swine, sheep, goats, oxen and which shall nothave been consecrated, to be sacrificed to Jupiter, from the day whichthe senate and people shall appoint. Let him who shall make anoffering do it when he please, and in what manner he please; inwhatsoever manner he does it, let it be considered duly done. If thatwhich ought to be sacrificed die, let it be unconsecrated, and let noguilt attach; if any one unwittingly wound or kill it, let it be noinjury to him; if any one shall steal it, let no guilt attach to thepeople or to him from whom it was stolen; if any one shall unwittinglyoffer it on a forbidden day, let it be esteemed duly offered; alsowhether by night or day, whether slave or free-man perform it. If thesenate and people shall order it to be offered sooner than any personshall offer it, let the people being acquitted of it be free. On thesame account great games were vowed, at an expense of three hundredand thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three _asses_and a third; moreover, it was decreed that sacrifice should be done toJupiter with three hundred oxen, to many other deities with white oxenand the other victims. The vows being duly made, a supplication wasproclaimed; and not only the inhabitants of the city went with theirwives and children, but such of the rustics also as, possessing anyproperty themselves, were interested in the welfare of the state. Thena lectisternium was celebrated for three days, the decemviri forsacred things superintending. Six couches were seen, for Jupiter andJuno one, for Neptune and Minerva another, for Mars and Venus a third,for Apollo and Diana a fourth, for Vulcan and Vesta a fifth, forMercury and Ceres a sixth. Then temples were vowed. To Venus Erycina,Quintus Fabius Maximus vowed a temple; for so it was delivered fromthe prophetic books, that he should vow it who held the highestauthority in the state. Titus Otacilius, the praetor vowed a temple toMens."Book 22,Chapter 11,"Divine things having been thus performed, the dictator then putthe question of the war and the state; with what, and how many legionsthe fathers were of opinion that the victorious enemy should beopposed. It was decreed that he should receive the army from CneiusServilius, the consul: that he should levy, moreover, from thecitizens and allies as many horse and foot as seemed good; that heshould transact and perform every thing else as he considered for thegood of the state. Fabius said he would add two legions to the army ofServilius. These were levied by the master of the horse, and wereappointed by Fabius to meet him at Tibur on a certain day. And thenhaving issued proclamation that those whose towns or castles wereunfortified should quit them and assemble in places of security; thatall the inhabitants of that tract through which Hannibal was about tomarch, should remove from the country, having first burnt theirbuildings and spoiled their fruits, that there might not be a supplyof any thing; he himself set out on the Flaminian road to meet theconsul and his army; and when he saw in the distance the marching bodyon the Tiber, near Ocriculum, and the consul with the cavalryadvancing to him, he sent a beadle to acquaint the consul that he mustmeet the dictator without the lictors. When he had obeyed his command,and their meeting had exhibited a striking display of the majesty ofthe dictatorship before the citizens and allies, who, from itsantiquity, had now almost forgotten that authority; a letter arrivedfrom the city, stating that the ships of burden, conveying provisionsfrom Ostia into Spain to the army, had been captured by theCarthaginian fleet off the port of Cossa. The consul, therefore, wasimmediately ordered to proceed to Ostia, and, having manned the shipsat Rome or Ostia with soldiers and sailors, to pursue the enemy, andprotect the coasts of Italy. Great numbers of men were levied at Rome,sons of freed-men even, who had children, and were of the militaryage, had taken the oath. Of these troops levied in the city, such aswere under thirty-five were put on board ships, the rest were left toprotect the city."Book 22,Chapter 12,"The dictator, having received the troops of the consul fromFulvius Flaccus, his lieutenant-general, marching through the Sabineterritory, arrived at Tibur on the day which he had appointed thenew-raised troops to assemble. Thence he went to Praeneste, andcutting across the country, came out in the Latin way, whence he ledhis troops towards the enemy, reconnoitering the road with the utmostdiligence; not intending to expose himself to hazard any where, exceptas far as necessity compelled him. The day he first pitched his campin sight of the enemy, not far from Arpi, the Carthaginian, withoutdelay, led out his troops, and forming his line gave an opportunity offighting: but when he found all still with the enemy, and his campfree from tumult and disorder, he returned to his camp, saying indeedtauntingly, ""That even the spirit of the Romans, inherited from Mars,was at length subdued; that they were warred down and had manifestlygiven up all claim to valour and renown:"" but burning inwardly withstifled vexation because he would have to encounter a general by nomeans like Flaminius and Sempronius; and because the Romans, then atlength schooled by their misfortunes, had sought a general a match forHannibal; and that now he had no longer to fear the headlong violence,but the deliberate prudence of the dictator. Having not yetexperienced his constancy, he began to provoke and try his temper, byfrequently shifting his camp and laying waste the territories of theallies before his eyes: and one while he withdrew out of sight atquick march, another while he halted suddenly, and concealed himselfin some winding of the road, if possible to entrap him on hisdescending into the plain. Fabius kept marching his troops along thehigh grounds, at a moderate distance from the enemy, so as neither tolet him go altogether nor yet to encounter him. The troops were keptwithin the camp, except so far as necessary wants compelled them toquit it; and fetched in food and wood not by small nor ramblingparties. An outpost of cavalry and light-armed troops, prepared andequipped for acting in cases of sudden alarm, rendered every thingsafe to their own soldiers, and dangerous to the scattered plunderersof the enemy. Nor was his whole cause committed to general hazard;while slight contests, of small importance in themselves, commenced onsafe ground, with a retreat at hand, accustomed the soldiery,terrified by their former disasters, now at length to think lessmeanly either of their prowess or good fortune. But he did not findHannibal a greater enemy to such sound measures than his master of thehorse, who was only prevented from plunging the state into ruin by hisinferiority in command. Presumptuous and precipitate in his measures,and unbridled in his tongue, first among a few, then openly andpublicly, he taunted him with being sluggish instead of patient,spiritless instead of cautious; falsely imputing to him those viceswhich bordered on his virtues; and raised himself by means ofdepressing his superiors, which, though a most iniquitous practice,has become more general from the too great successes of many."Book 22,Chapter 13,"Hannibal crosses over from the Hirpini into Samnium; lays wastethe territory of Beneventum; takes the town of Telesia; and purposelyirritates the dictator, if perchance he could draw him down to abattle on the plain, exasperated by so many indignities and disastersinflicted on his allies. Among the multitude of allies of Italianextraction, who had been captured by Hannibal at the Trasimenus, anddismissed, were three Campanian horsemen, who had even at that timebeen bribed by many presents and promises from Hannibal to win overthe affections of their countrymen to him. These, bringing him wordthat he would have an opportunity of getting possession of Capua, ifhe brought his army into the neighbourhood in Campania, inducedHannibal to quit Samnium for Campania; though he hesitated,fluctuating between confidence and distrust, as the affair was of moreimportance than the authorities. He dismissed them, repeatedlycharging them to confirm their promises by acts, and ordering them toreturn with a greater number, and some of their leading men. Hannibalhimself orders his guide to conduct him into the territory of Casinum,being certified by persons acquainted with the country, that if heseized that pass he would deprive the Romans of a passage by whichthey might get out to the assistance of their allies. But his Punicaccent, ill adapted to the pronunciation of Latin names, caused theguide to understand Casilinum, instead of Casinum; and leaving hisformer course, he descends through the territory of Allifae, Calatia,and Cales, into the plain of Stella, where, seeing the countryenclosed on all sides by mountains and rivers, he calls the guide tohim, and asks him where in the world he was? when he replied, that onthat day he would lodge at Casilinum: then at length the error wasdiscovered, and that Casinum lay at a great distance in anotherdirection. Having scourged the guide with rods and crucified him, inorder to strike terror into all others, he fortified a camp, and sentMaharbal with the cavalry into the Falernian territory to pillage.This depredation reached as far as the waters of Sinuessa; theNumidians caused destruction to a vast extent, but flight andconsternation through a still wider space. Yet not even the terror ofthese things, when all around was consuming in the flames of war,could shake the fidelity of the allies; for this manifest reason,because they lived under a temperate and mild government: nor werethey unwilling to submit to those who were superior to them, which isthe only bond of fidelity."Book 22,Chapter 14,"But when the enemy's camp was pitched on the Vulturnus, and themost delightful country in Italy was being consumed by fire, and thefarm-houses, on all hands, were smoking from the flames, whilst Fabiusled his troops along the heights of Mount Massicus, then the strifehad nearly been kindled anew, for they had been quiet for a few days,because, as the army had marched quicker than usual, they had supposedthat the object of this haste was to save Campania from devastation;but when they arrived at the extreme ridge of Mount Massicus, and theenemy appeared under their eyes, burning the houses of the Falernianterritory, and of the settlers of Sinuessa, and no mention made ofbattle, Minucius exclaims, ""Are we come here to see our alliesbutchered, and their property burned, as a spectacle to be enjoyed?and if we are not moved with shame on account of any others, are wenot on account of these citizens, whom our fathers sent as settlers toSinuessa, that this frontier might be protected from the Samnite foe:which now not the neighbouring Samnite wastes with fire, but aCarthaginian foreigner, who has advanced even thus far from theremotest limits of the world, through our dilatoriness and inactivity?What! are we so degenerate from our ancestors as tamely to see thatcoast filled with Numidian and Moorish foes, along which our fathersconsidered it a disgrace to their government that the Carthaginianfleets should cruise? We, who erewhile, indignant at the storming ofSaguntum, appealed not to men only, but to treaties and to gods,behold Hannibal scaling the walls of a Roman colony unmoved. The smokefrom the flames of our farm-houses and lands comes into our eyes andfaces; our ears ring with the cries of our weeping allies, imploringus to assist them oftener than the gods, while we here are leading ourtroops, like a herd of cattle, through shady forests and lonely paths,enveloped in clouds and woods. If Marcus Furius had resolved torecover the city from the Gauls, by thus traversing the tops ofmountains and forests, in the same manner as this modern Camillus goesabout to recover Italy from Hannibal, who has been sought out for ourdictator in our distress, on account of his unparalleled talents, Romewould be the possession of the Gauls; and I fear lest, if we are thusdilatory, our ancestors will so often have preserved it only for theCarthaginians and Hannibal; but that man and true Roman, on the veryday on which intelligence was brought him to Veii, that he wasappointed dictator, on the authority of the fathers and the nominationof the people, came down into the plain, though the Janiculum was highenough to admit of his sitting down there, and viewing the enemy at adistance, and on that very day defeated the Gallic legions in themiddle of the city, in the place where the Gallic piles are now, andon the following day on the Roman side of Gabii. What many years afterthis, when we were sent under the yoke at the Caudine forks by theSamnite foe, did Lucius Papirius Cursor take the yoke from the Romanneck and place it upon the proud Samnites, by traversing the heightsof Samnium? or was it by pressing and besieging Luceria, andchallenging the victorious enemy? A short time ago, what was it thatgave victory to Caius Lutatius but expedition? for on the day after hecaught sight of the enemy he surprised and overpowered the fleet,loaded with provisions, and encumbered of itself by its own implementsand apparatus. It is folly to suppose that the war can be brought to aconclusion by sitting still, or by prayers, the troops must be armedand led down into the plain, that you may engage man to man. The Romanpower has grown to its present height by courage and activity, and notby such dilatory measures as these, which the cowardly only designateas cautious."" A crowd of Roman tribunes and knights poured roundMinucius, while thus, as it were, haranguing, his presumptuousexpressions reached the ears of the common soldiers, and had thequestion been submitted to the votes of the soldiers, they showedevidently that they would have preferred Minucius to Fabius for theirgeneral."Book 22,Chapter 15,"Fabius, keeping his attention fixed no less upon his own troopsthan on the enemy, first shows that his resolution was unconquered bythe former. Though he well knew that his procrastination wasdisapproved, not only in his own camp, but by this time even at Rome,yet, inflexibly adhering to the same line of policy, he delayedthrough the remainder of the summer, in order that Hannibal, devoid ofall hope of a battle, which he so earnestly desired, might now lookout for a place for winter quarters, because that district was one ofpresent, but not constant, supply, consisting, as it did, ofplantations and vineyards, and all places planted luxurious ratherthan useful produce. This intelligence was to Fabius by his scouts.When he felt convinced that he would return by the same narrow passthrough which he had entered the Falernian territory, he occupiedMount Callicula and Casilinum with a pretty strong guard. Which city,intersected by the river Vulturnus, divides the Falernian andCampanian territories. He himself leads back his troops along the sameheights, having sent Lucius Hostilius Mancinus with four hundred ofthe allied cavalry to reconnoitre; who being one of the crowd ofyouths who had often heard the master of the horse fiercelyharanguing, at first advanced after the manner of a scout, in orderthat he might observe the enemy in security; and when he saw theNumidians scattered widely throughout the villages, having gotten anopportunity, he also slew a few of them. But from that moment his mindwas engrossed with the thoughts of a battle, and the injunctions ofthe dictator were forgotten, who had charged him, when he had advancedas far as he could with safety, to retreat before he came within theenemy's view. The Numidians, party after party, skirmishing andretreating, drew the general almost to their camp, to the fatigue ofhis men and horses. Then Karthalo, who had the command of the cavalry,charging at full speed, and having put them to flight before he camewithin a dart's throw, pursued them for five miles almost in acontinuous course. Mancinus, when he saw that the enemy did not desistfrom the pursuit, and that there was no hope of escape, havingencouraged his troops, turned back to the battle though inferior inevery kind of force. Accordingly he himself, and the choicest of hiscavalry, being surrounded, are cut to pieces. The rest in disorderlyretreat fled first to Cales, and thence to the dictator, by waysalmost impassable. It happened that on that day Minucius had formed ajunction with Fabius, having been sent to secure with a guard the passabove Tarracina, which, contracted into a narrow gorge, overhangs thesea, in order that Hannibal might not be able to get into the Romanterritory by the Appian way's being unguarded. The dictator and masterof the horse, uniting their forces, lead them down into the roadthrough which Hannibal was about to march his troops. The enemy wastwo miles from that place."Book 22,Chapter 16,"The following day the Carthaginians filled the whole road betweenthe two camps with his troops in marching order; and though the Romanshad taken their stand immediately under their rampart, having adecidedly superior position, yet the Carthaginian came up with hislight horse and, with a view to provoke the enemy, carried on a kindof desultory attack, first charging and then retreating. The Romanline remained in its position. The battle was slow and moreconformable to the wish of the dictator than of Hannibal. On the partof the Romans there fell two hundred, on the part of the enemy eighthundred. It now began to appear that Hannibal was hemmed in, the roadto Casilinum being blockaded; and that while Capua, and Samnium, andso many wealthy allies in the rear of the Romans might supply themwith provisions, the Carthaginian, on the other hand, must winter amidthe rocks of Formiae and the sands and hideous swamps of Liternum. Nordid it escape Hannibal that he was assailed by his own arts;wherefore, since he could not escape by way of Casilinum, and since itwas necessary to make for the mountains, and pass the summit ofCallicula, lest in any place the Romans should attack his troops whileenclosed in valleys; having hit upon a stratagem calculated to deceivethe sight, and excite terror from its appearance, by means of which hemight baffle the enemy, he resolved to come up by stealth to themountains at the commencement of night. The preparation of his wilystratagem was of this description. Torches, collected from every partof the country, and bundles of rods and dry cuttings, are fastenedbefore the horns of oxen, of which, wild and tame, he had driven awaya great number among other plunder of the country: the number of oxenwas made up to nearly two thousand. To Hasdrubal was assigned the taskof driving to the mountains that herd, after having set fire to theirhorns, as soon as ever it was dark; particularly, if he could, overthe passes beset by the enemy."Book 22,Chapter 17,"As soon as it was dark the camp was moved in silence; the oxenwere driven a little in advance of the standards. When they arrived atthe foot of the mountains and the narrow passes, the signal isimmediately given for setting fire to their horns and driving themviolently up the mountains before them. The mere terror excited by theflame, which cast a glare from their heads, and the heat nowapproaching the quick and the roots of their horns, drove on the oxenas if goaded by madness. By which dispersion, on a sudden all thesurrounding shrubs were in a blaze, as if the mountains and woods hadbeen on fire; and the unavailing tossing of their heads quickening theflame, exhibited an appearance as of men running to and fro on everyside. Those who had been placed to guard the passage of the wood, whenthey saw fires on the tops of the mountains, and some over their ownheads, concluding that they were surrounded, abandoned their post;making for the tops of the mountains in the direction in which thefewest fires blazed, as being the safest course; however they fell inwith some oxen which had strayed from their herds. At first, when theybeheld them at a distance, they stood fixed in amazement at themiracle, as it appeared to them, of creatures breathing fire;afterwards, when it showed itself to be a human stratagem, then,forsooth, concluding that there was an ambuscade, as they are hurryingaway in flight, with increased alarm, they fall in also with thelight-armed troops of the enemy. But the night, when the fear wasequally shared, kept them from commencing the battle till morning.Meanwhile Hannibal, having marched his whole army through the pass,and having cut off some of the enemy in the very defile, pitches hiscamp in the country of Allifae."Book 22,Chapter 18,"Fabius perceived this tumult, but concluding that it was a snare,and being disinclined for a battle, particularly by night, kept histroops within the works. At break of day a battle took place under thesummit of the mountain, in which the Romans, who were considerablysuperior in numbers, would have easily overpowered the light-armed ofthe enemy, cut off as they were from their party, had not a cohort ofSpaniards, sent back by Hannibal for that very purpose, reached thespot. That body being more accustomed to mountains, and being moreadapted, both from the agility of their limbs and also from thecharacter of their arms, to skirmishing amid rocks and crags, easilyfoiled, by their manner of fighting, an enemy loaded with arms,accustomed to level ground and the steady kind of fighting. Separatingfrom a contest thus by no means equal, they proceeded to their camps;the Spaniards almost all untouched; the Romans having lost a few.Fabius also moved his camp, and passing the defile, took up a positionabove Allifae, in a strong and elevated place. Then Hannibal,pretending to march to Rome through Samnium, came back as far as thePeligni, spreading devastation. Fabius led his troops along theheights midway between the army of the enemy and the city of Rome;neither avoiding him altogether, nor coming to an engagement. From thePeligni the Carthaginian turned his course, and going back again toApulia, reached Geronium, a city deserted by its inhabitants fromfear, as a part of its walls had fallen down together in ruins. Thedictator formed a completely fortified camp in the territory ofLarinum, and being recalled thence to Rome on account of some sacredrites, he not only urged the master of the horse, in virtue of hisauthority, but with advice and almost with prayers, that he wouldtrust rather to prudence than fortune; and imitate him as a generalrather than Sempronius and Flaminius; that he would not suppose thatnothing had been achieved by having worn out nearly the whole summerin baffling the enemy; that physicians too sometimes gained more byrest than by motion and action. That it was no small thing to haveceased to be conquered by an enemy so often victorious, and to havetaken breath after successive disasters. Having thus unavailinglyadmonished the master of the horse, he set out for Rome."Book 22,Chapter 19,"In the beginning of the summer in which these events occurred, thewar commenced by land and sea in Spain also. To the number of shipswhich he had received from his brother, equipped and ready for action,Hasdrubal added ten. The fleet of forty ships he delivered to Himilco:and thus setting out from Carthage, kept his ships near the land,while he led his army along the shore, ready to engage with whicheverpart of his forces the enemy might fall in with. Cneius Scipio, whenhe heard that the enemy had quitted his winter quarters, at firstformed the same plan; but afterwards, not daring to engage him byland, from a great rumour of fresh auxiliaries, he advances to meethim with a fleet of thirty-five ships, having put some chosen soldierson board. Setting out from Tarraco, on the second day, he reached aconvenient station, ten miles from the mouth of the Iberus. Two shipsof the Massilians, sent forward from that place reconnoitering,brought word back that the Carthaginian fleet was stationed in themouth of the river, and that the camp was pitched upon the bank. Inorder, therefore, to overpower them while off their guard andincautious, by a universal and wide-spread terror, he weighed anchorand advanced. In Spain there are several towers placed in highsituations, which they employ both as watch-towers and as places ofdefence against pirates. From them first, a view of the ships of theenemy having been obtained, the signal was given to Hasdrubal; and atumult arose in the camp, and on land sooner than on the ships and atsea; the dashing of the oars and other nautical noises not being yetdistinctly heard, nor the promontories disclosing the fleet. Uponthis, suddenly one horseman after another, sent out by Hasdrubal,orders those who were strolling upon the shore or resting quietly intheir tents, expecting any thing rather than the enemy and a battle onthat day, immediately to embark and take up arms: that the Roman fleetwas now a short distance from the harbour. The horsemen, despatched inevery direction, delivered these orders; and presently Hasdrubalhimself comes up with the main army. All places resound with noises ofvarious kinds; the soldiers and rowers hurrying together to the ships,rather like men running away from the land than marching to battle.Scarcely had all embarked, when some, unfastening the hawsers, arecarried out against the anchors; others cut their cables, that nothingmight impede them; and by doing every thing with hurry andprecipitation, the duties of mariners were impeded by the preparationsof the soldiers, and the soldiers were prevented from taking andpreparing for action their arms, by the bustle of the mariners. Andnow the Roman was not only approaching, but had drawn up his ships forthe battle. The Carthaginians, therefore, thrown into disorder, notmore by the enemy and the battle than by their own tumult, havingrather made an attempt at fighting than commenced a battle, turnedtheir fleet for flight; and as the mouth of the river which was beforethem could not be entered in so broad a line, and by so many pressingin at the same time, they ran their ships on shore in every part. Andbeing received, some in the shallows, and others on the dry shore,some armed and some unarmed, they escaped to their friends, who weredrawn up in battle-array over the shore. Two Carthaginian ships werecaptured and four sunk on the first encounter."Book 22,Chapter 20,"The Romans, though the enemy was master of the shore, and they sawarmed troops lining the whole bank, promptly pursuing the discomfitedfleet of the enemy, towed out into the deep all the ships which hadnot either shattered their prows by the violence with which theystruck the shore, or set their keels fast in the shallows. Theycaptured as many as twenty-five out of forty. Nor was that the mostsplendid result of their victory: but they became masters of the wholesea on that coast by one slight battle; advancing, then, with theirfleet to Honosca, and making a descent from the ships upon the coast,when they had taken the city by storm and pillaged it, they afterwardsmade for Carthage: then devastating the whole surrounding country,they, lastly, set fire also to the buildings contiguous to the walland gates. Thence the fleet laden with plunder, arrived at Longuntica,where a great quantity of oakum for naval purposes had been collectedby Hasdrubal: of this, taking away as much as was sufficient for theirnecessities, they burnt all the rest. Nor did they only sail by theprominent coasts of the continent, but crossed over into the islandEbusus; where, having with the utmost exertion, but in vain, carriedon operations against the city, which is the capital of the island,for two days, when they found that time was wasted to no purpose upona hopeless task, they turned their efforts to the devastation of thecountry; and having plundered and fired several villages, and acquireda greater booty than they had obtained on the continent, they retiredto their ships, when ambassadors from the Baliares came to Scipio tosue for peace. From this place the fleet sailed back, and returned tothe hither parts of the province, whither ambassadors of all thepeople who dwell on the Iberus, and of many people in the most distantparts of Spain, assembled. But the number of states who really becamesubject to the authority and dominion of the Romans, and gavehostages, amounted to upwards of one hundred and twenty. The Romantherefore, relying sufficiently on his land forces also, advanced asfar as the pass of Castulo. Hasdrubal retired into Lusitania, andnearer the ocean."Book 22,Chapter 21,"After this, it seemed probable that the remainder of the summerwould be peaceful; and so it would have been with regard to the Punicenemy: but besides that the tempers of the Spaniards themselves arenaturally restless, and eager for innovation, Mandonius, together withIndibilis, who had formerly been petty prince of the Ilergetes, havingstirred up their countrymen, came to lay waste the peaceful country ofthe Roman allies, after the Romans had retired from the pass to thesea-coast. A military tribune with some light-armed auxiliaries beingsent against these by Scipio, with a small effort put them all to therout, as being but a disorderly band: some having been captured andslain, a great portion of them were deprived of their arms. Thisdisturbance, however, brought back Hasdrubal, who was retiring to theocean, to protect his allies on this side the Iberus. The Carthaginiancamp was in the territory of Ilercao, the Roman camp at the New Fleet,when unexpected intelligence turned the war into another quarter. TheCeltiberians, who had sent the chief men of their country asambassadors to the Romans, and had given them hostages, aroused by amessage from Scipio, take up arms and invade the province of theCarthaginians with a powerful army; take three towns by storm; andafter that, encountering Hasdrubal himself in two battles with,splendid success, slew fifteen thousand and captured four thousand,together with many military standards."Book 22,Chapter 22,"This being the state of affairs in Spain, Publius Scipio came intohis province, having been sent thither by the senate, his commandbeing continued to him after his consulate, with thirty long ships,eight thousand soldiers, and a large importation of provisions. Thatfleet, swelled to an enormous size by a multitude of transports, beingdescried at a distance, entered safe the port of Tarraco, to the greatjoy of the citizens and allies. Landing his troops there, Scipio setout and formed a junction with his brother, and thenceforward theyprosecuted the war with united courage and counsels. While theCarthaginians, therefore, were occupied with the Celtiberian war, theypromptly crossed the Iberus, and not seeing any enemy, pursue theircourse to Saguntum; for it was reported that the hostages from everypart of Spain, having been consigned to custody, were kept in thecitadel of that place under a small guard. That pledge alone checkedthe affections of all the people of Spain, which were inclined towardsan alliance with the Romans; lest the guilt of their defection shouldbe expiated with the blood of their children. One man, by a stratagemmore subtle than honourable, liberated the Spaniards from thisrestraint. There was at Saguntum a noble Spaniard, named Abelux,hitherto faithful to the Carthaginians, but now (such are for the mostpart the dispositions of barbarians) had changed his attachment withfortune; but considering that a deserter going over to enemies withoutthe betraying of something valuable, would be looked upon only as astigmatized and worthless individual, was solicitous to render asgreat a service as possible to his new confederates. Having turnedover in his mind, then, the various means which, under the favour offortune, he might employ, in preference to every other, he appliedhimself to the delivering up of the hostages; concluding that this onething, above all others, would gain the Romans the friendship of theSpanish chieftains. But since he knew that the guards of the hostageswould do nothing without the authority of Bostar, the governor, headdresses himself with craft to Bostar himself. Bostar had his campwithout the city, just upon the shore, in order to preclude theapproach of the Romans from that quarter. He informs him, taken asideto a secret place, and as if uninformed, in what position affairswere: ""That hitherto fear had withheld the minds of the Spaniards tothem, because the Romans were at a great distance: that now the Romancamp was on this side the Iberus, a secure fortress and asylum forsuch as desired a change, that therefore those whom fear could notbind should be attached by kindness and favour."" When Bostar, inastonishment, earnestly asked him, what sudden gift of so muchimportance that could be, he replied, ""Send back the hostages to theirstates: this will be an acceptable boon, privately to their parents,who possess the greatest influence in their respective states, andpublicly to the people. Every man wishes to have confidence reposed inhim; and confidence reposed generally enforces the fidelity itself.The office of restoring the hostages to their homes, I request formyself; that I may enhance my project by the trouble bestowed, andthat I may add as much value as I can to a service in its ownintrinsic nature so acceptable."" When he had persuaded the man, whowas not cunning as compared with Carthaginian minds in general, havinggone secretly and by night to the outposts of the enemy, he met withsome auxiliary Spaniards; and having been brought by them into thepresence of Scipio, he explains what brought him. Pledges of fidelityhaving been given and received, and the time and place for deliveringthe hostages having been appointed, he returns to Saguntum. Thefollowing day he spent with Bostar, in taking his commands foreffecting the business; having so arranged it, that he should go bynight, in order that he might escape the observation of the enemy, hewas dismissed; and awakening the guards of the youths at the houragreed upon with them, set out and led them, as if unconsciously, intoa snare prepared by his own deceit. They were brought to the Romancamp, and every thing else respecting the restoration of the hostageswas transacted as had been agreed upon with Bostar, and in the samecourse as if the affair had been carried on in the name of theCarthaginians. But the favour of the Romans was somewhat greater thanthat of the Carthaginians would have been in a similar case; formisfortune and fear might have seemed to have softened them, who hadbeen found oppressive and haughty in prosperity. The Roman, on thecontrary, on his first arrival, having been unknown to them before,had begun with an act of clemency and liberality: and Abelux, a man ofprudence, did not seem likely to have changed his allies without goodcause. Accordingly all began, with great unanimity, to meditate arevolt; and hostilities would immediately have commenced, had not thewinter intervened, which compelled the Romans, and the Carthaginiansalso, to retire to shelter."Book 22,Chapter 23,"Such were the transactions in Spain also during the second summerof the Punic war; while in Italy the prudent delay of Fabius hadprocured the Romans some intermission from disasters; which conduct,as it kept Hannibal disturbed with no ordinary degree of anxiety, forit proved to him that the Romans had at length selected a general whowould carry on the war with prudence, and not in dependence onfortune; so was it treated with contempt by his countrymen, both inthe camp and in the city; particularly after that a battle had beenfought during his absence from the temerity of the master of thehorse, in its issue, as I may justly designate it, rather joyful thansuccessful. Two causes were added to augment the unpopularity of thedictator: one arising out of a stratagem and artful procedure ofHannibal; for the farm of the dictator having been pointed out to himby deserters, he ordered that the fire and sword and every outrage ofenemies should be restrained from it alone, while all around werelevelled with the ground; in order that it might appear to have beenthe term of some secret compact: the other from an act of his own, atfirst perhaps suspicious, because in it he had not waited for theauthority of the senate, but in the result turning unequivocally tohis highest credit, with relation to the exchange of prisoners: for,as was the case in the first Punic war, an agreement had been madebetween the Roman and Carthaginian generals, that whichever receivedmore prisoners than he restored, should give two pounds and a half ofsilver for every man. And when the Roman had received two hundred andforty-seven more than the Carthaginian, and the silver which was duefor them, after the matter had been frequently agitated in the senate,was not promptly supplied, because he had not consulted the fathers,he sent his son Quintus to Rome and sold his farm, uninjured by theenemy, and thus redeemed the public credit at his own private expense.Hannibal lay in a fixed camp before the walls of Geronium, which cityhe had captured and burnt, leaving only a few buildings for thepurpose of granaries: thence he was in the habit of sending outtwo-thirds of his forces to forage; with the third part kept inreadiness, he himself remained on guard, both as a protection to hiscamp, and for the purpose of looking out, if from any quarter anattack should be made upon his foragers."Book 22,Chapter 24,"The Roman army was at that time in the territory of Larinum.Minucius, the master of the horse, had the command of it; thedictator, as was before mentioned, having gone to the city. But thecamp, which had been pitched in an elevated and secure situation, wasnow brought down into the plain; plans of a bolder character,agreeably with the temper of the general, were in agitation; andeither an attack was to be made upon the scattered foragers, or uponthe camp now left with an inconsiderable guard. Nor did it escape theobservation of Hannibal, that the plan of the war had been changedwith the general, and that the enemy would act with more boldness thancounsel. Hannibal himself too, which one would scarcely credit, thoughthe enemy was near, despatched a third part of his troops to forage,retaining the remaining two-thirds in the camp. After that he advancedhis camp itself nearer to the enemy, to a hill within the enemy'sview, nearly two miles from Geronium; that they might be aware that hewas on the alert to protect his foragers if any attack should be madeupon them. Then he discovered an eminence nearer to, and commandingthe very camp of the Romans: and because if he marched openly in theday-time to occupy it, the enemy would doubtless anticipate him by ashorter way, the Numidians having been sent privately in the night,took possession of it. These, occupying this position, the Romans, thenext day, despising the smallness of their numbers, dislodge, andtransfer their camp thither themselves. There was now, therefore, buta very small space between rampart and rampart, and that the Romanline had almost entirely filled; at the same time the cavalry, withthe light infantry sent out against the foragers through the oppositepart of the camp, effected a slaughter and flight of the scatteredenemy far and wide. Nor dared Hannibal hazard a regular battle;because with so few troops, that he would scarcely be able to protecthis camp if attacked. And now he carried on the war (for part of hisarmy was away) according to the plans of Fabius, by sitting still andcreating delays. He had also withdrawn his troops to their formercamp, which was before the walls of Geronium. Some authors affirm thatthey fought in regular line, and with encountering standards; that inthe first encounter the Carthaginian was driven in disorder quite tohis camp; but that, a sally thence having been suddenly made all atonce, the Romans in their turn became alarmed; that after that thebattle was restored by the arrival of Numerius Decimius the Samnite;that this man, the first in family and fortune, not only in Bovianum,whence he came, but in all Samnium, when conducting by command of thedictator to the camp eight thousand infantry and five hundred horse,having shown himself on the rear of Hannibal, seemed to both partiesto be a fresh reinforcement coming with Quintus Fabius from Rome; thatHannibal, fearing also some ambuscade, withdrew his troops; and thatthe Roman, aided by the Samnite, pursuing him, took by storm two fortson that day; that six thousand of the enemy were slain, and about fivethousand of the Romans; but that though the loss was so nearly equal,intelligence was conveyed to Rome of a signal victory; and a letterfrom the master of the horse still more presumptuous."Book 22,Chapter 25,"These things were very frequently discussed, both in the senateand assemblies. When the dictator alone, while joy pervaded the city,attached no credit to the report or letter; and granting that all weretrue, affirmed that he feared more from success than failure; thenMarcus Metilius, a Plebeian tribune, declares that such conduct surelycould not be endured. That the dictator, not only when present was anobstacle to the right management of the affair, but also being absentfrom the camp, opposed it still when achieved; that he studiouslydallied in his conduct of the war, that he might continue the longerin office, and that he might have the sole command both at Rome and inthe army. Since one of the consuls had fallen in battle, and the otherwas removed to a distance from Italy, under pretext of pursuing aCarthaginian fleet; and the two praetors were occupied in Sicily andSardinia, neither of which provinces required a praetor at this time.That Marcus Minucius, the master of the horse, was almost put under aguard, lest he should see the enemy, and carry on any warlikeoperation. That therefore, by Hercules, not only Samnium, which hadnow been yielded to the Carthaginians, as if it had been land beyondthe Iberus, but the Campanian, Calenian, and Falernian territories hadbeen devastated, while the dictator was sitting down at Casilinum,protecting his own farm with the legions of the Roman people: that thearmy, eager for battle, as well as the master of the horse, were keptback almost imprisoned within the rampart: that their arms were takenout of their hands, as from captured enemies: at length, as soon asever the dictator had gone away, having marched out beyond theirrampart, that they had routed the enemy and put him to flight. Onaccount of which circumstances, had the Roman commons retained theirancient spirit, that he would have boldly proposed to them to annulthe authority of Quintus Fabius; but now he would bring forward amoderate proposition, to make the authority of the master of the horseand the dictator equal; and that even then Quintus Fabius should notbe sent to the army, till he had substituted a consul in the room ofCaius Flaminius. The dictator kept away from the popular assemblies,in which he did not command a favourable hearing, and even in thesenate he was not heard with favourable ears, when his eloquence wasemployed in praising the enemy, and attributing the disasters of thelast two years to the temerity and unskilfulness of the generals; andwhen he declared that the master of the horse ought to be called toaccount for having fought contrary to his injunction. That ""if thesupreme command and administration of affairs were intrusted to him,he would soon take care that men should know, that to a good generalfortune was not of great importance; that prudence and conductgoverned every thing; that it was more glorious for him to have savedthe army at a crisis, and without disgrace, than to have slain manythousands of the enemy."" Speeches of this kind having been madewithout effect, and Marcus Atilius Regulus created consul, that hemight not be present to dispute respecting the right of command, hewithdrew to the army on the night preceding the day on which theproposition was to be decided. When there was an assembly of thepeople at break of day, a secret displeasure towards the dictator, andfavour towards the master of the horse, rather possessed their minds,than that men had not sufficient resolution to advise a measure whichwas agreeable to the public; and though favour carried it, influencewas wanting to the bill. One man indeed was found who recommended thelaw, Caius Terentius Varro, who had been praetor in the former year,sprung not only from humble but mean parentage. They report that hisfather was a butcher, the retailer of his own meat, and that heemployed this very son in the servile offices of that trade."Book 22,Chapter 26,"This young man, when a fortune left him by his father, acquired insuch a traffic, had inspired him with the hope of a higher condition,and the gown and forum were the objects of his choice, by declaimingvehemently in behalf of men and causes of the lowest kind, inopposition to the interest and character of the good, first came tothe notice of the people, and then to offices of honour. Having passedthrough the offices of quaestor, plebeian, and curule aedile, and,lastly, that of praetor; when now he raised his mind to the hope ofthe consulship, he courted the gale of popular favour by maligning thedictator, and received alone the credit of the decree of the people.All men, both at Rome and in the army, both friends and foes, exceptthe dictator himself, considered this measure to have been passed asan insult to him; but the dictator himself bore the wrong which theinfuriated people had put upon him, with the same gravity with whichhe endured the charges against him which his enemies laid before themultitude; and receiving the letter containing a decree of the senaterespecting the equalization of the command while on his journey,satisfied that an equal share of military skill was not impartedtogether with the equal share of command, he returned to the army witha mind unsubdued alike by his fellow-citizens and by the enemy."Book 22,Chapter 27," But Minucius, who, in consequence of his success and the favour ofthe populace, was scarcely endurable before now especially,unrestrained by shame or moderation, boasted not more in havingconquered Hannibal than Quintus Fabius. ""That he, who had been soughtout in their distress as the only general, and as a match forHannibal; that he, an event which no record of history contains, wasby the order of the people placed upon an equal footing withhimself,--a superior with an inferior officer, a dictator with amaster of the horse,--in that very city wherein the masters of thehorse are wont to crouch and tremble at the rods and axes of thedictator. With such splendour had his valour and success shone forth.That he therefore would follow up his own good fortune, though thedictator persisted in his delay and sloth; measures condemned alike bythe sentence of gods and men."" Accordingly, on the first day on whichhe met Quintus Fabius, he intimated ""that the first point to besettled was the manner in which they should employ the command thusequalized. That he was of opinion that the best plan would be for themto be invested with the supreme authority and command either onalternate days, or, if longer intervals were more agreeable, for anydeterminate periods; in order that the person in command might be amatch for the enemy, not only in judgment, but in strength, if anyopportunity for action should occur."" Fabius by no means approved ofthis proposition: he said, ""that Fortune would have at her disposalall things which the rashness of his colleague had; that his commandhad been shared with him, and not taken away; that he would never,therefore, willingly withdraw from conducting the war, in whateverpost he could with prudence and discretion: nor would he divide thecommand with him with respect to times or days, but that he woulddivide the army, and that he would preserve, by his own measures, somuch as he could, since it was not allowed him to save the whole.""Thus he carried it, that, as was the custom of consuls, they shoulddivide the legions between them: the first and fourth fell to the lotof Minucius, the second and third to Fabius. They likewise dividedequally between them the cavalry, the auxiliaries of the allies and ofthe Latin name. The master of the horse was desirous also that theyshould have separate camps."Book 22,Chapter 28,"From this Hannibal derived a twofold joy, for nothing which wasgoing on among the enemy escaped him, the deserters revealing manythings, and he himself examining by his own scouts. For he consideredthat he should be able to entrap the unrestrained temerity of Minuciusby his usual arts, and that half the force of the sagacity of Fabiushad vanished. There was an eminence between the camps of Minucius andthe Carthaginians, whoever occupied it would evidently render theposition of his enemy less advantageous. Hannibal was not so desirousof gaining it without a contest, though that were worth his while, asto bring on a quarrel with Minucius, who, he well knew, would at alltimes throw himself in his way to oppose him. All the interveningground was at first sight unavailable to one who wished to plant anambuscade, because it not only had not any part that was woody, butnone even covered with brambles, but in reality formed by nature tocover an ambush, so much the more, because no such deception could beapprehended in a naked valley and there were in its curvatures hollowrocks, such that some of them were capable of containing two hundredarmed men. Within these recesses, five thousand infantry and cavalryare secreted, as many as could conveniently occupy each. Lest,however, in any part, either the motion of any one of themthoughtlessly coming out, or the glittering of their arms, shoulddiscover the stratagem in so open a valley, by sending out a fewtroops at break of day to occupy the before-mentioned eminence, hediverts the attention of the enemy. Immediately, on the first view ofthem, the smallness of their number was treated with contempt, andeach man began to request for himself the task of dislodging theenemy. The general himself, among the most headstrong and absurd,calls to arms to go and seize the place, and inveighs against theenemy with vain presumption and menaces. First, he despatches hislight-armed, after that his cavalry, in a close body, lastly,perceiving that succours were also being sent to the enemy, he marcheswith his legions drawn up in order of battle. Hannibal also, sendingband after band, as the contest increased, as aids to his men whendistressed, had now completed a regular army, and a battle was foughtwith the entire strength of both sides. First, the light infantry ofthe Romans, approaching the eminence, which was preoccupied, from thelower ground, being repulsed and pushed down, spread a terror amongthe cavalry, which was marching up also and fled back to the standardsof the legions: the line of infantry alone stood fearless amidst thepanic-struck; and it appeared that they would by no means have beeninferior to the enemy, had it been a regular and open battle, so muchconfidence did the successful battle a few days before inspire. Butthe troops in ambush created such confusion and alarm, by chargingthem on both flanks and on their rear, that no one had spirit enoughleft to fight, or hope enough to try to escape."Book 22,Chapter 29,"Then Fabius, first having heard the shout of the terrified troops,and then having gotten a view of their disordered line, exclaims, ""Itis so; and no sooner than I feared, has adverse fortune overtakentemerity. Equalled to Fabius in command, he sees that Hannibal issuperior to him in courage and in fortune. But another will be thetime for reproaches and resentment. Now advance your standards beyondthe rampart: let us wrest the victory from the enemy, and a confessionof their error from our countrymen."" A great part of the troops havingbeen now slain, and the rest looking about for a way to escape; thearmy of Fabius showed itself on a sudden for their help, as if sentdown from heaven. And thus, before he came within a dart's throw orjoined battle, he both stayed his friends from a precipitate flightand the enemy from excessive fierceness of fighting. Those who hadbeen scattered up and down, their ranks being broken, fled for refugefrom every quarter to the fresh army; those who had fled together inparties, turning upon the enemy, now forming a circle, retreat slowly,now concentrating themselves, stand firm. And now the vanquished andthe fresh army had nearly formed one line, and were bearing theirstandards against the enemy, when the Carthaginians sounded a retreat;Hannibal openly declaring that though he had conquered Minucius, hewas himself conquered by Fabius. The greater part of the day havingbeen thus consumed with varying success, Minucius calling together hissoldiers, when they had returned to the camp, thus addressed them: ""Ihave often heard, soldiers, that he is the greatest man who himselfcounsels what is expedient, and that he who listens to the man whogives good advice is the second, but that he who neither himself iscapable of counselling, and knows not how to obey another, is of thelowest order of mind. Since the first place of mind and talent hasbeen denied us, let us strive to obtain the second and intermediatekind, and while we are learning to command, let us prevail uponourselves to submit to a man of prudence. Let us join camps withFabius, and, carrying our standards to his pavilion, when I havesaluted him as my parent, which he deserves on account of the servicehe has rendered us and of his dignity; you, my soldiers, shall salutethose men as patrons, whose arms and right-hands just now protectedyou: and if this day has conferred nothing else upon us, it hath atleast conferred upon us the glory of possessing grateful hearts."""Book 22,Chapter 30,"The signal being given, there was a general call to collect thebaggage: then setting out, and proceeding in order of march to thedictator's camp, they excited at once the surprise of the dictatorhimself and all around him. When the standards were planted before thetribunal, the master of the horse, advancing before the rest, havingsaluted Fabius as father, and the whole body of his troops having,with one voice, saluted the soldiers who surrounded him as patrons,said, ""To my parents, dictator, to whom I have just now equalled you,only in name, as far as I could express myself, I am indebted for mylife only; to you I owe both my own preservation and that of all thesesoldiers. That order of the people, therefore, with which I have beenoppressed rather than honoured, I first cancel and annul, and (may itbe auspicious to me and you, and to these your armies, to thepreserved and the preserver,) I return to your authority and auspices,and restore to you these standards and these legions, and I entreatyou that, being reconciled, you would order that I may retain themastership of the horse, and that these soldiers may each of themretain their ranks."" After that hands were joined, and when theassembly was dismissed, the soldiers were kindly and hospitablyinvited by those known to them and unknown: and that day, from havingbeen a little while ago gloomy in the extreme, and almost accursed,was turned into a day of joy. At Rome, the report of the action wasconveyed thither, and was afterwards confirmed, not less by lettersfrom the common soldiers of both armies, than from the generalsthemselves, all men individually extolled Maximus to the skies. Hisrenown was equal with Hannibal, and his enemies the Carthaginians andthen at length they began to feel that they were engaged in war withRomans, and in Italy. For the two preceding years they entertained soutter a contempt for the Roman generals and soldiers, that they couldscarcely believe that they were waging war with the same nation whichtheir fathers had reported to them as being so formidable. They relatealso, that Hannibal said, as he returned from the field that at lengththat cloud, which was used to settle on the tops of the mountains, hadsent down a shower with a storm."Book 22,Chapter 31,"While these events occur in Italy, Cneius Servilius Geminus, theconsul, having sailed round the coast of Sardinia and Corsica with afleet of one hundred and twenty ships, and received hostages from bothplaces, crossed over into Africa, and before he made a descent uponthe continent, having laid waste the island of Meninx, and receivedfrom the inhabitants of Cercina ten talents of silver, in order thattheir fields too might not be burnt and pillaged, he approached theshores of Africa, and landed his troops. Thence the soldiers were ledout to plunder, and the crews scattered about just as if they wereplundering uninhabited islands and thus, carelessly falling upon anambuscade, when they were surrounded--the ignorant of the country bythose acquainted with it, the straggling by those in close array, theywere driven back to then ships in ignominious flight, and with greatcarnage. As many as one thousand men, together with SempioniusBlaesus, the quaestor, having been lost, the fleet hastily settingsail from the shore, which was crowded with the enemy, proceededdirect for Italy, and was given up at Lilybaeum to Titus Otacilius,the praetor, that it might be taken back to Rome by his lieutenant,Publius Suia. The consul himself, proceeding through Sicily on foot,crossed the strait into Italy, summoned, as well as his colleague,Marcus Atilius, by a letter from Quintus Fabius, to receive the armiesfrom him, as the period of his command, which was six months, hadnearly expired. Almost all the annalists record that Fabius conductedthe war against Hannibal, as dictator Caelius also writes, that he wasthe first dictator created by the people. But it has escaped Caeliusand all the others that Cneius Servilius, the consul, who was then along way from home in Gaul, which was his province, was the onlyperson who possessed the right of appointing a dictator, and that asthe state, terrified by the disasters which had just befallen it,could not abide the delay, it had recourse to the determination thatthe people should create a prodictator, that his subsequentachievements, his singular renown as a general, and his descendants,who exaggerated the inscription of his statue, easily brought it aboutthat he should be called dictator, instead of prodictator."Book 22,Chapter 32,"The consuls, Atilius and Geminus Servilius, having received, theformer the army of Fabius, the latter that of Minucius, and fortifiedtheir winter quarters in good time, (it was the close of the autumn,)carried on the war with the most perfect unanimity, according to theplans of Fabius. In many places they fell upon the troops of Hannibalwhen out on foraging excursions, availing themselves of theopportunity, and both harassing their march and intercepting thestragglers. They did not come to the chance of a general battle, whichthe enemy tried by every artifice to bring about. And Hannibal was sostraitened by the want of provisions, that had he not feared inretiring the appearance of flight, he would have returned to Gaul, nohope being left of being able to subsist an army in those quarters, ifthe ensuing consuls should carry on the war upon the same plan. Thewar having been arrested in its progress at Geronium, the winterinterrupting it, ambassadors from Naples came to Rome. They carriedinto the senate-house forty golden goblets, of great weight, and spoketo this effect. ""That they knew the treasury of the Romans wasexhausted by the war, and since the war was carried on alike indefence of the cities and the lands of the allies, and of the empireand city of Rome, the capital and citadel of Italy, that theNeapolitans thought it but fair that they should assist the Romanpeople with whatever gold had been left them by their ancestors aswell for the decoration of their temples as for the relief ofmisfortune. If they had thought that there was any resource inthemselves, that they would have offered it with the same zeal. Thatthe Roman fathers and people would render an acceptable service tothem, if they would consider all the goods of the Neapolitans as theirown, and if they would think them deserving, that they should accept apresent at their hands, rendered valuable and of consequence rather bythe spirit and affection of those who gave it with cheerfulness, thanby its intrinsic worth."" Thanks were given to the ambassadors fortheir munificence and attention, and the goblet of least weight wasaccepted."Book 22,Chapter 33,"During the same days a Carthaginian spy, who had escaped for twoyears, was apprehended at Rome, and his hands having been cut off, waslet go: and twenty-five slaves were crucified for forming a conspiracyin the Campus Martius; his liberty was given to the informer, andtwenty thousand _asses_ of the heavy standard. Ambassadors werealso sent to Philip, king of the Macedonians, to demand Demetrius ofPharia, who, having been vanquished in war had fled to him. Otherswere sent to the Ligurians, to expostulate with them for havingassisted the Carthaginians with their substance and with auxiliaries;and, at the same time, to take a near view of what was going onamongst the Boii and Insubrians. Ambassadors were also sent to theIllyrians to king Pineus, to demand the tribute, the day of payment ofwhich had passed; or if he wished to postpone the day, to receivehostages. Thus, though an arduous war was on their shoulders, noattention to any one concern in any part of the world, however remote,escapes the Romans. It was made a matter of superstitious fear also,that the temple of Concord, which Lucius Manlius, the praetor, hadvowed in Gaul two years ago, on occasion of a mutiny, had not beencontracted for to that day. Accordingly, Cneius Pupius and CaesoQuinctius Flaminius, created duumviri by Marcus Aemilius, the citypraetor, for that purpose, contract for the building a temple in thecitadel. By the same praetor a letter was sent to the consuls,agreeably to a decree of the senate, to the effect that, if theythought proper, one of them should come to Rome to elect consuls; andthat he would proclaim the election for whatever day they might name.To this it was replied by the consuls, that they could not leave theenemy without detriment to the public; that it would be better,therefore, that the election should be held by an interrex, than thatone of the consuls should be called away from the war. It appearedmore proper to the fathers, that a dictator should be nominated by aconsul, for the purpose of holding the election Lucius Veturius Philowas nominated, who chose Manius Pomponius Matho master of the horse.These having been created with some defect, they were ordered to giveup their appointment on the fourteenth day; and the state came to aninterregnum."Book 22,Chapter 34,"To the consuls the authority was continued for a year longer.Caius Claudius Centho, son of Appius, and then Publius CorneliusAsina, were appointed interreges by the fathers. During theinterregnum of the latter the election was held with a violent contestbetween the patricians and the people, Caius Terentius Varro, whom, asa man of their own order, commended to their favour by inveighingagainst the patricians and by other popular arts; who had acquiredcelebrity by maligning others, by undermining the influence of Fabius,and bringing into contempt the dictatorial authority, the commonsstrove to raise to the consulship. The patricians opposed him with alltheir might, lest men, by inveighing against them, should come to beplaced on an equality with them. Quintus Boebius Herennius, a plebeiantribune, and kinsman of Caius Terentius, by criminating not only thesenate, but the augurs also, for having prevented the dictator fromcompleting the election, by the odium cast upon them, conciliatedfavour to his own candidate. He asserted, ""that Hannibal had beenbrought into Italy by the nobility, who had for many years beendesirous of a war. That by the fraudulent machinations of the samepersons the war had been protracted, whereas it might have beenbrought to a conclusion. That it had appeared that the war could bemaintained with an army consisting of four legions in all, from MarcusMinucius's having fought with success in the absence of Fabius. Thattwo legions had been exposed to be slain by the enemy, and wereafterwards rescued from absolute destruction, in order that that manmight be saluted as father and patron, who had deprived them ofvictory before he delivered them from defeat. That subsequently theconsuls, pursuing the plans of Fabius, had protracted the war, whereasit was in their power to have put a period to it. That this was anagreement made by the nobility in general; nor would they ever havethe war concluded till they had created a consul really plebeian; thatis, a new man: for that plebeians who had attained nobility were nowinitiated into the mysteries, and had begun to look down with contemptupon plebeians, from the moment they ceased to be despised by thepatricians. Who was not fully aware that their end and object was,that an interregnum should be formed, in order that the electionsmight be under the influence of the patricians? That both the consulshad that in view in tarrying with the army: and that afterwards adictator having been nominated to hold the election contrary to theirwishes, they had carried it, as it were, by storm, that the augursshould declare the dictator informally elected. That they thereforehad gotten an interregnum; but one consulate was surely in the handsof the Roman people. Thus the people would have that at their ownunbiassed disposal, and that they would confer it on that man whowould rather conquer in reality than lengthen the term of hiscommand."""Book 22,Chapter 35,"When the people had been inflamed by these harangues, though therewere three patrician candidates for the consulship, Publius CorneliusMerenda, Lucius Manlius Vulso, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, two ofplebeian families, who had been ennobled, Caius Atilius Serranus andQuintus Aelius Paetus, one of whom was pontiff, the other an augur,Terentius alone was created consul, that the comitia for choosing hiscolleague might be in his own management. Then the nobles, findingthat the competitors whom they had set up were not strong enough,though he strenuously refused for a long time, prevail upon AemiliusPaulus, who was strongly opposed to the people, to become a candidate.He had been consul before with Marcus Livius, and from thecondemnation of his colleague, and almost of himself, had come offscathed. On the next day of the election, all who had opposed Varrowithdrawing, he is given to the consul rather as a match to oppose himthan as a colleague. Afterwards the assembly for the election ofpraetors was held, and Manius Pomponius Matho and Publius FuriusPhilus were chosen. The city lot for the administration of justice atRome fell to the lot of Pomponius; between Roman citizens andforeigners, to Philus. Two praetors were added, Marcus ClaudiusMarcellus for Sicily, and Lucius Postumius for Gaul. These were allappointed in their absence; nor was an honour which he had notpreviously borne committed to any one of them, except the consulTerentius, several brave and able men having been passed over,because, at such a juncture, it did not appear advisable that a newoffice should be committed to any one."Book 22,Chapter 36,"The forces also were augmented. But how great was the augmentationof infantry and cavalry authors vary so much, that I scarcely darepositively assert. Some state, that ten thousand soldiers were leviedas a reinforcement; others, four fresh legions, that there might beeight legions in service. It is said also, that the complement of thelegion was increased in respect both to foot and horse, one thousandfoot and one hundred horse being added to each, so that each mightcontain five thousand foot and three hundred horse; and that theallies furnished twice as many cavalry, and an equal number ofinfantry. Some authorities affirm that there were eighty-seventhousand two hundred soldiers in the Roman camp when the battle ofCannae was fought. There is no dispute, that the war was prosecutedwith greater energy and spirit than during former years, because thedictator had given them a hope that the enemy might be subdued.Before, however, the new-raised legions marched from the city, thedecemviri were ordered to have recourse to and inspect the sacredvolumes, on account of persons having been generally alarmed byextraordinary prodigies; for intelligence was brought, that it hadrained stones on the Aventine at Rome and at Aricia at the same time.That among the Sabines, statues had sweated blood copiously, and atCaere the waters had flowed warm, from a fountain. The latter prodigyexcited a greater degree of alarm, because it had frequently occurred.In a street called the Arched Way, near the Campus Martius, severalmen were struck by lightning and killed. These prodigies were expiatedaccording to the books. Ambassadors from Paestum brought some goldengoblets to Rome; they were thanked, as the Neapolitans were, but thegold was not accepted."Book 22,Chapter 37,"During the same time a fleet from Hiero arrived at Ostia with alarge cargo of supplies. The Syracusan ambassadors, on beingintroduced into the senate, delivered this message: ""That king Hierowas so much affected at the slaughter announced to him of CaiusFlaminius the consul and his troops, that he could not have been moredistressed at any disasters which could have befallen himself or hisown kingdom; and accordingly, though he was well aware that thegreatness of the Roman people was almost more admirable in adversitythan prosperity, he had nevertheless sent every thing which good andfaithful allies are wont to contribute to assist the operations ofwar, which he earnestly implored the conscript fathers not to refuseto accept. First of all, for the sake of the omen, they had brought agolden statue of Victory, of three hundred pounds' weight, which theybegged them to accept, keep by them, and hold as their own peculiarand lasting possession. That they had also brought three hundredthousand pecks of wheat, and two hundred thousand of barley, thatthere might be no want of provisions, and that as much more as mightbe necessary they would convey, as a supply, to whatever place theymight appoint. He knew that the Roman people employed no legionarytroops or cavalry who were not Romans, or of the Latin confederacy,that he had seen foreign auxiliary as well as native light-armedtroops in the Roman camps, he had, therefore, sent one thousandarchers and slingers, a suitable force against the Bahares and Moors,and other nations which fought with missile weapons"" To these presentsthey added also advice ""That the praetor to whose lot the province ofSicily had fallen, should pass a fleet over to Africa, that the enemyalso might have a war in their own country, and that less libertyshould be afforded them of sending reinforcements to Hannibal"" Thesenate thus replied to the king. ""That Hiero was a good man and anadmirable ally, and that from the time he first formed a friendshipwith the Roman people he had uniformly cultivated a spirit offidelity, and had munificently assisted the Roman cause at all timesand in every place. That this was, as it ought to be, a cause ofgratitude to the Roman people. That the Roman people had not acceptedgold which had been brought them also from certain states, though theyfelt gratitude for the act. The Victory and the omen,"" they said,""they would accept, and would assign and dedicate to that goddess, asher abode, the Capitol, the temple of Jupiter, the best and greatestof gods, hoping that, consecrated in that fortress of the city ofRome, she would continue there firm and immoveable, kind andpropitious to the Roman people."" The slingers, archers, and corn werehanded over to the consuls. To the fleet which Titus Otacilius theproprietor had in Sicily, twenty-five quinqueremes were added, andpermission was given him, if he thought it for the interest of thestate to pass over into Africa."Book 22,Chapter 38,"The levy completed, the consuls waited a few days, till the alliesof the Latin confederacy arrived. At this time the soldiers were boundby an oath, which had never before been the case, dictated by themilitary tribunes, that they would assemble at the command of theconsuls, and not depart without orders; for up to that time themilitary oath only had been employed; and further, when the soldiersmet to divide into decuries or centuries, the cavalry being formedinto decuries and the infantry into centuries, all swore together,amongst themselves, of their own accord, that they would not depart orquit their ranks for flight or fear, except for the purpose of takingup or fetching a weapon, and either striking an enemy or saving acountryman. This, from being a voluntary compact among the soldiersthemselves, was converted into the legal compulsion of an oath by thetribunes. Before the standards were moved from the city, the haranguesof Varro were frequent and furious, protesting that the war had beeninvited into Italy by the nobles, and that it would continue fixed inthe bowels of the state if it employed any more such generals asFabius; that he would bring the war to conclusion on the very day hegot sight of the enemy. His colleague Paulus made but one speech, onthe day before they set out from the city, which was more true thangratifying to the people, in which nothing was said severely againstVarro, except this only. ""That he wondered how any general, before heknew any thing of his own army, or that of the enemy, the situation ofthe places, or the nature of the country, even now while in the city,and with the gown on, could tell what he must do when in arms, andcould even foretell the day on which he would fight standard tostandard with the enemy. That, for his own part, he would not, beforethe time arrived, prematurely anticipate those measures whichcircumstances imposed on men, rather than men on circumstances. Hecould only wish that those measures which were taken with due cautionand deliberation might turn out prosperously. That temerity, settingaside its folly, had hitherto been also unsuccessful."" This obviouslyappeared, that he would prefer safe to precipitate counsels; but thathe might persevere the more constantly in this, Quintus Fabius Maximusis reported to have thus addressed him on his departure."Book 22,Chapter 39,"""If you either had a colleague like yourself, Lucius Aemilius,which is what I should prefer, or you were like your colleague, anaddress from me would be superfluous. For were you both good consuls,you would do every thing for the good of the state from your own senseof honour, even without my saying a word: and were you both badconsuls, you would neither receive my words into your ears, nor mycounsels into your minds. As the case now is, looking at yourcolleague and yourself, a man of such character, my address will besolely to you; who, I feel convinced, will prove yourself a good manand a worthy citizen in vain, if the state on the other hand shouldhalt. Pernicious counsels will have the same authority and influenceas those which are sound. For you are mistaken, Lucius Paulus, if youimagine that you will have a less violent contest with Caius Terentiusthan with Hannibal. I know not whether the former, your opponent, orthe latter, your open enemy, be the more hostile. With the latter youwill have to contend in the field only; with the former, at everyplace and time. Hannibal, moreover, you have to oppose with your ownhorse and foot; while Varro will head your own soldiers against you.Let Caius Flaminius be absent from your thoughts, even for the omen'ssake. Yet he only began to play the madman's consul, in his province,and at the head of the army. This man is raving before he put up forthe consulship, afterwards while canvassing for it, and now havingobtained it, before he has seen the camp or the enemy. And he who bytalking largely of battles and marshalled armies, even now excitessuch storms among the citizens with their gowns on, what do you thinkhe will effect among the youth in arms, where words are followedforthwith by acts? But be assured, if this man, as he protests hewill, shall immediately engage the enemy either I am unacquainted withmilitary affairs, with this kind of war, and the character of theenemy, or another place will become more celebrated than theTrasimenus by our disaster. Neither is this the season for boastingwhile I am addressing one man; and besides, I have exceeded the boundsof moderation in despising rather than in courting fame. But the caseis really this. The only way of conducting the war against Hannibal isthat which I adopted: nor does the event only, that instructor offools, demonstrate it, but that same reasoning which has continuedhitherto, and will continue unchangeable so long as circumstancesshall remain the same. We are carrying on war in Italy, in our owncountry, and our own soil. All around us are countrymen and allies inabundance. With arms, men, horses, and provisions, they do and willassist us. Such proofs of their fidelity have they given in ouradversity. Time, nay, everyday makes us better, wiser, and firmer.Hannibal, on the contrary, is in a foreign, a hostile land, amidst allhostile and disadvantageous circumstances, far from his home, far fromhis country; he has peace neither by land nor sea: no cities, no wallsreceive him: he sees nothing any where which he can call his own: hedaily lives by plunder. He has now scarcely a third part of that armywhich he conveyed across the Iberus. Famine has destroyed more thanthe sword; nor have the few remaining a sufficient supply ofprovisions. Do you doubt, therefore, whether by remaining quiet weshall not conquer him who is daily sinking into decrepitude? who hasneither provisions nor money? How long before the walls of Geronium, amiserable fortress of Apulia, as if before the walls of Carthage--?But not even in your presence will I boast. See how Cneius Serviliusand Atilius, the last consuls, fooled him. This is the only path ofsafety, Lucius Paulus, which your countrymen will render moredifficult and dangerous to you than their enemies will. For your ownsoldiers will desire the same thing as those of the enemy: Varro, aRoman consul, and Hannibal, a Carthaginian general, will wish the samething. You alone must resist two generals: and you will resist themsufficiently if you stand firm against the report and the rumours ofmen; if neither the empty glory of your colleague, and the unfoundedcalumnies against yourself, shall move you. They say that truth toooften suffers, but is never destroyed. He who despises fame will haveit genuine. Let them call you coward instead of cautious, dilatoryinstead of considerate, unwarlike instead of an expert general. Iwould rather that a sagacious enemy should fear you, than that foolishcountrymen should commend you. A man who hazards all things Hannibalwill despise, him who does nothing rashly he will fear. And neither doI advise that nothing should be done; but that in what you do, reasonshould guide you, and not fortune. All things will be within your ownpower, and your own. Be always ready armed and on the watch, andneither be wanting when a favourable opportunity presents itself, norgive any favourable opportunity to the enemy. All things are clear andsure to the deliberate man. Precipitation is improvident and blind."""Book 22,Chapter 40,"The address of the consul in reply was by no means cheerful,admitting that what he said was true, rather than easy to put inpractice. He said, ""That to him, as dictator, his master of the horsewas unbearable: what power or influence could a consul have against afactious and intemperate colleague? That he had in his formerconsulate escaped a popular conflagration not without being singed:his prayer was, that every thing might happen prosperously; but if, onthe contrary, any misfortune should occur, that he would rather exposehis life to the weapons of the enemy, than to the votes of hisincensed countrymen."" Directly after this discourse, it is relatedthat Paulus set out, escorted by the principal senators. The plebeianconsul attended his own plebeian party, more distinguished by theirnumbers than respectability. When they had arrived at the camp, theold and new troops being united, they formed two distinct camps, sothat the new and smaller one might be the nearer to Hannibal, and theold one might contain the greater part, and all the choicest of thetroops. They then sent to Rome Marcus Atilius, the consul of theformer year, who alleged his age in excuse. They appoint GeminusServilius to the command of a Roman legion, and two thousand of theallied infantry and cavalry in the lesser camp. Hannibal, although heperceived that the forces of the enemy were augmented by one-half, wasyet wonderfully rejoiced at the arrival of the consuls; for he had notonly nothing remaining of the provisions which he daily acquired byplunder, but there was not even any thing left which he could seize,the corn in all the surrounding country having been collected intofortified cities, when the country was too unsafe; so that, as wasafterwards discovered, there scarcely remained corn enough for tendays, and the Spaniards would have passed over to the enemy, throughwant of food, if the completion of that time had been awaited."Book 22,Chapter 41,"But fortune afforded materials also to the headstrong andprecipitate disposition of the consul, for in checking the plunderingparties a battle having taken place, of a tumultuary kind, andoccasioned rather by a disorderly advance of the soldiers, than by apreconcerted plan, or by the command of the general, the contest wasby no means equal with the Carthaginians. As many as one thousandseven hundred of them were slain, but not more than one hundred of theRomans and allies. The consul Paulus, however, who was in command onthat day, (for they held the command on alternate days,) apprehendingan ambuscade, restrained the victorious troops in their headstrongpursuit; while Varro indignantly vociferated, that the enemy had beenallowed to slip out of their hands, and that the war might have beenterminated had not the pursuit been stopped. Hannibal was not muchgrieved at that loss; nay, rather he felt convinced, that the temerityof the more presumptuous consul, and of the soldiers, particularly thefresh ones, would be lured by the bait; and besides, all thecircumstances of the enemy were as well known to him as his own: thatdissimilar and discordant men were in command; that nearly two-thirdsof the army consisted of raw recruits. Accordingly, concluding that henow had both a time and place adapted for an ambuscade, on thefollowing night he led his troops away with nothing but their arms,leaving the camp filled with all their effects, both public andprivate. His infantry drawn up he conceals on the left, on theopposite side of the adjoining hills; his cavalry on the right; hisbaggage in an intermediate line he leads over the mountains through avalley, in order that he might surprise the enemy when busy inplundering the camp, deserted, as they would imagine, by its owners,and when encumbered with booty. Numerous fires were left in the camp,to produce a belief that his intention was to keep the consuls intheir places by the appearance of a camp, until he could himselfescape to a greater distance, in the same manner as he had deceivedFabius the year before."Book 22,Chapter 42,"When it was day, the outpost withdrawn first occasioned surprise,then, on a nearer approach, the unusual stillness. At length, thedesertion being manifest, there is a general rush to the pavilions ofthe consuls, of those who announced the flight of the enemy soprecipitate, that they left their camp, with their tents standing;and, that their flight might be the more secret, that numerous fireswere left. Then a clamour arose that they should order the standardsto be advanced, and lead them in pursuit of the enemy, and to theimmediate plunder of the camp. The other consul too was as one of thecommon soldiers. Paulus again and again urged, that they should seetheir way before them, and use every precaution. Lastly, when he couldno longer withstand the sedition and the leader of the sedition, hesends Marius Statilius, a prefect, with a Lucanian troop, toreconnoitre, who, when he had ridden up to the gates, ordered the restto stay without the works, and entered the camp himself, attended bytwo horsemen. Having carefully examined every thing, he brings backword that it was manifestly a snare: that fires were left in that partof the camp which faced the enemy: that the tents were open, and thatall their valuables were left exposed: that in some places he had seensilver carelessly thrown about the passages, as if laid there forplunder. This intelligence, which it was hoped would deter their mindsfrom greediness, inflamed them; and the soldiers clamorouslydeclaring, that unless the signal was given they would advance withouttheir leaders, they by no means wanted one, for Varro instantly gavethe signal for marching. Paulus, whom, unwilling from his ownsuggestions to move, the chickens had not encouraged by theirauspices, ordered the unlucky omen to be reported to his colleague,when he was now leading the troops out of the gate. And though Varrobore it impatiently, yet the recent fate of Flaminius, and therecorded naval defeat of Claudius, the consul in the first Punic war,struck religious scruples into his mind. The gods themselves (it mightalmost be said) rather postponed than averted the calamity which hungover the Romans; for it fell out by mere accident, that when thesoldiers did not obey the consul who ordered them to return to thecamp, two slaves, one belonging to a horseman of Formiae, the other toone of Sidicinum, who had been cut off by the Numidians among a partyof foragers, when Servilius and Atilius were consuls, had escaped onthat day to their masters: and being brought into the presence of theconsuls, inform them that the whole army of Hannibal was lying inambush on the other side of the adjoining mountains. The seasonablearrival of these men restored the consuls to their authority, when theambition of one of them had relaxed his influence with the soldiers,by an undignified compliance.43. Hannibal, perceiving that the Romanshad been indiscreetly prompted rather than rashly carried to aconclusion, returned to his camp without effecting any thing, as hisstratagem was discovered. He could not remain there many days, inconsequence of the scarcity of corn; and, moreover, not only among thesoldiers, who were mixed up of the off-scouring of various nations,but even with the general himself, day by day new designs arose: for,first, when there had been murmuring of the soldiers, and then an openand clamorous demand of their arrears of pay, and a complaint first ofthe scarcity of provisions, and lastly of famine; and there being areport that the mercenaries, particularly the Spanish, had formed aplan of passing over to the enemy, it is affirmed that Hannibalhimself too sometimes entertained thoughts of flying into Gaul, sothat, having left all his infantry, he might hurry away with hiscavalry. Such being the plans in agitation, and such the state offeeling in the camp, he resolved to depart thence into the regions ofApulia, which were warmer, and therefore earlier in the harvest.Thinking also, that the farther he retired from the enemy, the moredifficult would desertion be to the wavering. He set out by night,having, as before, kindled fires, and leaving a few tents to producean appearance; that a fear of an ambuscade, similar to the former,might keep the Romans in their places. But when intelligence wasbrought by the same Lucanian Statilius, who had reconnoitred everyplace on the other side the mountains, and beyond the camp, that theenemy was seen marching at a distance, then plans began to bedeliberated on about pursuing him. The consuls persisted in the sameopinions they ever entertained; but nearly all acquiesced with Varro,and none with Paulus except Servilius, the consul of the former year.In compliance with the opinion of the majority, they set out, underthe impulse of destiny, to render Cannae celebrated by a Romandisaster. Hannibal had pitched his camp near that village, with hisback to the wind Vulturnus, which, in those plains which are parchedwith drought, carries with it clouds of dust. This circumstance wasnot only very advantageous to the camp, but would be a greatprotection to them when they formed their line; as they, with the windblowing only on their backs, would combat with an enemy blinded withthe thickly blown dust."Book 22,Chapter 43,"When the consuls, employing sufficient diligence in exploring theroad in pursuit of the Carthaginian, had arrived at Cannae, where theyhad the enemy in the sight of them, having divided their forces, theyfortify two camps with nearly the same interval as before, atGeronium. The river Aufidus, which flowed by both the camps, affordedapproach to the watering parties of each, as opportunity served,though not without contest. The Romans in the lesser camp, however,which was on the other side the Aufidus, were more freely furnishedwith water, because the further bank had no guard of the enemy.Hannibal, entertaining a hope that the consuls would not decline abattle in this tract, which was naturally adapted to a cavalryengagement, in which portion of his forces he was invincible, formedhis line, and provoked the enemy by a skirmishing attack with hisNumidians. Upon this the Roman camp began again to be embroiled by amutiny among the soldiers, and the disagreement of the consuls: sincePaulus instanced to Varro the temerity of Sempronius and Flaminius;while Varro pointed to Fabius, as a specious example to timid andinactive generals. The latter called both gods and men to witness,""that no part of the blame attached to him that Hannibal had now madeItaly his own, as it were, by right of possession; that he was heldbound by his colleague; that the swords and arms were taken out of thehands of the indignant soldiers who were eager to fight."" The formerdeclared, ""that if any disaster should befall the legions thus exposedand betrayed into an ill-advised and imprudent battle, he should beexempt from any blame, though the sharer of all the consequences. Thathe must take care that their hands were equally energetic in thebattle whose tongues were so forward and impetuous."""Book 22,Chapter 44,Book 22,Chapter 45,"While time is thus consumed in altercation rather thandeliberating, Hannibal, who had kept his troops drawn up in order ofbattle till late in the day, when he had led the rest of them backinto the camp, sends Numidians across the river to attack a wateringparty of the Romans from the lesser camp. Having routed thisdisorderly band by shouting and tumult, before they had well reachedthe opposite bank, they advanced even to an outpost which was beforethe rampart, and near the, very gates of the camp. It seemed so greatan indignity, that now even the camp of the Romans should be terrifiedby a tumultuary band of auxiliaries, that this cause alone kept backthe Romans from crossing the river forthwith, and forming their line,that the chief command was on that day held by Paulus. AccordinglyVarro, on the following day, on which it was his turn to hold thecommand, without consulting his colleague, displayed the signal forbattle, and forming his troops, led them across the river. Paulusfollowed, because he could better disapprove of the proceeding, thanwithhold his assistance. Having crossed the river, they add to theirforces those which they had in the lesser camp; and thus forming theirline, place the Roman cavalry in the right wing, which was next theriver; and next them the infantry: at the extremity of the left wingthe allied cavalry; within them the allied infantry, extending to thecentre, and contiguous to the Roman legions. The darters, and the restof the light-armed auxiliaries, formed the van. The consuls commandedthe wings; Terentius the left, Aemilius the right. To Geminus Seviliuswas committed the charge of maintaining the battle in the centre."Book 22,Chapter 46,"Hannibal, at break of day, having sent before him the Baliares andother light-armed troops, crossed the river, and placed his troops inline of battle, as he had conveyed them across the river. The Gallicand Spanish cavalry he placed in the left wing, opposite the Romancavalry: the right wing was assigned to the Numidian cavalry, thecentre of the line being strongly formed by the infantry, so that bothextremities of it were composed of Africans, between which Gauls andSpaniards were placed. One would suppose the Africans were for themost part Romans, they were so equipped with arms captured at theTrebia, and for the greater part at the Trasimenus. The shields of theGauls and Spaniards were of the same shape; their swords unequal anddissimilar. The Gauls had very long ones, without points. TheSpaniards, who were accustomed to stab more than to cut their enemy,had swords convenient from their shortness, and with points. Theaspect of these nations in other respects was terrific, both as to theappearance they exhibited and the size of their persons. The Gaulswere naked above the navel: the Spaniards stood arrayed in linen vestsresplendent with surprising whiteness, and bordered with purple. Thewhole amount of infantry standing in battle-array was forty thousand,of cavalry ten. The generals who commanded the wings were on the leftHasdrubal, on the right Maharbal: Hannibal himself, with his brotherMago, commanded the centre. The sun very conveniently shone obliquelyupon both parties; the Romans facing the south, and the Carthaginiansthe north; either placed so designedly, or having stood thus bychance. The wind, which the inhabitants of the district call theVulturnus, blowing violently in front of the Romans, prevented theirseeing far by rolling clouds of dust into their faces."Book 22,Chapter 47,"The shout being raised, the auxiliaries charged, and the battlecommenced in the first place with the light-armed troops: then theleft wing, consisting of the Gallic and Spanish cavalry, engages withthe Roman right wing, by no means in the manner of a cavalry battle;for they were obliged to engage front to front; for as on one side theriver, on the other the line of infantry hemmed them in, there was nospace left at their flanks for evolution, but both parties werecompelled to press directly forward. At length the horses standingstill, and being crowded together, man grappling with man, dragged himfrom his horse. The contest now came to be carried on principally onfoot. The battle, however, was more violent than lasting; and theRoman cavalry being repulsed, turn their backs. About the conclusionof the contest between the cavalry, the battle between the infantrycommenced. At first the Gauls and Spaniards preserved their ranksunbroken, not inferior in strength or courage: but at length theRomans, after long and repeated efforts, drove in with their evenfront and closely compacted line, that part of the enemy's line in theform of a wedge, which projected beyond the rest, which was too thin,and therefore deficient in strength. These men, thus driven back andhastily retreating, they closely pursued; and as they urged theircourse without interruption through this terrified band, as it fledwith precipitation, were borne first upon the centre line of theenemy; and lastly, no one opposing them, they reached the Africanreserved troops. These were posted at the two extremities of the line,where it was depressed; while the centre, where the Gauls andSpaniards were placed, projected a little. When the wedge thus formedbeing driven in, at first rendered the line level, but afterwards, bythe pressure, made a curvature in the centre, the Africans, who hadnow formed wings on each side of them, surrounded the Romans on bothsides, who incautiously rushed into the intermediate space; andpresently extending their wings, enclosed the enemy on the rear also.After this the Romans, who had in vain finished one battle, leavingthe Gauls and Spaniards, whose rear they had slaughtered, in additioncommence a fresh encounter with the Africans, not only disadvantageous,because being hemmed in they had to fight against troops who surroundedthem, but also because, fatigued, they fought with those who were freshand vigorous."Book 22,Chapter 48,"Now also in the left wing of the Romans, in which the alliedcavalry were opposed to the Numidians, the battle was joined, whichwas at first languid, commencing with a stratagem on the part of theCarthaginians. About five hundred Numidians, who, besides their usualarms, had swords concealed beneath their coats of mail, quitting theirown party, and riding up to the enemy under the semblance ofdeserters, with their bucklers behind them, suddenly leap down fromtheir horses; and, throwing down their bucklers and javelins at thefeet of their enemies, are received into their centre, and beingconducted to the rear, ordered to remain there; and there theycontinued until the battle became general. But afterwards, when thethoughts and attention of all were occupied with the contest,snatching up the shields which lay scattered on all hands among theheaps of slain, they fell upon the rear of the Roman line, andstriking their backs and wounding their hams, occasioned vast havoc,and still greater panic and confusion. While in one part terror andflight prevailed, in another the battle was obstinately persisted in,though with little hope. Hasdrubal, who was then commanding in thatquarter, withdrawing the Numidians from the centre of the army, as theconflict with their opponents was slight, sends them in pursuit of thescattered fugitives, and joining the Africans, now almost weary withslaying rather than fighting the Spanish and Gallic infantry."Book 22,Chapter 49,"On the other side of the field, Paulus, though severely woundedfrom a sling in the very commencement of the battle, with a compactbody of troops, frequently opposed himself to Hannibal, and in severalquarters restored the battle, the Roman cavalry protecting him; who,at length, when the consul had not strength enough even to manage hishorse, dismounted from their horses. And when some one broughtintelligence that the consul had ordered the cavalry to dismount, itis said that Hannibal observed, ""How much rather would I that hedelivered them to me in chains."" The fight maintained by thedismounted cavalry was such as might be expected, when the victory wasundoubtedly on the side of the enemy, the vanquished preferring deathin their places to flight; and the conquerors, who were enraged atthem for delaying the victory, butchering those whom they could notput to flight. They at length, however, drove the few who remainedaway, worn out with exertion and wounds. After that they were alldispersed, and such as could, sought to regain their horses forflight. Cneius Lentulus, a military tribune, seeing, as he rode by,the consul sitting upon a stone and covered with blood, said to him:""Lucius Aemilius! the only man whom the gods ought to regard as beingguiltless of this day's disaster, take this horse, while you have anystrength remaining, and I am with you to raise you up and protect you.Make not this battle more calamitous by the death of a consul. Thereis sufficient matter for tears and grief without this addition."" Inreply the consul said: ""Do thou indeed go on and prosper, CneiusServilius, in your career of virtue! But beware lest you waste inbootless commiseration the brief opportunity of escaping from thehands of the enemy. Go and tell the fathers publicly, to fortify thecity of Rome, and garrison it strongly before the victorious enemyarrive: and tell Quintus Fabius individually, that Lucius Aemiliuslived, and now dies, mindful of his injunctions. Allow me to expireamid these heaps of my slaughtered troops, that I may not a secondtime be accused after my consulate, or stand forth as the accuser ofmy colleague, in order to defend my own innocence by criminatinganother."" While finishing these words, first a crowd of their flyingcountrymen, after that the enemy, came upon them; they overwhelm theconsul with their weapons, not knowing who he was: in the confusionhis horse rescued Lentulus. After that they fly precipitately. Seventhousand escaped to the lesser camp, ten to the greater, about twothousand to the village itself of Cannae who were immediatelysurrounded by Carthalo and the cavalry, no fortifications protectingthe village. The other consul, whether by design or by chance, madegood his escape to Venusia with about seventy horse, without minglingwith any party of the flying troops. Forty thousand foot, two thousandseven hundred horse, there being an equal number of citizens andallies, are said to have been slain. Among both the quaestors of theconsuls, Lucius Atilius and Lucius Furius Bibaculus; twenty-onemilitary tribunes; several who had passed the offices of consul,praetor, and aedile; among these they reckon Cneius ServiliusGerminus, and Marcus Minucius, who had been master of the horse on aformer year, and consul some years before: moreover eighty, eithersenators, or who had borne those offices by which they might beelected into the senate, and who had voluntarily enrolled themselvesin the legions. Three thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry aresaid to have been captured in that battle."Book 22,Chapter 50,"Such is the battle of Cannae, equal in celebrity to the defeat atthe Allia: but as it was less important in respect to those thingswhich happened after it, because the enemy did not follow up the blow,so was it more important and more horrible with respect to theslaughter of the army; for with respect to the flight at the Allia, asit betrayed the city, so it preserved the army. At Cannae, scarcelyseventy accompanied the flying consul: almost the whole army sharedthe fate of the other who died. The troops collected in the two campsbeing a half-armed multitude without leaders, those in the larger senda message to the others, that they should come over to them at night,when the enemy was oppressed with sleep, and wearied with the battle,and then, out of joy, overpowered with feasting: that they would go inone body to Canusium. Some entirely disapproved of that advice. ""Forwhy,"" said they, ""did not those who sent for them come themselves,since there would be equal facility of forming a junction? Because,evidently, all the intermediate space was crowded with the enemy, andthey would rather expose the persons of others to so great a dangerthan their own."" Others did not so much disapprove, as want courage tofulfil the advice. Publius Sempronius Tuditanus, a military tribune,exclaims, ""Would you rather, then, be captured by the most rapaciousand cruel enemy, and have a price set upon your heads, and have yourvalue ascertained by men who will ask whether you are Roman citizensor Latin confederates, in order that from your miseries andindignities honour may be sought for another? Not you, at least, ifyou are the fellow-citizens of Lucius Aemilius, the consul whopreferred an honourable death to a life of infamy, and of so manybrave men who lie heaped around him. But, before the light overtakesus and more numerous bodies of the enemy beset the way, let us breakthrough those disorderly and irregular troops who are making a noiseat our gates. By the sword and courage, a road may be made throughenemies, however dense. In a wedge we shall make our way through thisloose and disjointed band, as if nothing opposed us. Come along withme therefore, ye who wish the safety of yourselves and the state.""Having thus said, he draws his sword, and forming a wedge, goesthrough the midst of the enemy; and as the Numidians discharged theirjavelins on their right side, which was exposed, they transferredtheir shields to the right hand, and thus escaped, to the number ofsix hundred, to the greater camp; and setting out thence forthwith,another large body having joined them, arrived safe at Canusium. Thesemeasures were taken by the vanquished, according to the impulse oftheir tempers, which his own disposition or which accident gave toeach, rather than in consequence of any deliberate plan of their own,or in obedience to the command of any one."Book 22,Chapter 51,"When all others, surrounding the victorious Hannibal,congratulated him, and advised that, having completed so great abattle, he should himself take the remainder of the day and theensuing night for rest, and grant it to his exhausted troops;Maharbal, prefect of the cavalry, who was of opinion that no timeshould be lost, said to him, ""Nay, rather, that you may know what hasbeen achieved by this battle, five days hence you shall feast intriumph in the Capitol. Follow me: I will go first with the cavalry,that they may know that I am arrived before they know of me asapproaching."" To Hannibal this project appeared too full of joy, andtoo great for his mind to embrace it and determine upon it at theinstant. Accordingly, he replied to Maharbal, that ""he applauded hiszeal, but that time was necessary to ponder the proposal."" Upon thisMaharbal observed, ""Of a truth the gods have not bestowed all thingsupon the same person. You know how to conquer, Hannibal; but you donot know how to make use of your victory."" That day's delay is firmlybelieved to have been the preservation of the city and the empire. Onthe following day, as soon as it dawned, they set about gathering thespoils and viewing the carnage, which was shocking, even to enemies.So many thousands of Romans were lying, foot and horse promiscuously,according as accident had brought them together, either in the battleor in the flight. Some, whom their wounds, pinched by the morningcold, had roused, as they were rising up, covered with blood, from themidst of the heaps of slain, were overpowered by the enemy. Some toothey found lying alive with their thighs and hams cut who, laying baretheir necks and throats, bid them drain the blood that remained inthem. Some were found with their heads plunged into the earth, whichthey had excavated; having thus, as it appeared, made pits forthemselves, and having suffocated themselves by overwhelming theirfaces with the earth which they threw over them. A living Numidian,with lacerated nose and ears, stretched beneath a lifeless Roman wholay upon him, principally attracted the attention of all; for when hishands were powerless to grasp his weapon, turning from rage tomadness, he had died in the act of tearing his antagonist with histeeth."Book 22,Chapter 52,"The spoils having been gathered for a great part of the day,Hannibal leads his troops to storm the lesser camp, and, first of all,interposing a trench, cuts it off from the river. But as the men werefatigued with toil, watching, and wounds, a surrender was made soonerthan he expected. Having agreed to deliver up their arms and horses,on condition that the ransom of every Roman should be three hundreddenarii, for an ally two hundred, for a slave one hundred, and that onpayment of that ransom they should be allowed to depart with singlegarments, they received the enemy into the camp, and were alldelivered into custody, the citizens and allies being kept separate.While the time is being spent there, all who had strength or spiritenough, to the number of four thousand foot and two hundred horse,quitted the greater camp and arrived at Canusium; some in a body,others widely dispersed through the country, which was no less securea course: the camp itself was surrendered to the enemy by the woundedand timid troops, on the same terms as the other was. A very greatbooty was obtained; and with the exception of the men and horses, andwhat silver there was which was for the most part on the trappings ofthe horses; for they had but very little in use for eating from,particularly in campaign; all the rest of the booty was given up to beplundered. Then he ordered the bodies of his own troops to becollected for burial. They are said to have been as many as eightthousand of his bravest men. Some authors relate, that the Romanconsul also was carefully searched for and buried. Those who escapedto Canusium, being received by the people of that place within theirwalls and houses only, were assisted with corn, clothes, andprovisions for their journey, by an Apulian lady, named Busa,distinguished for her family and riches; in return for whichmunificence, the senate afterwards, when the war was concluded,conferred honours upon her."Book 22,Chapter 53,"But, though there were four military tribunes there, FabiusMaximus of the first legion, whose father had been dictator the formeryear; and of the second legion, Lucius Publicius Bibulus and PubliusCornelius Scipio; and of the third legion, Appius Claudius Pulcher,who had been aedile the last year; by the consent of all, the supremecommand was vested in Publius Scipio, then a very young man, andAppius Claudius. To these, while deliberating with a few others on thecrisis of their affairs, Publius Furius Philus, the son of a man ofconsular dignity, brings intelligence, ""That it was in vain that theycherished hopes which could never be realized: that the state wasdespaired of, and lamented as lost. That certain noble youths, thechief of whom was Lucius Caecilius Metellus, turned their attention tothe sea and ships, in order that, abandoning Italy, they might escapeto some king."" When this calamity, which was not only dreadful initself, but new, and in addition to the numerous disasters they hadsustained, had struck them motionless with astonishment and stupor;and while those who were present gave it as their opinion that acouncil should be called to deliberate upon it, young Scipio, thedestined general of this war, asserts, ""That it is not a propersubject for deliberation: that courage and action, and notdeliberation, were necessary in so great a calamity. That those whowished the safety of the state would attend him forthwith in arms;that in no place was the camp of the enemy more truly, than where suchdesigns were meditated."" He immediately proceeds, attended by a few,to the lodging of Metellus; and finding there the council of youths ofwhich he had been apprized, he drew his sword over the heads of them,deliberating, and said, ""With sincerity of soul I swear that neitherwill I myself desert the cause of the Roman republic, nor will Isuffer any other citizen of Rome to desert it. If knowingly I violatemy oath, then, O Jupiter, supremely great and good, mayest thou visitmy house, my family, and my fortune with perdition the most horrible!I require you, Lucius Caecilius, and the rest of you who are present,to take this oath; and let the man who shall not take it be assured,that this sword is drawn against him."" Terrified, as though they werebeholding the victorious Hannibal, they all take the oath, and deliverthemselves to Scipio to be kept in custody."Book 22,Chapter 54,"During the time in which these things were going on at Canusium,as many as four thousand foot and horse, who had been dispersedthrough the country in the flight, came to Venusia, to the consul.These the Venusini distributed throughout their families, to be kindlyentertained and taken care of; and also gave to each horseman a gown,a tunic, and twenty-five denarii; and to each foot soldier tendenarii, and such arms as they wanted; and every other kind ofhospitality showed them, both publicly and privately: emulouslystriving that the people of Venusia might not be surpassed by a womanof Canusium in kind offices. But the great number of her guestsrendered the burden more oppressive to Busa, for they amounted now toten thousand men. Appius and Scipio, having heard that the otherconsul was safe, immediately send a messenger to inquire how great aforce of infantry and cavalry he had with him, and at the same time toask, whether it was his pleasure that the army should be brought toVenusia, or remain at Canusium. Varro himself led over his forces toCanusium. And now there was some appearance of a consular army, andthey seemed able to defend themselves from the enemy by walls, if notby arms. At Rome intelligence had been received, that not even theserelics of their citizens and allies had survived, but that the twoconsuls, with their armies, were cut to pieces, and all their forcesannihilated. Never when the city was in safety was there so great apanic and confusion within the walls of Rome. I shall therefore shrinkfrom the task, and not attempt to relate what in describing I mustmake less than the reality. The consul and his army having been lostat the Trasimenus the year before, it was not one wound upon anotherwhich was announced, but a multiplied disaster, the loss of twoconsular armies, together with the two consuls: and that now there wasneither any Roman camp, nor general nor soldiery: that Apulia andSamnium, and now almost the whole of Italy, were in the possession ofHannibal. No other nation surely would not have been overwhelmed bysuch an accumulation of misfortune. Shall I compare with it thedisaster of the Carthaginians, sustained in a naval battle at theislands Aegates, dispirited by which they gave up Sicily and Sardinia,and thenceforth submitted to become tributary and stipendiary? Orshall I compare with it the defeat in Africa under which this sameHannibal afterwards sunk? In no respect are they comparable, exceptthat they were endured with less fortitude."Book 22,Chapter 55,"Publius Furius Philus and Manius Pomponius, the praetors,assembled the senate in the curia hostilia, that they might deliberateabout the guarding of the city; for they doubted not but that theenemy, now their armies were annihilated, would come to assault Rome,the only operation of the war which remained. Unable to form any planin misfortunes, not only very great, but unknown and undefined, andwhile the loud lamentations of the women were resounding, and nothingwas as yet made known, the living and the dead alike being lamented inalmost every house; such being the state of things, Quintus Fabiusgave it as his opinion, ""That light horsemen should be sent out on theLatin and Appian ways, who, questioning those they met, as some wouldcertainly be dispersed in all directions from the flight, might bringback word what was the fate of the consuls and their armies; and ifthe gods, pitying the empire, had left any remnant of the Roman namewhere these forces were; whither Hannibal had repaired after thebattle, what he was meditating; what he was doing, or about to do.That these points should be searched out and ascertained by activeyouths. That it should be the business of the fathers, since there wasa deficiency of magistrates, to do away with the tumult andtrepidation in the city; to keep the women from coming into public,and compel each to abide within her own threshold; to put a stop tothe lamentations of families; to obtain silence in the city; to takecare that the bearers of every kind of intelligence should be broughtbefore the praetors; that each person should await at home the bearerof tidings respecting his own fortune: moreover, that they should postguards at the gates, to prevent any person from quitting the city; andoblige men to place their sole hopes of safety in the preservation ofthe walls and the city. That when the tumult had subsided the fathersshould be called again to the senate-house, and deliberate on thedefence of the city."""Book 22,Chapter 56,"When all had signified their approbation of this opinion, andafter the crowd had been removed by the magistrates from the forum,and the senators had proceeded in different directions to allay thetumult; then at length a letter is brought from the consul Terentius,stating, ""That Lucius Aemilius, the consul, and his army were slain;that he himself was at Canusium, collecting, as it were after ashipwreck, the remains of this great disaster; that he had nearly tenthousand irregular and unorganized troops. That the Carthaginian wassitting still at Cannae, bargaining about the price of the captivesand the other booty, neither with the spirit of a conqueror nor in thestyle of a great general."" Then also the losses of private familieswere made known throughout the several houses; and so completely wasthe whole city filled with grief, that the anniversary sacred rite ofCeres was intermitted, because it was neither allowable to perform itwhile in mourning, nor was there at that juncture a single matron whowas not in mourning. Accordingly, lest the same cause should occasionthe neglect of other public and private sacred rites, the mourning waslimited to thirty days, by a decree of the senate. Now when the tumultin the city was allayed, an additional letter was brought from Sicily,from Titus Otacilius, the propraetor, stating, ""that the kingdom ofHiero was being devastated by the Carthaginian fleet: and that, beingdesirous of affording him the assistance he implored, he receivedintelligence that another Carthaginian fleet was stationed at theAegates, equipped and prepared; in order that when the Carthaginianshad perceived that he was gone away to protect the coast of Syracuse,they might immediately attack Lilybaeum and other parts of the Romanprovince; that he therefore needed a fleet, if they wished him toprotect the king their ally, and Sicily."""Book 22,Chapter 57,"The letters of the consul and the propraetor having been read,they resolved that Marcus Claudius, who commanded the fleet stationedat Ostia, should be sent to the army to Canusium; and a letter bewritten to the consul, to the effect that, having delivered the armyto the praetor, he should return to Rome the first moment he could,consistently with the interest of the republic. They were terrifiedalso, in addition to these disasters, both with other prodigies, andalso because two vestal virgins, Opimia and Floronia, were that yearconvicted of incontinence; one of whom was, according to custom,buried alive at the Colline gate; the other destroyed herself. LuciusCantilius, secretary of the pontiff, whom they now call the lesserpontiffs, who had debauched Floronia, was beaten by rods in thecomitium, by order of the chief pontiff, so that he expired under thestripes. This impiety being converted into a prodigy, as is usuallythe case when happening in the midst of so many calamities, thedecemviri were desired to consult the sacred books. Quintus FabiusPictor was also sent to Delphi, to inquire of the oracle by whatprayers and offerings they might appease the gods, and whattermination there would be to such great distresses. Meanwhile certainextraordinary sacrifices were performed, according to the directionsof the books of the fates; among which a Gallic man and woman, and aGreek man and woman, were let down alive in the cattle market, into aplace fenced round with stone, which had been already polluted withhuman victims, a rite by no means Roman. The gods being, as theysupposed, sufficiently appeased, Marcus Claudius Marcellus sends fromOstia to Rome, as a garrison for the city, one thousand five hundredsoldiers, which he had with him, levied for the fleet. He himselfsending before him a marine legion, (it was the third legion,) underthe command of the military tribunes, to Teanum Sidicinum, anddelivering the fleet to Publius Furius Philus, his colleague, after afew days, proceeded by long marches to Cannsium. Marcus Junius,created dictator on the authority of the senate, and Titus Sempronius,master of the horse, proclaiming a levy, enrol the younger men fromthe age of seventeen, and some who wore the toga praetexta: of these,four legions and a thousand horse were formed. They send also to theallies and the Latin confederacy, to receive the soldiers according tothe terms of the treaty. They order that arms, weapons, and otherthings should be prepared; and they take down from the temples andporticoes the old spoils taken from the enemy. They adopted alsoanother and a new form of levy, from the scarcity of free persons, andfrom necessity: they armed eight thousand stout youths from theslaves, purchased at the public expense, first inquiring of eachwhether he was willing to serve. They preferred this description oftroops, though they had the power of redeeming the captives at a lessexpense."Book 22,Chapter 58,"For Hannibal, after so great a victory at Cannae, being occupiedwith the cares of a conqueror, rather than one who had a war toprosecute, the captives having been brought forward and separated,addressed the allies in terms of kindness, as he had done before atthe Trebia and the lake Trasimenus, and dismissed them without aransom; then he addressed the Romans too, who were called to him, invery gentle terms: ""That he was not carrying on a war of exterminationwith the Romans, but was contending for honour and empire. That hisancestors had yielded to the Roman valour; and that he wasendeavouring that others might be obliged to yield, in their turn, tohis good fortune and valour together. Accordingly, he allowed thecaptives the liberty of ransoming themselves, and that the price perhead should be five hundred denarii for a horseman, three hundred fora foot soldier, and one hundred for a slave."" Although some additionwas made to that sum for the cavalry, which they stipulated forthemselves when they surrendered, yet they joyfully accepted any termsof entering into the compact. They determined that ten persons shouldbe selected, by their own votes, who might go to Rome to the senate;nor was any other guarantee of their fidelity taken than that theyshould swear that they would return. With these was sent Carthalo, anoble Carthaginian, who might propose terms, if perchance their mindswere inclined towards peace. When they had gone out of the camp, oneof their body, a man who had very little of the Roman character, underpretence of having forgotten something, returned to the camp, for thepurpose of freeing himself from the obligation of his oath, andovertook his companions before night. When it was announced that theyhad arrived at Rome, a lictor was despatched to meet Carthalo, to tellhim, in the words of the dictator, to depart from the Romanterritories before night."Book 22,Chapter 59,"An audience of the senate was granted by the dictator to thedelegates of the prisoners. The chief of them, Marcus Junius, thusspoke: ""There is not one of us, conscript fathers, who is not awarethat there never was a nation which held prisoners in greater contemptthan our own. But unless our own cause is dearer to us than it shouldbe, never did men fall into the hands of the enemy who less deservedto be disregarded than we do; for we did not surrender our arms in thebattle through fear; but having prolonged the battle almost tillnight-fall, while standing upon heaps of our slaughtered countrymen,we betook ourselves to our camp. For the remainder of the day andduring the following night, although exhausted with exertion andwounds, we protected our rampart. On the following day, when, beset bythe enemy, we were deprived of water, and there was no hope ofbreaking through the dense bands of the enemy; and, moreover, notconsidering it an impiety that any Roman soldier should survive thebattle of Cannae, after fifty thousand of our army had been butchered;then at length we agreed upon terms on which we might be ransomed andlet off; and our arms, in which there was no longer any protection, wedelivered to the enemy. We had been informed that our ancestors alsohad redeemed themselves from the Gauls with gold, and that though sorigid as to the terms of peace, had sent ambassadors to Tarentum forthe purpose of ransoming the captives. And yet both the fight at theAllia with the Gauls, and at Heraclea with Pyrrhus, was disgraceful,not so much on account of the loss as the panic and flight. Heaps ofRoman carcasses cover the plains of Cannae; nor would any of us havesurvived the battle, had not the enemy wanted the strength and thesword to slay us. There are, too, some of us, who did not even retreatin the field; but being left to guard the camp, came into the hands ofthe enemy when it was surrendered. For my part, I envy not the goodfortune or condition of any citizen or fellow-soldier, nor would Iendeavour to raise myself by depressing another: but not even thosemen who, for the most part, leaving their arms, fled from the field,and stopped not till they arrived at Venusia or Canusium; not eventhose men, unless some reward is due to them on account of theirswiftness of foot and running, would justly set themselves before us,or boast that there is more protection to the state in them than inus. But you will both find them to be good and brave soldiers, and usstill more zealous, because, by your kindness, we have been ransomedand restored to our country. You are levying from every age andcondition: I hear that eight thousand slaves are being armed. We areno fewer in number; nor will the expense of redeeming us be greaterthan that of purchasing these. Should I compare ourselves with them, Ishould injure the name of Roman. I should think also, conscriptfathers, that in deliberating on such a measure, it ought also to beconsidered, (if you are disposed to be over severe, which you cannotdo from any demerit of ours,) to what sort of enemy you would abandonus. Is it to Pyrrhus, for instance, who treated us, when hisprisoners, like guests; or to a barbarian and Carthaginian, of whom itis difficult to determine whether his rapacity or cruelty be thegreater? If you were to see the chains, the squalid appearance, theloathsomeness of your countrymen, that spectacle would not, I amconfident, less affect you, than if, on the other hand, you beheldyour legions prostrate on the plains of Cannae. You may behold thesolicitude and the tears of our kinsmen, as they stand in the lobby ofyour senate-house, and await your answer. When they are in so muchsuspense and anxiety in behalf of us, and those who are absent, whatthink you must be our own feelings, whose lives and liberty are atstake? By Hercules! should Hannibal himself, contrary to his nature,be disposed to be lenient towards us, yet we should not consider ourlives worth possessing, since we have seemed unworthy of beingransomed by you. Formerly, prisoners dismissed by Pyrrhus, withoutransom, returned to Rome; but they returned in company withambassadors, the chief men of the state, who were sent to ransom them.Would I return to my country, a citizen, and not considered worththree hundred denarii? Every man has his own way of thinking,conscript fathers. I know that my life and person are at stake. Butthe danger which threatens my reputation affects me most, if we shouldgo away rejected and condemned by you; for men will never suppose thatyou grudged the price of our redemption."""Book 22,Chapter 60,"When he had finished his address, the crowd of persons in thecomitium immediately set up a loud lamentation, and stretched outtheir hands to the senate, imploring them to restore to them theirchildren, their brothers, and their kinsmen. Their fears and affectionfor their kindred had brought the women also with the crowd of men inthe forum. Witnesses being excluded, the matter began to be discussedin the senate. There being a difference of opinion, and some advisingthat they should be ransomed at the public charge, others, that thestate should be put to no expense, but that they should not beprevented redeeming themselves at their own cost; and that those whohad not the money at present should receive a loan from the publiccoffer, and security given to the people by their sureties andproperties; Titus Manlius Torquatus, a man of primitive, and, as someconsidered, over-rigorous severity, being asked his opinion, isreported thus to have spoken: ""Had the deputies confined themselves tomaking a request, in behalf of those who are in the hands of theenemy, that they might be ransomed, I should have briefly given myopinion, without inveighing against any one. For what else would havebeen necessary but to admonish you, that you ought to adhere to thecustom handed down from your ancestors, a precedent indispensable tomilitary discipline. But now, since they have almost boasted of havingsurrendered themselves to the enemy, and have claimed to be preferred,not only to those who were captured by the enemy in the field, but tothose also who came to Venusia and Canusium, and even to the consulTerentius himself; I will not suffer you to remain in ignorance ofthings which were done there. And I could wish that what I am about tobring before you, were stated at Canusium, before the army itself, thebest witness of every man's cowardice or valour; or at least that oneperson, Publius Sempronius, were here, whom had they followed as theirleader, they would this day have been soldiers in the Roman camp, andnot prisoners in the power of the enemy. But though the enemy wasfatigued with fighting, and engaged in rejoicing for their victory,and had, the greater part of them, retired into their camp, and theyhad the night at their disposal for making a sally, and as they wereseven thousand armed troops, might have forced their way through thetroops of the enemy, however closely arrayed; yet they neither ofthemselves attempted to do this, nor were willing to follow another.Throughout nearly the whole night Sempronius ceased not to admonishand exhort them, while but few of the enemy were about the camp, whilethere was stillness and quiet, while the night would conceal theirdesign, that they would follow him; that before daybreak they mightreach places of security, the cities of their allies. If as PubliusDecius, the military tribune in Samnium, said, within the memory ofour grandfathers; if he had said, as Calpurnius Flamma, in the firstPunic war, when we were youths, said to the three hundred volunteers,when he was leading them to seize upon an eminence situated in themidst of the enemy: LET US DIE, SOLDIERS, AND BY OUR DEATHS RESCUE THESURROUNDED LEGIONS FROM AMBUSCADE;--if Publius Sempronius had saidthus, he would neither have considered you as Romans nor men, had noone stood forward as his companion in so valorous an attempt. Hepoints out to you the road that leads not to glory more than tosafety; he restores you to your country, your parents, your wives andchildren. Do you want courage to effect your preservation? What wouldyou do if you had to die for your country? Fifty thousand of yourcountrymen and allies on that very day lay around you slain. If somany examples of courage did not move you, nothing ever will. If sogreat a carnage did not make life less dear, none ever will. While infreedom and safety, show your affection for your country; nay, ratherdo so while it is your country, and you its citizens. Too late you nowendeavour to evince your regard for her when degraded, disfranchisedfrom the rights of citizens, and become the slaves of theCarthaginians. Shall you return by purchase to that degree which youhave forfeited by cowardice and neglect? You did not listen toSempronius, your countryman, when he bid you take arms and follow him;but a little after you listened to Hannibal, when he ordered your armsto be surrendered, and your camp betrayed. But why do I charge thosemen with cowardice, when I might tax them with villany? They not onlyrefused to follow him who gave them good advice, but endeavoured tooppose and hold him back, had not some men of the greatest bravery,drawing their swords, removed the cowards. Publius Sempronius, I say,was obliged to force his way through a band of his countrymen, beforehe burst through the enemy's troops. Can our country regret suchcitizens as these, whom if all the rest resembled, she would not haveone citizen of all those who fought at Cannae? Out of seven thousandarmed men, there were six hundred who had courage to force their way,who returned to their country free, and in arms; nor did fortythousand of the enemy successfully oppose them. How safe, think you,would a passage have been for nearly two legions? Then you would havehad this day at Canusium, conscript fathers, twenty thousand bold andfaithful. But now how can these men be called faithful and goodcitizens, (for they do not even call themselves brave,) except any mansuppose that they showed themselves such when they opposed those whowere desirous of forcing their way through the enemy? or, unless anyman can suppose, that they do not envy those men their safety andglory acquired by valour, when the must know that their timidity andcowardice were the cause of their ignominious servitude? Skulking intheir tents they preferred to wait for the light and the enemytogether, when they had an opportunity of sallying forth during thesilence of the night. But though they had not courage to sally forthfrom the camp, had they courage to defend it strenuously? Havingendured a siege for several days and nights, did they protect theirrampart by their arms, and themselves by their rampart? At length,having dared and suffered every extremity, every support of life beinggone, their strength exhausted with famine, and unable to hold theirarms, were they subdued by the necessities of nature rather than byarms? At sunrise, the enemy approached the rampart: before the secondhour, without hazarding any contest, they delivered up their arms andthemselves. Here is their military service for you during two days.When they ought to have stood firm in array and fight on, then theyfled back into their camp; when they ought to have fought before theirrampart, they delivered up their camp: good for nothing, either in thefield or the camp. I redeem you. When you ought to sally from thecamp, you linger and hesitate; and when you ought to stay and protectyour camp in arms, you surrender the camp, your arms, and yourselvesto the enemy. I am of opinion, conscript fathers, that these menshould no more be ransomed, than that those should be surrendered toHannibal, who sallied from the camp through the midst of the enemy,and, with the most distinguished courage, restored themselves to theircountry."""Book 22,Chapter 61,"After Manlius had thus spoken, notwithstanding the captives wererelated to many even of the senators, besides the practice of thestate, which had never shown favour to captives, even from theremotest times, the sum of money also influenced them: for they wereneither willing to drain the treasury, a large sum of money havingbeen already issued for buying and arming slaves to serve in the war,nor to enrich Hannibal, who, according to report, was particularly inwant of this very thing. The sad reply, that the captives would not beransomed, being delivered, and fresh grief being added to the formeron account of the loss of so many citizens, the people accompanied thedeputies to the gate with copious tears and lamentations. One of themwent home, because he had evaded his oath by artfully returning to thecamp. But when this was known and laid before the senate, they allresolved that he should be apprehended and conveyed to Hannibal byguards, furnished by the state. There is another account respectingthe prisoners, that ten came first, and that, the senate hesitatingwhether they should be admitted into the city or not, they wereadmitted, on the understanding that they should not have an audienceof the senate. That when these staid longer than the expectation ofall, three more came, Scribonius, Calpurnius, and Manlius. That thenat length a tribune of the people, a relation of Scribonius, laidbefore the senate the redemption of the captives, and that theyresolved that they should not be ransomed. That the three lastdeputies returned to Hannibal, and the ten former remained, becausethey had evaded their oath, having returned to Hannibal after havingset out, under pretence of learning afresh the names of the captives.That a violent contest took place in the senate, on the question ofsurrendering them, and that those who thought they ought to besurrendered were beaten by a few votes, but that they were so brandedby every kind of stigma and ignominy by the ensuing censors, that someof them immediately put themselves to death, and the rest, for alltheir life afterwards, not only shunned the forum, but almost thelight and publicity. You can more easily wonder that authors differ somuch than determine what is the truth. How much greater this disasterwas than any preceding, even this is a proof, that such of the alliesas had stood firm till that day then began to waver, for no othercause certainly but that they despaired of the empire. The people whorevolted to the Carthaginians were these: the Atellani, Calatini, theHirpini, some of the Apulians, the Samnites, except the Pentrians, allthe Bruttians, and the Lucanians. Besides these the Surrentinians, andalmost the whole coast possessed by the Greeks, the people ofTarentum, Metapontum, Croton, the Locrians, and all Cisalpine Gaul.Yet not even these losses and defections of their allies so shook thefirmness of the Romans, that any mention of peace was made among them,either before the arrival of the consul at Rome, or after he camethither, and renewed the memory of the calamity they had suffered. Atwhich very juncture, such was the magnanimity of the state, that theconsul, as he returned after so severe a defeat, of which he himselfwas the principal cause, was met in crowds of all ranks of citizens,and thanks bestowed because he had not despaired of the republic, inwhose case, had he been a Carthaginian commander, no species ofpunishment would have been spared."Book 23,Chapter 1,"After the battle of Cannae, Hannibal, having captured and plunderedthe Roman camp, had immediately removed from Apulia into Samnium;invited into the territory of the Hirpini by Statius, who promisedthat he would surrender Compsa. Tiebius, a native of Compsa, wasconspicuous for rank among his countrymen; but a faction of the Mopsiikept him down--a family of great influence through the favour of theRomans. After intelligence of the battle of Cannae, and a report ofthe approach of Hannibal, circulated by the discourse of Trebius, theMopsian party had retired from the city; which was thus given up tothe Carthaginian without opposition, and a garrison received into it.Leaving there all his booty and baggage, and dividing his forces, heorders Mago to receive under his protection the cities of thatdistrict which might revolt from the Romans, and to force to defectionthose which might be disinclined. He himself, passing through theterritory of Campania, made for the lower sea, with the intention ofassaulting Naples, in order that he might be master of a maritimecity. As soon as he entered the confines of the Neapolitan territory,he placed part of his Numidians in ambush, wherever he could find aconvenient spot; for there are very many hollow roads and secretwindings: others he ordered to drive before them the booty they hadcollected from the country, and, exhibiting it to the enemy, to rideup to the gates of the city. As they appeared to be few in number andin disorder, a troop of horse sallied out against them, which was cutoff, being drawn into an ambuscade by the others, who purposelyretreated: nor would one of them have escaped, had not the sea beennear, and some vessels, principally such as are used in fishing,observed at a short distance from the shore, afforded an escape forthose who could swim. Several noble youths, however, were captured andslain in that affair. Among whom, Hegeas, the commander of thecavalry, fell when pursuing the retreating enemy too eagerly. Thesight of the walls, which were not favourable to a besieging force,deterred the Carthaginian from storming the city."Book 23,Chapter 2,"Thence he turned his course to Capua, which was wantoning under along course of prosperity, and the indulgence of fortune: amid thegeneral corruption, however, the most conspicuous feature was theextravagance of the commons, who exercised their liberty withoutlimit. Pacuvius Calavius had rendered the senate subservient tohimself and the commons, at once a noble and popular man, but who hadacquired his influence by dishonourable intrigues. Happening to holdthe chief magistracy during the year in which the defeat at theTrasimenus occurred, and thinking that the commons, who had long feltthe most violent hostility to the senate, would attempt some desperatemeasure, should an opportunity for effecting a change present itself;and if Hannibal should come into that quarter with his victoriousarmy, would murder the senators and deliver Capua to theCarthaginians; as he desired to rule in a state preserved rather thansubverted (for though depraved he was not utterly abandoned), and ashe felt convinced that no state could be preserved if bereaved of itspublic council, he adopted a plan by which he might preserve thesenate and render it subject to himself and the commons. Havingassembled the senate, he prefaced his remarks by observing, ""thatnothing would induce him to acquiesce in a plan of defection from theRomans, were it not absolutely necessary; since he had children by thedaughter of Appius Claudius, and had a daughter at Rome married toLivius: but that a much more serious and alarming matter threatenedthem, than any consequences which could result from such a measure.For that the intention of the commons was not to abolish the senate byrevolting to the Carthaginians, but to murder the senators, anddeliver the state thus destitute to Hannibal and the Carthaginians.That it was in his power to rescue them from this danger, if theywould resign themselves to his care, and, forgetting their politicaldissensions, confide in him."" When, overpowered with fear, they allput themselves under his protection, he proceeded: ""I will shut you upin the senate-house, and pretending myself to be an accomplice in themeditated crime, I will, by approving measures which I should in vainoppose, find out a way for your safety. For the performance of thistake whatever pledge you please."" Having given his honour, he wentout; and having ordered the house to be closed, placed a guard in thelobby that no one might enter or leave it without his leave."Book 23,Chapter 3,"Then assembling the people, he thus addressed them: ""What you haveso often wished for, Campanians, the power of punishing anunprincipled and detestable senate, you now have, not at your ownimminent peril, by riotously storming the houses of each, which areguarded and garrisoned with slaves and dependants, but free andwithout danger. Take them all, shut up in the senate-house, alone andunarmed; nor need you do any thing precipitately or blindly. I willgive you the opportunity of pronouncing upon the life or death ofeach, that each may suffer the punishment he has deserved. But, aboveall, it behoves you so to give way to your resentment, as consideringthat your own safety and advantage are of greater importance. For Iapprehend that you hate these particular senators, and not that youare unwilling to have any senate at all; for you must either have aking, which all abominate, or a senate, which is the only coursecompatible with a free state. Accordingly you must effect two objectsat the same time; you must remove the old senate and elect a new one.I will order the senators to be summoned one by one, and I shall putit to you to decide whether they deserve to live or die: whatever youmay determine respecting each shall be done; but before you executeyour sentence on the culprit, you shall elect some brave and strenuousman as a fresh senator to supply his place."" Upon this he took hisseat, and, the names having been thrown together into an urn, heordered that the name which had the lot to fall out first should beproclaimed, and the person brought forward out of the senate-house.When the name was heard, each man strenuously exclaimed that he was awicked and unprincipled fellow, and deserved to be punished. Pacuviusthen said, ""I perceive the sentence which has been passed on this man;now choose a good and upright senator in the room of this wicked andunprincipled one."" At first all was silence, from the want of a betterman whom they might substitute; afterwards, one of them, laying asidehis modesty, nominating some one, in an instant a much greater clamourarose; while some denied all knowledge of him, others objected to himat one time on account of flagitious conduct, at another time onaccount of his humble birth, his sordid circumstances, and thedisgraceful nature of his trade and occupation. The same occurred withincreased vehemence with respect to the second and third senators, sothat it was evident that they were dissatisfied with the senatorhimself, but had not any one to substitute for him; for it was of nouse that the same persons should be nominated again, to no otherpurpose than to hear of their vices, and the rest were much more meanand obscure than those who first occurred to their recollection. Thusthe assembly separated, affirming that every evil which was most knownwas easiest to be endured, and ordering the senate to be dischargedfrom custody."Book 23,Chapter 4,"Pacuvius, having thus rendered the senators more subservient tohimself than to the commons by the gift of their lives, ruled withoutthe aid of arms, all persons now acquiescing. Henceforward thesenators, forgetful of their rank and independence, flattered thecommons; saluted them courteously; invited them graciously;entertained them with sumptuous feasts; undertook those causes, alwaysespoused that party, decided as judges in favour of that side, whichwas most popular, and best adapted to conciliate the favour of thecommons. Now, indeed, every thing was transacted in the senate as ifit had been an assembly of the people. The Capuans, ever prone toluxurious indulgence not only from natural turpitude, but from theprofusion of the means of voluptuous enjoyment which flowed in uponthem, and the temptations of all the luxuries of land and sea; at thattime especially proceeded to such a pitch of extravagance inconsequence of the obsequiousness of the nobles and the unrestrainedliberty of the commons, that their lust and prodigality had no bounds.To a disregard for the laws, the magistrates, and the senate, now,after the disaster of Cannae, was added a contempt for the Romangovernment also, for which there had been some degree of respect. Theonly obstacles to immediate revolt were the intermarriages which, froma remote period, had connected many of their distinguished andinfluential families with the Romans; and, which formed the strongestbond of union, that while several of their countrymen were serving inthe Roman armies, particularly three hundred horsemen, the flower ofthe Campanian nobility, had been selected and sent by the Romans togarrison the cities of Sicily."Book 23,Chapter 5,"The parents and relations of these men with difficulty obtainedthat ambassadors should be sent to the Roman consul. The consul, whohad not yet set out for Canusium, they found at Venusia with a fewhalf-armed troops, an object of entire commiseration to faithful, butof contempt to proud and perfidious allies, like the Campanians. Theconsul too increased their contempt of himself and his cause, by toomuch exposing and exhibiting the disastrous state of his affairs; forwhen the ambassadors had delivered their message, which was, that thesenate and people of Capua were distressed that any adverse eventshould have befallen the Romans, and were promising every assistancein prosecuting the war, he observed, ""In bidding us order you tofurnish us with all things which are necessary for the war,Campanians, you have rather observed the customary mode of addressingallies, than spoken suitably to the present posture of our affairs;for hath anything been left us at Cannae, so that, as if we possessedthat, we can desire what is wanting to be supplied by our allies? Canwe order a supply of infantry, as if we had any cavalry? Can we say weare deficient in money, as if that were the only thing we wanted?Fortune has not even left us anything which we can add to. Ourlegions, cavalry, arms, standards, horses, men, money, provisions, allperished either in the battle, or in the two camps which were lost thefollowing day. You must, therefore, Campanians, not assist us in thewar, but almost take it upon yourselves in our stead. Call to mind howformerly at Saticula we received into our protection and defended yourancestors, when dismayed and driven within their walls; terrified notonly by their Samnite but Sidicinian enemies; and how we carried on,with varying success, through a period of almost a century, a war withthe Samnites, commenced on your account. Add to this, that when yougave yourselves up to us we granted you an alliance on equal terms,that we allowed you your own laws, and lastly, what before thedisaster at Cannae was surely a privilege of the highest value, webestowed the freedom of our city on a large portion of you, and heldit in common with you. It is your duty, therefore, Campanians, to lookupon this disaster which has been suffered as your own, and toconsider that our common country must be protected. It is not aSamnite or Tuscan foe we are engaged with, so that the empire takenfrom us might still continue in Italy. A Carthaginian enemy drawsafter him from the remotest regions of the world, from the straits ofthe ocean and the pillars of Hercules, a body of soldiers who are noteven natives of Africa, destitute of all laws, and of the conditionand almost of the language of men. Savage and ferocious from natureand habit, their general has rendered them still more so, by formingbridges and works with heaps of human bodies; and, what the tongue canscarcely utter, by teaching them to live on human flesh. What man,provided he were born in any part of Italy, would not abominate theidea of seeing and having for his masters these men, nourished withsuch horrid food, whom even to touch were an impiety; of fetching lawsfrom Africa and Carthage; and of suffering Italy to become a provinceof the Moors and Numidians? It will be highly honourable, Campanians,that the Roman empire, sinking under this disastrous defeat, should besustained and restored by your fidelity and your strength. I conceivethat thirty thousand foot and four thousand horse may be raised inCampania. You have already abundance of money and corn. If your zealcorresponds with your means, neither will Hannibal feel that he hasbeen victorious, nor the Romans that they have been defeated."""Book 23,Chapter 6,"After the consul had thus spoken, the ambassadors were dismissed;and as they were returning home, one of them, named Vibius Virius,observed, ""that the time had arrived at which the Campanians might notonly recover the territory once injuriously taken away by the Romans,but also possess themselves of the sovereignty of Italy. For theymight form a treaty with Hannibal on whatever terms they pleased; andthere could be no question but that after Hannibal, having put an endto the war, had himself retired victorious into Africa, and hadwithdrawn his troops, the sovereignty of Italy would be left to theCampanians."" All assenting to Vibius, as he said this, they framedtheir report of the embassy so that all might conclude that the Romanpower was annihilated. Immediately the commons and the major part ofthe senate turned their attention to revolt. The measure, however, waspostponed for a few days at the instigation of the elder citizens. Atlast, the opinion of the majority prevailed, that the same ambassadorswho had gone to the Roman consul should be sent to Hannibal. I find incertain annals, that before this embassy proceeded, and before theyhad determined on the measure of revolting, ambassadors were sent bythe Campanians to Rome, requiring that one of the consuls should beelected from Campania if they wished assistance to the Roman cause.That from the indignation which arose, they were ordered to be removedfrom the senate-house, and a lictor despatched to conduct them out ofthe city and command them to lodge that day without the Romanfrontier. But as this request is too much like that which the Latinsformerly made, and as Coelius and other writers had, not withoutreason, made no mention of it, I have not ventured to vouch for itstruth."Book 23,Chapter 7,"The ambassadors came to Hannibal and concluded a treaty of peacewith him on the terms, ""That no Carthaginian commander should have anyauthority over a Campanian citizen, nor any Campanian serve in war orperform any office against his will: that Capua should have her ownlaws and her own magistrates: that the Carthaginian should give to theCampanians three hundred captives selected by themselves, who might beexchanged for the Campanian horse who were serving in Sicily."" Suchwere the stipulations: but in addition to them, the Campaniansperpetrated the following atrocities; for the commons ordered that theprefects of the allies and other citizens of Rome should be suddenlyseized, while some of them were occupied with military duties, othersengaged in private business, and be shut up in the baths, as if forthe purpose of keeping them in custody, where, suffocated with heatand vapour, they might expire in a horrid manner. Decius Magius, a manwho wanted nothing to complete his influence except a sound mind onthe part of his countrymen, had resisted to the uttermost theexecution of these measures, and the sending of the embassy toHannibal, and when he heard that a body of troops was sent byHannibal, bringing back to their recollection, as examples, thehaughty tyranny of Pyrrhus and the miserable slavery of theTarentines, he at first openly and loudly protested that the troopsshould not be admitted, then he urged either that they should expelthem when received, or, if they had a mind to expiate, by a bold andmemorable act, the foul crime they had committed in revolting fromtheir most ancient and intimate allies, that leaving slain theCarthaginian troops they should give themselves back to the Romans.These proceedings, having been reported to Hannibal, for they were notcarried on in secret, he at first sent persons to summon Magius intohis presence at his camp, then, on his vehemently refusing to come, onthe ground that Hannibal had no authority over a Campanian, theCarthaginian, excited with rage, ordered that the man should be seizedand dragged to him in chains, but afterwards, fearing lest while forcewas employed some disturbance might take place, or lest, fromexcitement of feeling, some undesigned collision might occur, he setout himself from the camp with a small body of troops, having sent amessage before him to Marius Blosius, the praetor of Campania, to theeffect, that he would be at Capua the next day. Marius calling anassembly, issued an order that they should go out and meet Hannibal ina body, accompanied by their wives and children. This was done by all,not only with obedience, but with zeal, with the full agreement of thecommon people, and with eagerness to see a general renderedillustrious by so many victories. Decius Magius neither went out tomeet him, nor kept himself in private, by which course he might seemto indicate fear from a consciousness of demerit, he promenaded in theforum with perfect composure, attended by his son and a fewdependants, while all the citizens were in a bustle to go to see andreceive the Carthaginian. Hannibal, on entering the city, immediatelydemanded an audience of the senate; when the chief men of theCampanians, beseeching him not to transact any serious business onthat day, but that he would cheerfully and willingly celebrate a daydevoted to festivity in consequence of his own arrival, thoughnaturally extremely prone to anger, yet, that he might not deny themany thing at first, he spent a great part of the day in inspecting thecity."Book 23,Chapter 8,"He lodged at the house of the Ninii Celeres, Stenius and Pacuvius,men distinguished by their noble descent and their wealth. ThitherPacuvius Calavius, of whom mention has already been made, who was thehead of the party which had drawn over the state to the Carthaginiancause, brought his son, a young man, whom he had forced from the sideof Decius Magius, in conjunction with whom he had made a mostdetermined stand for the Roman alliance in opposition to the leaguewith the Carthaginians; nor had the leaning of the state to the otherside, or his father's authority, altered his sentiments. For thisyouth his father procured pardon from Hannibal, more by prayers thanby clearing him. Hannibal, overcome by the entreaties and tears of hisfather, even gave orders that he should be invited with his father tothe banquet; to which entertainment he intended to admit no Campanianbesides his hosts, and Jubellius Taurea, a man distinguished in war.They began to feast early in the day, and the entertainment was notconformable to the Carthaginian custom, or to military discipline, butas might be expected in a city and in a house both remarkable forluxury, was furnished with all the allurements of voluptuousness.Perolla, the son of Calavius, was the only person who could not be woneither by the solicitations of the masters of the house, or thosewhich Hannibal sometimes employed. The youth himself pleaded illhealth as an apology, while his father urged as an excuse thedisturbed state of his mind, which was not surprising. About sunset,Calavius, who had gone out from the banquet, was followed by his son;and when they had arrived at a retired place, (it was a garden at theback part of the house,) he said, ""I have a plan to propose to you, myfather, by which we shall not only obtain pardon from the Romans forour crime, in that we revolted from them to the Carthaginian, butshall be held in much higher esteem, than we Campanians ever havebeen."" When the father inquired with surprise what that plan could be,he threw back his gown off his shoulder and exposed to view his side,which was girt with a sword. ""Forthwith will I ratify the alliancewith Rome with the blood of Hannibal. I was desirous that you shouldbe informed of it first, in case you might prefer to be absent whilethe deed is performing."""Book 23,Chapter 9,"On hearing and seeing which the old man, as though he were actuallypresent at the transactions which were being named to him, wild withfear, exclaimed, ""I implore, I beseech you, my son, by all the tieswhich unite children to parents, that you will not resolve to commitand to suffer every thing that is horrible before the eyes of afather. Did we but a few hours ago, swearing by every deity, andjoining right hands, pledge our fidelity to Hannibal, that immediatelyon separating from the conference we should arm against him the handswhich were employed as the sacred pledges of our faith? Do you risefrom the hospitable board to which as one of three of the Campaniansyou have been admitted by Hannibal, that you may ensanguine that veryboard with the blood of your host. Could I conciliate Hannibal to myson, and not my son to Hannibal? But let nothing be held sacred byyou, neither our pledges, nor the sense of religion, nor filial duty;let the most horrid deeds be dared, if with guilt they bring not ruinupon us. Will you singly attack Hannibal? What will that numerousthrong of freemen and slaves be doing? What the eyes of all intent onhim alone? What those so many right hands? Will they be torpid amidstyour madness? Will you be able to bear the look of Hannibal himself,which armed hosts cannot sustain, from which the Roman people shrinkwith horror? And though other assistance be wanting, will you have thehardihood to strike me when I oppose my body in defence of Hannibal's?But know that through my breast you must strike and transfix him.Suffer yourself to be deterred from your attempt here, rather than tobe defeated there. May my entreaties prevail with you, as they did foryou this day."" Upon this, perceiving the youth in tears, he threw hisarms around him, and kissing him affectionately, ceased not hisentreaties until he prevailed upon him to lay aside his sword and givehis promise that he would do no such thing. The young man thenobserved, ""I will indeed pay to my father the debt of duty which I oweto my country, but I am grieved for you on whom the guilt of havingthrice betrayed your country rests; once when you sanctioned therevolt from the Romans; next when you advised the alliance withHannibal; and thirdly, this day, when you are the delay and impedimentof the restoration of Capua to the Romans. Do thou, my country,receive this weapon, armed with which in thy behalf I would fain havedefended this citadel, since a father wrests it from me."" Having thussaid, he threw the sword into the highway over the garden wall, andthat the affair might not be suspected, himself returned to thebanquet."Book 23,Chapter 10,"The next day an audience of a full senate was given to Hannibal,when the first part of his address was full of graciousness andbenignity, in which he thanked the Campanians for having preferred hisfriendship to an alliance with the Romans, and held out among hisother magnificent promises ""that Capua should soon become the capitalof all Italy, and that the Romans as well as the other states shouldreceive laws from it. That there was, however, one person who had noshare in the Carthaginian friendship and the alliance formed with him,Decius Magius, who neither was nor ought to be called a Campanian. Himhe requested to be surrendered to him, and that the sense of thesenate should be taken respecting his conduct, and a decree passed inhis presence."" All concurred in this proposition, though a great manyconsidered him as a man undeserving such severe treatment; and thatthis proceeding was no small infringement of their liberty to beginwith. Leaving the senate-house, the magistrate took his seat on theconsecrated bench, ordered Decius Magius to be apprehended, and to beplaced by himself before his feet to plead his cause. But he, hisproud spirit being unsubdued, denied that such a measure could beenforced agreeably to the conditions of the treaty; upon which he wasironed, and ordered to be brought into the camp before a lictor. Aslong as he was conducted with his head uncovered, he moved alongearnestly haranguing and vociferating to the multitude which pouredaround him on all sides. ""You have gotten that liberty, Campanians,which you seek; in the middle of the forum, in the light of day,before your eyes, I, a man second to none of the Campanians, amdragged in chains to suffer death. What greater outrage could havebeen committed had Capua been captured? Go out to meet Hannibal,decorate your city to the utmost, consecrate the day of his arrival,that you may behold this triumph over a fellow-citizen."" As thepopulace seemed to be excited by him, vociferating these things, hishead was covered, and he was ordered to be dragged away more speedilywithout the gate. Having been thus brought to the camp, he wasimmediately put on board a ship and sent to Carthage, lest if anycommotion should arise at Capua on account of the injustice of theproceeding, the senate also should repent of having given up a leadingcitizen; and lest if an embassy were sent to request his restoration,he must either offend his new allies by refusing their first petition,or, by granting it, be compelled to retain at Capua a promoter ofsedition and disturbance. A tempest drove the vessel to Cyrenae, whichwas at that time under the dominion of kings. Here flying for refugeto the statue of king Ptolemy, he was conveyed thence in custody toAlexandria to Ptolemy; and having instructed him that he had beenthrown into chains by Hannibal, contrary to the law of treaties, hewas liberated and allowed to return to whichever place he pleased,Rome or Capua. But Magius said, that Capua would not be a safe placefor him, and that Rome, at a time when there was war between theRomans and Capuans, would be rather the residence of a deserter than aguest. That there was no place that he should rather dwell in, than inthe dominions of him whom he esteemed an avenger and the protector ofhis liberty."Book 23,Chapter 11,"While these things were carrying on, Quintus Fabius Pictor, theambassador, returned from Delphi to Rome, and read the response of theoracle from a written copy. In it both the gods were mentioned, and inwhat manner supplication should be made. It then stated, ""If you dothus, Romans, your affairs will be more prosperous and less perplexed;your state will proceed more agreeably to your wishes; and the victoryin the war will be on the side of the Roman people. After that yourstate shall have been restored to prosperity and safety, send apresent to the Pythian Apollo out of the gains you have earned, andpay honours to him out of the plunder, the booty, and the spoils.Banish licentiousness from among you."" Having read aloud these words,translated from the Greek verse, he added, that immediately on hisdeparture from the oracle, he had paid divine honours to all thesedeities with wine and frankincense; and that he was ordered by thechief priest of the temple, that, as he had approached the oracle andperformed the sacred ceremonies decorated with a laurel crown, so heshould embark wearing the crown, and not put it off till he hadarrived at Rome. That he had executed all these injunctions with themost scrupulous exactness and diligence, and had deposited the garlandon the altar of Apollo at Rome. The senate decreed that the sacredceremonies and supplications enjoined should be carefully performedwith all possible expedition. During these events at Rome and inItaly, Mago, the son of Hamilcar, had arrived at Carthage with theintelligence of the victory at Cannae. He was not sent direct from thefield of battle by his brother, but was detained some days inreceiving the submission of such states of the Bruttii as were inrevolt. Having obtained an audience of the senate he gave a fullstatement of his brother's exploits in Italy: ""That he had foughtpitched battles with six generals, four of whom were consuls, two adictator and master of the horse, with six consular armies; that hehad slain above two hundred thousand of the enemy, and captured abovefifty thousand. That out of the four consuls he had slain two; of thetwo remaining, one was wounded, the other, having lost his whole army,had fled from the field with scarcely fifty men; that the master ofthe horse, an authority equal to that of consul, had been routed andput to flight; that the dictator, because he had never engaged in apitched battle, was esteemed a matchless general; that the Bruttii,the Apulians, part of the Samnites and of the Lucanians had revoltedto the Carthaginians. That Capua, which was the capital not only ofCampania, but after the ruin of the Roman power by the battle ofCannae, of Italy also, had delivered itself over to Hannibal. That inreturn for these so many and so great victories, gratitude oughtassuredly to be felt and thanks returned to the immortal gods."""Book 23,Chapter 12,"Then, in proof of this such joyful news, he ordered the goldenrings to be poured out in the vestibule of the senate-house, of whichthere was such a heap that some have taken upon themselves to say thaton being measured they filled three pecks and a half. The statementhas obtained and is more like the truth, that there were not more thana peck. He then added, by way of explanation, to prove the greaterextent of the slaughter, that none but knights, and of these theprincipal only, wore that ornament. The main drift of his speech was,""that the nearer the prospect was of bringing the war to a conclusion,the more should Hannibal be aided by every means, for that the seat ofwar was at a long distance from home and in the heart of the enemy'scountry. That a great quantity of corn was consumed and moneyexpended; and that so many pitched battles, as they had annihilatedthe armies of the enemy, had also in some degree diminished the forcesof the victor. That a reinforcement therefore ought to be sent; andmoney for the pay, and corn for the soldiers who had deserved so wellof the Carthaginian name."" After this speech of Mago's, all beingelated with joy, Himilco, a member of the Barcine faction, conceivingthis a good opportunity for inveighing against Hanno, said to him,""What think you now, Hanno? do you now also regret that the waragainst the Romans was entered upon? Now urge that Hannibal should begiven up; yes, forbid the rendering of thanks to the immortal godsamidst such successes; let us hear a Roman senator in the senate-houseof the Carthaginians."" Upon which Hanno replied, ""I should haveremained silent this day, conscript fathers, lest, amid the generaljoy, I should utter any thing which might be too gloomy for you. Butnow, to a senator, asking whether I still regret the undertaking ofthe war against the Romans, if I should forbear to speak, I shouldseem either arrogant or servile, the former of which is the part of aman who is forgetful of the independence of others, the latter of hisown. I may answer therefore to Himilco, that I have not ceased toregret the war, nor shall I cease to censure your invincible generaluntil I see the war concluded on some tolerable terms; nor will anything except a new peace put a period to my regret for the loss of theold one. Accordingly those achievements, which Mago has so boastinglyrecounted, are a source of present joy to Himilco and the otheradherents of Hannibal; to me they may become so; because successes inwar, if we have a mind to make the best use of fortune, will afford usa peace on more equitable terms; for if we allow this opportunity topass by, on which we have it in our power to appear to dictate ratherthan to receive terms of peace, I fear lest even this our joy shouldrun into excess, and in the end prove groundless. However, let us seeof what kind it is even now. I have slain the armies of the enemy,send me soldiers. What else would you ask if you had been conquered? Ihave captured two of the enemy's camps, full, of course, of booty andprovisions; supply me with corn and money. What else would you ask hadyou been plundered and stripped of your camp? And that I may not bethe only person perplexed, I could wish that either Himilco or Magowould answer me, for it is just and fair that I also should put aquestion, since I have answered Himilco. Since the battle at Cannaeannihilated the Roman power, and it is a fact that all Italy is in astate of revolt; in the first place, has any one people of the Latinconfederacy come over to us? In the next place, has any individual ofthe five and thirty tribes deserted to Hannibal?"" When Mago hadanswered both these questions in the negative, he continued: ""thereremains then still too large a body of the enemy. But I should be gladto know what degree of spirit and hope that body possesses."""Book 23,Chapter 13,"Mago declaring that he did not know; ""Nothing,"" said he, ""iseasier to be known. Have the Romans sent any ambassadors to Hannibalto treat of peace? Have you, in short, ever heard that any mention hasbeen made of peace at Rome?"" On his answering these questions also inthe negative: ""We have upon our hands then, said he, a war as entireas we had on the day on which Hannibal crossed over into Italy. Thereare a great many of us alive now who remember how fluctuating thesuccess was in the former Punic war. At no time did our affairs appearin so prosperous a condition as they did before the consulship ofCaius Lutatius and Aulus Posthumius. In the consulship of CaiusLutatius and Aulus Posthumius we were completely conquered at theislands Aegates. But if now, as well as then, (oh! may the gods avertthe omen!) fortune should take any turn, do you hope to obtain thatpeace when we shall be vanquished which no one is willing to grant nowwe are victorious. I have an opinion which I should express if any oneshould advise with me on the subject of proffering or accepting termsof peace with the enemy; but with respect to the supplies requested byMago, I do not think there is any necessity to send them to avictorious army; and I give it as my opinion that they should far lessbe sent to them, if they are deluding us by groundless and emptyhopes."" But few were influenced by the harangue of Hanno, for both thejealousy which he entertained towards the Barcine family, made him aless weighty authority; and men's minds being taken up with thepresent exultation, would listen to nothing by which their joy couldbe made more groundless, but felt convinced, that if they should makea little additional exertion the war might be speedily terminated.Accordingly a decree of the senate was made with very generalapprobation, that four thousand Numidians should be sent as areinforcement to Hannibal, with four hundred elephants and manytalents of silver. Moreover, the dictator was sent forward into Spainwith Mago to hire twenty thousand foot and four thousand horse, torecruit the armies in Italy and Spain."Book 23,Chapter 14,"But these resolutions, as generally happens in the season ofprosperity, were executed in a leisurely and slothful manner. TheRomans, in addition to their inborn activity of mind, were preventedfrom delaying by the posture of their affairs. For the consul was notwanting in any business which was to be done by him; and the dictator,Marcus Junius Pera, after the sacred ceremonies were concluded, andafter having, as is usual, proposed to the people that he might beallowed to mount his horse; besides the two legions which had beenenlisted by the consuls in the beginning of the year, and besides thecohorts collected out of the Picenian and Gallic territories,descended to that last resort of the state when almost despaired of,and when propriety gives place to utility, and made proclamation, thatof such persons as had been guilty of capital crimes or were in prisonon judgment for debt, those who would serve as soldiers with him, hewould order to be released from their liability to punishment andtheir debts. These six thousand he armed with the Gallic spoils whichwere carried in the procession at the triumph of Caius Flaminius. Thushe marched from the city at the head of twenty-five thousand men.Hannibal, after gaining Capua, made a second fruitless attempt uponthe minds of the Neapolitans, partly by fear and partly by hope: andthen marched his troops across into the territory of Nola: notimmediately in a hostile attitude, for he did not despair of avoluntary surrender, yet intending to omit nothing which they couldsuffer or fear, if they delayed the completion of his hopes. Thesenate, and especially the principal members of it, perseveredfaithfully in keeping up the alliance with the Romans; the commons, asusual, were all inclined to a change in the government and to espousethe cause of Hannibal, placing before their minds the fear lest theirfields should be devastated, and the many hardships and indignitieswhich must be endured in a siege; nor were there wanting persons whoadvised a revolt. In this state of things, when a fear took possessionof the senate, that it would be impossible to resist the excitedmultitude if they went openly to work, devised a delay of the evil bysecret simulation. They pretended that they were agreeable to therevolt to Hannibal; but that it was not settled on what terms theyshould enter into the new alliance and friendship. Thus having gainedtime, they promptly sent ambassadors to the Roman praetor, MarcellusClaudius, who was at Casilinum with his army, and informed him what acritical situation Nola was in; that the fields were already in thepossession of Hannibal and the Carthaginians, and that the city soonwould be, unless succour were sent; that the senate, by conceding tothe commons that they would revolt when they pleased, had caused themnot to hasten too much to revolt. Marcellus, after bestowing highcommendations on the Nolans, urged them to protract the business tillhis arrival by means of the same pretences; in the mean time, toconceal what had passed between them, as well as all hope of succourfrom the Romans. He himself marched from Casilinum to Calatia, andthence crossing the Vulturnus, and passing through the territories ofSaticula and Trebula, pursuing his course along the mountains aboveSuessula, he arrived at Nola."Book 23,Chapter 15,"On the approach of the Roman praetor, the Carthaginians retiredfrom the territory of Nola and marched down to the sea close uponNaples, eager to get possession of a maritime town to which therewould be a safe course for ships from Africa. But hearing that Napleswas held by a Roman prefect, Marcus Junius Silanus, who had beeninvited thither by the Neapolitans themselves, he left Naples as hehad left Nola, and directed his course to Nuceria, which he at lengthstarved into capitulation, after having besieged it for a considerabletime, often by open force, and often by soliciting to no purposesometimes the commons, at other times the nobles; agreeing that theyshould depart with single garments and without arms. Then, as wishingto appear from the beginning to show lenity to all the inhabitants ofItaly except the Romans, he proposed rewards and honours to those whomight remain with him, and would be willing to serve with him. Heretained none, however, by the hopes he held out; they all dispersedin different directions throughout the cities of Campania, wherevereither hospitable connexions or the casual impulse of the minddirected them, but principally to Nola and Naples. About thirtysenators, including as it happened all of the first rank, made forCapua; but being shut out thence, because they had closed their gateson Hannibal, they betook themselves to Cumae. The plunder of Nuceriawas, given to the soldiery, the city sacked and burned. Marcelluscontinued to hold possession of Nola, relying not more from confidencein his own troops than from the favourable disposition of the leadinginhabitants. Apprehensions were entertained of the commons,particularly Lucius Bantius, whose having been privy to an attempt atdefection, and dread of the Roman praetor, stimulated sometimes to thebetrayal of his country, at others, should fortune fail him in thatundertaking, to desertion. He was a young man of vigorous mind, and atthat time enjoying the greatest renown of almost any of the alliedcavalry. Found at Cannae half dead amid a heap of slain, Hannibal hadsent him home, after having had him cured, with the kindest attention,and even with presents. In gratitude for this favour, he had conceiveda wish to put Nola under the power and dominion of the Carthaginian;but his anxiety and solicitude for effecting a change did not escapethe notice of the praetor. However, as it was necessary that he shouldbe either restrained by penal inflictions or conciliated by favours,he preferred attaching to himself a brave and strenuous ally, todepriving the enemy of him; and summoning him into his presence, inthe kindest manner said, ""that the fact that he had many among hiscountrymen who were jealous of him, might be easily collected from thecircumstance that not one citizen of Nola had informed him how manywere his splendid military exploits. But that it was impossible forthe valour of one who served in the Roman camp to remain in obscurity;that many who had served with him had reported to him how brave a manhe was, how often and what dangers he had encountered for the safetyand honour of the Roman people; and how in the battle of Cannae he hadnot given over fighting till, almost bloodless, he was buried under aheap of men, horses, and arms which fell upon him. Go on then,"" sayshe, ""and prosper in your career of valour, with me you shall receiveevery honour and every reward, and the oftener you be with me, themore you shall find it will be to your honour and emolument."" Hepresented the young man, delighted with these promises, with a horseof distinguished beauty, ordered the quaestor to give him five hundreddenarii, and commanded the lictors to allow him to approach himwhenever he might please."Book 23,Chapter 16,"The violent spirit of the youth was so much soothed by thecourteous treatment of Marcellus, that thenceforward no one of theallies displayed greater courage or fidelity in aiding the Romancause. Hannibal being now at the gates, for he had moved his camp backagain from Nuceria to Nola, and the commons beginning to turn theirattention to revolt afresh, Marcellus, on the approach of the enemy,retired within the walls; not from apprehension for his camp, but lesthe should give an opportunity for betraying the city, which too manywere anxiously watching for. The troops on both sides then began to bedrawn up; the Romans before the walls of Nola, the Carthaginiansbefore their own camp. Hence arose several battles of small accountbetween the city and the camp, with varying success, as the generalswere neither willing to check the small parties who inconsideratelychallenged the enemy, nor to give the signal for a general engagement.While the two armies continued to be thus stationed day after day, thechief men of the Nolans informed Marcellus, that conferences were heldby night between the commons of Nola and the Carthaginians; and thatit was fixed, that, when the Roman army had gone out at the gates,they should make plunder of their baggage and packages, then close thegates and post themselves upon the walls, in order that when inpossession of the government and the city, they might then receive theCarthaginian instead of the Roman. On receiving this intelligenceMarcellus, having bestowed the highest commendations on the senators,resolved to hazard the issue of a battle before any commotion shouldarise within the city. He drew up his troops in three divisions at thethree gates which faced the enemy; he gave orders that the baggageshould follow close by, that the servants, suttlers' boys, andinvalids should carry palisades; at the centre gate he stationed thechoicest of the legionary troops and the Roman cavalry, at the twogates on either side, the recruits, the light-armed, and the alliedcavalry. The Nolans were forbidden to approach the walls and gates,and the troops designed for a reserve were set over the baggage, lestwhile the legions were engaged in the battle an attack should be madeupon it. Thus arranged they were standing within the gates. Hannibal,who had waited with his troops drawn up in battle-array, as he haddone for several days, till the day was far advanced, at first wasamazed that neither the Roman army marched out of the gates, nor anyarmed man was to be seen on the walls, but afterwards concluding thatthe conferences had been discovered, and that they were quiet throughfear, he sent back a portion of his troops into the camp, with ordersto bring into the front line, with speed, every thing requisite forassaulting the city; satisfied that if he urged them vigorously whilethey were indisposed to action, the populace would excite somecommotion in the city. While, in the van, the troops were running upand down in a hurried manner in discharge of their several duties, andthe line was advancing up to the gates, suddenly throwing open thegate, Marcellus ordered that the signal should be given, and a shoutraised, and that first the infantry and after them the cavalry shouldburst forth upon the enemy with all possible impetuosity. They hadoccasioned abundant terror and confusion in the centre of the enemy'sline, when, at the two side gates, the lieutenant-generals, PubliusValerius Flaccus and Caius Aurelius, sallied forth upon the wings. Theservants, suttlers' boys, and the other multitude appointed to guardthe baggage, joined in the shout, so that they suddenly exhibited theappearance of a vast army to the Carthaginians, who despised chieflytheir paucity of numbers. For my own part I would not take upon me toassert what some authors have declared, that two thousand eighthundred of the enemy were slain, and that the Romans lost not morethan five hundred. Whether the victory was so great or not; it iscertain that a very important advantage, and perhaps the greatestduring the war, was gained on that day: for not to be vanquished byHannibal was then a more difficult task to the victorious troops, thanto conquer him afterwards."Book 23,Chapter 17,"When Hannibal, all hope of getting possession of Nola being lost,had retired to Acerrae, Marcellus, having closed the gates and postedguards in different quarters to prevent any one from going out,immediately instituted a judicial inquiry in the forum, into theconduct of those who had been secretly in communication with theenemy. He beheaded more than seventy who were convicted of treason,and ordered their foods to be confiscated to the Roman state; and thencommitting the government to the senate, set out with all his forces,and, pitching a camp, took up a position above Suessula. TheCarthaginian, having at first endeavoured to win over the people ofAcerrae to a voluntary surrender, but finding them resolved, makespreparations for a siege and assault. But the people of Acerrae hadmore spirit than power. Despairing therefore, of the defence of thecity, when they saw their walls being circumvallated, before the linesof the enemy were completed, they stole off in the dead of nightthrough the opening in the works, and where the watches had beenneglected; and pursuing their course through roads and pathlessregions, accordingly as design or mistake directed each, made theirescape to those towns of Campania which they knew had not renouncedtheir fidelity. After Acerrae was plundered and burnt, Hannibal,having received intelligence that the Roman dictator with thenew-raised legions was seen at some distance from Casilinum, andfearing lest, the camp of the enemy being so near, something mightoccur at Capua, marched his army to Casilinum. At that time Casilinumwas occupied by five hundred Praenestines, with a few Romans andLatins, whom the news of the defeat at Cannae had brought to the sameplace. These men setting out from home too late, in consequence of thelevy at Praeneste not being completed at the appointed day, andarriving at Casilinum before the defeat was known there, where theyunited themselves with other troops, Romans and allies, wereproceeding thence in a tolerably large body, but the news of thebattle at Cannae them back to Casilinum. Having spent several daysthere in evading and concerting plots, in fear themselves andsuspected by the Campanians, and having now received certaininformation that the revolt of Capua and the reception of Hannibalwere in agitation, they put the townsmen to the sword by night, andseized upon the part of the town on this side the Vulturnus, for it isdivided by that river. Such was the garrison the Romans had atCasilinum; to these was added a cohort of Perusians, in number fourhundred and sixty, who had been driven to Casilinum by the sameintelligence which had brought the Praenestines a few days before.They formed a sufficient number of armed men for the defence of wallsof so limited extent, and protected on one side by the river. Thescarcity of corn made them even appear too numerous."Book 23,Chapter 18,"Hannibal having now advanced within a short distance of the place,sent forward a body of Getulians under a commander named Isalca, andorders them in the first place, if an opportunity of parley should begiven, to win them over by fair words, to open the gates, and admit agarrison; but, if they persisted in obstinate opposition, to proceedto action, and try if in any part he could force an entrance into thecity. When they had approached the walls, because silence prevailedthere appeared a solitude; and the barbarian, supposing that they hadretired through fear, made preparation for forcing the gates andbreaking away the bars, when, the gates being suddenly thrown open,two cohorts, drawn up within for that very purpose, rushed forth withgreat tumult, and made a slaughter of the enemy. The first party beingthus repulsed, Maharbal was sent with a more powerful body of troops;but neither could even he sustain the sally of the cohorts. Lastly,Hannibal, fixing his camp directly before the walls, prepared toassault this paltry city and garrison, with every effort and all hisforces, and having completely surrounded the city with a line oftroops, lost a considerable number of men, including all the mostforward, who were shot from the walls and turrets, while he pressed onand provoked the enemy. Once he was very near cutting them off, bythrowing in a line of elephants, when aggressively sallying forth, anddrove them in the utmost confusion into the town; a good many, out ofso small a number, having been slain. More would have fallen had notnight interrupted the battle. On the following day, the minds of allwere possessed with an ardent desire to commence the assault,especially after a golden mural crown had been promised, and thegeneral himself had reproached the conquerors of Saguntum with theslowness of their siege of a little fort situated on level ground;reminding them, each and all, of Cannae, Trasimenus, and Trebia. Theythen began to apply the vineae and to spring mines: nor was anymeasure, whether of open force or stratagem, unemployed against thevarious attempts of the enemy. These allies of the Romans erectedbulwarks against the vineae, cut off the mines of the enemy bycross-mines, and met their efforts both covertly and openly, till, atlast, shame compelled Hannibal to desist from his undertaking; and,fortifying a camp in which he placed a small guard, that the affairmight not appear to have been abandoned, he retired into winterquarters to Capua. There he kept, under cover, for the greater part ofthe winter, that army, which, though fortified by frequent andcontinued hardships against every human ill, had yet never experiencedor been habituated to prosperity. Accordingly, excess of good fortuneand unrestrained indulgence were the ruin of men whom no severity ofdistress had subdued; and so much the more completely, in proportionto the avidity with which they plunged into pleasures to which theywere unaccustomed. For sleep, wine, feasting, women, baths, and ease,which custom rendered more seductive day by day, so completelyunnerved both mind and body, that from henceforth their past victoriesrather than their present strength protected them; and in this thegeneral is considered by those who are skilled in the art of war tohave committed a greater error than in not having marched his troopsto Rome forthwith from the field of Cannae: for his delay on thatoccasion might be considered as only to have postponed his victory,but this mistake to have bereaved him of the power of conquering.Accordingly, by Hercules, as though he marched out of Capua withanother army, it retained in no respect any of its former discipline;for most of the troops returned in the embrace of harlots; and as soonas they began to live under tents, and the fatigue of marching andother military labours tried them, like raw troops, they failed bothin bodily strength and spirit. From that time, during the whole periodof the summer campaign, a great number of them slunk away from thestandards without furloughs, while Capua was the only retreat of thedeserters."Book 23,Chapter 19," However, when the rigour of winter began to abate, marching histroops out of their winter quarters he returned to Casilinum; where,although there had been an intermission of the assault, thecontinuance of the siege had reduced the inhabitants and the garrisonto the extremity of want. Titus Sempronius commanded the Roman camp,the dictator having gone to Rome to renew the auspices. The swollenstate of the Vulturnus and the entreaties of the people of Nola andAcerrae, who feared the Campanians if the Roman troops should leavethem, kept Marcellus in his place; although desirous himself also tobring assistance to the besieged. Gracchus, only maintaining his postnear Casilinum, because he had been enjoined by the dictator not totake any active steps during his absence, did not stir; althoughintelligence was brought from Casilinum which might easily overcomeevery degree of patience. For it appeared that some had precipitatedthemselves from the walls through famine and that they were standingunarmed upon the walls, exposing their undefended bodies to the blowsof the missile weapons. Gracchus, grieved at the intelligence, but notdaring to fight contrary to the injunctions of the dictator, and yetaware that he must fight if he openly attempted to convey inprovisions, and having no hope of introducing them clandestinely,collected corn from all parts of the surrounding country, and fillingseveral casks sent a message to the magistrate to Casilinum, directingthat they might catch the casks which the river would bring down. Thefollowing night, while all were intent upon the river, and the hopesexcited by the message from the Romans, the casks sent came floatingdown the centre of the stream, and the corn was equally distributedamong them all. This was repeated the second and third day; they weresent off and arrived during the same night; and hence they escaped thenotice of the enemy's guards. But afterwards, the river, rendered morethan ordinarily rapid by continual rains, drove the casks by a crosscurrent to the bank which the enemy were guarding; there they werediscovered sticking among the osiers which grew along the banks; and,it being reported to Hannibal, from that time the watches were keptmore strictly, that nothing sent to the city by the Vulturnus mightescape notice. However, nuts poured out at the Roman camp floated downthe centre of the river to Casilinum, and were caught with hurdles. Atlength they were reduced to such a degree of want, that theyendeavoured to chew the thongs and skins which they tore from theirshields, after softening them in warm water; nor did they abstain frommice or any other kind of animals. They even dug up every kind of herband root from the lowest mounds of their wall; and when the enemy hadploughed over all the ground producing herbage which was without thewall, they threw in turnip seed, so that Hannibal exclaimed, Must Isit here at Casilinum even till these spring up? and he, who up tothat time had not lent an ear to any terms, then at length allowedhimself to be treated with respecting the ransom of the free persons.Seven ounces of gold for each person were agreed upon as the price;and then, under a promise of protection, they surrendered themselves.They were kept in chains till the whole of the gold was paid, afterwhich they were sent back to Cumae, in fulfilment of the promise. Thisaccount is more credible than that they were slain by a body ofcavalry, which was sent to attack them as they were going away. Theywere for the most part Praenestines. Out of the five hundred andseventy who formed the garrison, almost one half were destroyed bysword or famine; the rest returned safe to Praeneste with theirpraetor Manicius, who had formerly been a scribe. His statue placed inthe forum at Praeneste, clad in a coat of mail, with a gown on, andwith the head covered, formed an evidence of this account; as did alsothree images with this legend inscribed on a brazen plate, ""Maniciusvowed these in behalf of the soldiers who were in the garrison atCasilinum."" The same legend was inscribed under three images placed inthe temple of Fortune."Book 23,Chapter 20,"The town of Casilinum was restored to the Campanians, strengthenedby a garrison of seven hundred soldiers from the army of Hannibal,lest on the departure of the Carthaginian from it, the Romans shouldassault it. To the Praenestine soldiers the Roman senate voted doublepay and exemption from military service for five years. On beingoffered the freedom of the state, in consideration of their valor,they would not make the exchange. The account of the fate of thePerusians is less clear, as no light is thrown upon it by any monumentof their own, or any decree of the Romans. At the same time thePetelini, the only Bruttian state which had continued in the Romanalliance, were attacked not only by the Carthaginians, who were inpossession of the surrounding country, but also by the rest of theBruttian states, on account of their having adopted a separate policy.The Petelini, unable to bear up against these distresses, sentambassadors to Rome to solicit aid, whose prayers and entreaties (foron being told that they must themselves take measures for their ownsafety, they gave themselves up to piteous lamentations in thevestibule of the senate-house) excited the deepest commiseration inthe fathers and the people. On the question being proposed a secondtime to the fathers by Manius Pomponius, the praetor, after examiningall the resources of the empire, they were compelled to confess thatthey had no longer any protection for their distant allies, and bidthem return home, and having done every thing which could be expectedfrom faithful allies, as to what remained to take measures for theirown security in the present state of fortune. On the result of thisembassy being reported to the Petelini, their senate was suddenlyseized with such violent grief and dismay, that some advised that theyshould run away wherever each man could find an asylum, and abandonthe city. Some advised, that as they were deserted by their ancientallies, they should unite themselves with the rest of the Bruttianstates, and through them surrender themselves to Hannibal. The opinionhowever which prevailed was that of those who thought that nothingshould be done in haste and rashly, and that they should take thewhole matter into their consideration again. The next day, when theyhad cooled upon it, and their trepidation had somewhat subsided, theprincipal men carried their point that they should collect all theirproperty out of the fields, and fortify the city and the walls."Book 23,Chapter 21,"Much about the same time letters were brought from Sicily andSardinia. That of Titus Otacilius the propraetor was first read in thesenate. It stated that Lucius Furius the praetor had arrived atLilybaeum from Africa with his fleet. That he himself, having beenseverely wounded, was in imminent danger of his life; that neither paynor corn was punctually furnished to the soldiers or the marines; norwere there any resources from which they could be furnished. That heearnestly advised that such supplies should be sent with all possibleexpedition; and that, if it was thought proper, they should send oneof the new praetors to succeed him.Nearly the same intelligence respecting corn and pay was conveyed in aletter from Aulus Cornelius Mammula, the propraetor, from Sardinia.The answer to both was, that there were no resources from whence theycould be supplied, and orders were given to them that they shouldthemselves provide for their fleets and armies. Titus Otacilius havingsent ambassadors to Hiero, the only source of assistance the Romanshad, received as much money as was wanting to pay the troops and asupply of corn for six months. In Sardinia, the allied statescontributed liberally to Cornelius. The scarcity of money at Rome alsowas so great, that on the proposal of Marcus Minucius, plebeiantribune, a financial triumvirate was appointed, consisting of LuciusAemilius Papus, who had been consul and censor, Marcus AtiliusRegulus, who had been twice consul, and Lucius Scribonius Libo, whowas then plebeian tribune. Marcus and Caius Atilius were also createda duumvirate for dedicating the temple of Concord, which LuciusManlius had vowed when praetor. Three pontiffs were also created,Quintus Caecilius Metellus, Quintus Fabius Maximus, and QuintusFulvius Flaccus, in the room of Publius Scantinius deceased, and ofLucius Aemilius Paulus the consul, and of Quintus Aelius Paetus, whohad fallen in the battle of Cannae."Book 23,Chapter 22,"The fathers having repaired, as far as human counsels could effectit, the other losses from a continued series of unfortunate events, atlength turned their attention on themselves, on the emptiness of thesenate-house, and the paucity of those who assembled for publicdeliberation. For the senate-roll had not been reviewed since thecensorship of Lucius Aemilius and C. Flaminius, though unfortunatebattles, during a period of five years, as well as the privatecasualties of each, had carried off so many senators. ManiusPomponius, the praetor, as the dictator was now gone to the army afterthe loss of Casilinum, at the earnest request of all, brought in abill upon the subject. When Spurius Carvilius, after having lamentedin a long speech not only the scantiness of the senate, but thefewness of citizens who were eligible into that body, with the designof making up the numbers of the senate and uniting more closely theRomans and the Latin confederacy, declared that he strongly advisedthat the freedom of the state should be conferred upon two senatorsfrom each of the Latin states, if the Roman fathers thought proper,who might be chosen into the senate to supply the places of thedeceased senators. This proposition the fathers listened to with nomore equanimity than formerly to the request when made by the Latinsthemselves. A loud and violent expression of disapprobation ranthrough the whole senate-house. In particular, Manlius reminded themthat there was still existing a man of that stock, from which thatconsul was descended who formerly threatened in the Capitol that hewould with his own hand put to death any Latin senator he saw in thathouse. Upon which Quintus Fabius Maximus said, ""that never was anysubject introduced into the senate at a juncture more unseasonablethan the present, when a question had been touched upon which wouldstill further irritate the minds of the allies, who were alreadyhesitating and wavering in their allegiance. That that rash suggestionof one individual ought to be annihilated by the silence of the wholebody; and that if there ever was a declaration in that house whichought to be buried in profound and inviolable silence, surely thatabove all others was one which deserved to be covered and consigned todarkness and oblivion, and looked upon as if it had never been made.""This put a stop to the mention of the subject. They determined that adictator should be created for the purpose of reviewing the senate,and that he should be one who had been a censor, and was the oldestliving of those who had held that office. They likewise gave ordersthat Caius Terentius, the consul, should be called home to nominate adictator; who, leaving his troops in Apulia, returned to Rome withgreat expedition; and, according to custom, on the following nightnominated Marcus Fabius Buteo dictator, for six months, without amaster of the horse, in pursuance of the decree of the senate."Book 23,Chapter 23,"He having mounted the rostrum attended by the lictors, declared,that he neither approved of there being two dictators at one time,which had never been done before, nor of his being appointed dictatorwithout a master of the horse; nor of the censorian authority beingcommitted to one person, and to the same person a second time; northat command should be given to a dictator for six months, unless hewas created for active operations. That he would himself restrainwithin proper bounds those irregularities which chance, the exigenciesof the times, and necessity had occasioned. For he would not removeany of those whom the censors Flaminius and Aemilius had elected intothe senate; but would merely order that their names should betranscribed and read over, that one man might not exercise the powerof deciding and determining on the character and morals of a senator;and would so elect in place of deceased members, that one rank shouldappear to be preferred to another, and not man to man. The oldsenate-roll having been read, he chose as successors to the deceased,first those who had filled a curule office since the censorship ofFlaminius and Aemilius, but had not yet been elected into the senate,as each had been earliest created. He next chose those who had beenaediles, plebeian tribunes, or quaestors; then of those who had neverfilled the office of magistrate, he selected such as had spoils takenfrom an enemy fixed up at their homes, or had received a civic crown.Having thus elected one hundred and seventy-seven senators, with theentire approbation of his countrymen, he instantly abdicated hisoffice, and, bidding the lictors depart, he descended from the rostrumas a private citizen, and mingled with the crowd of persons who wereengaged in their private affairs, designedly wearing away this time,lest he should draw off the people from the forum for the purpose ofescorting him home. Their zeal, however, did not subside by the delay,for they escorted him to his house in great numbers. The consulreturned to the army the ensuing night, without acquainting thesenate, lest he should be detained in the city on account of theelections."Book 23,Chapter 24,"The next day, on the proposition of Manius Pomponius the praetor,the senate decreed that a letter should be written to the dictator, tothe effect, that if he thought it for the interest of the state, heshould come, together with the master of the horse and the praetor,Marcus Marcellus, to hold the election for the succeeding consuls, inorder that the fathers might learn from them in person in whatcondition the state was, and take measures according to circumstances.All who were summoned came, leaving lieutenant-generals to holdcommand of the legions. The dictator, speaking briefly and modestly ofhimself, attributed much of the glory Of the campaign to the master ofthe horse, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus. He then gave out the day forthe comitia, at which the consuls created were Lucius Posthumius inhis absence, being then employed in the government of the province ofGaul, for the third time, and Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, who wasthen master of the horse and curule aedile. Marcus Valerius Laevinus,Appius Claudius Pulcher, Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, and Quintus MuciusScaevola, were then created praetors. After the election of themagistrates, the dictator returned to his army, which was in winterquarters at Teanum, leaving his master of the horse at Rome, to takethe sense of the fathers relative to the armies to be enlisted andembodied for the service of the year, as he was about to enter uponthe magistracy after a few days. While busily occupied with thesematters, intelligence arrived of a fresh disaster--fortune crowdinginto this year one calamity after another--that Lucius Posthumius,consul elect, himself with all his army was destroyed in Gaul. He wasto march his troops through a vast wood, which the Gauls calledLitana. On the right and left of his route, the natives had sawed thetrees in such a manner that they continued standing upright, but wouldfall when impelled by a slight force. Posthumius had with him twoRoman legions, and besides had levied so great a number of alliesalong the Adriatic Sea, that he led into the enemy's countrytwenty-five thousand men. As soon as this army entered the wood, theGauls, who were posted around its extreme skirts, pushed down theoutermost of the sawn trees, which falling on those next them, andthese again on others which of themselves stood tottering and scarcelymaintained their position, crushed arms, men, and horses in anindiscriminate manner, so that scarcely ten men escaped. For, most ofthem being killed by the trunks and broken boughs of trees, the Gauls,who beset the wood on all sides in arms killed the rest, panic-struckby so unexpected a disaster. A very small number, who attempted toescape by a bridge, were taken prisoners, being intercepted by theenemy who had taken possession of it before them. Here Posthumiusfell, fighting with all his might to prevent his being taken. The Boiihaving cut off his head, carried it and the spoils they stole off hisbody, in triumph into the most sacred temple they had. Afterwards theycleansed the head according to their custom, and having covered theskull with chased gold, used it as a cup for libations in their solemnfestivals, and a drinking cup for their high priests and otherministers of the temple. The spoils taken by the Gauls were not lessthan the victory. For though great numbers of the beasts were crushedby the falling trees, yet as nothing was scattered by flight, everything else was found strewed along the whole line of the prostrateband."Book 23,Chapter 25,"The news of this disaster arriving, when the state had been in sogreat a panic for many days, that the shops were shut up as if thesolitude of night reigned through the city; the senate gave it incharge to the aediles to go round the city, cause the shops to beopened, and this appearance of public affliction to be removed. ThenTitus Sempronius, having assembled the senate, consoled and encouragedthe fathers, requesting, ""that they who had sustained the defeat atCannae with so much magnanimity would not now be cast down with lesscalamities. That if their arms should prosper, as he hoped they would,against Hannibal and the Carthaginians, the war with the Gauls mightbe suspended and deferred without hazard. The gods and the Romanpeople would have it in their power to revenge the treachery of theGauls another time. That they should now deliberate about theCarthaginian foe, and the forces with which the war was to beprosecuted."" He first laid before them the number of foot and horse,as well citizens as allies, that were in the dictator's army. ThenMarcellus gave an account of the amount in his. Those who knew wereasked what troops were in Apulia with Caius Terentius Varro theconsul. But no practicable plan could be devised for raising consulararmies sufficient to support so important a war. For this reason,notwithstanding a just resentment irritated them, they determined thatGaul should be passed over for that year. The dictator's army wasassigned to the consul; and they ordered such of the troops ofMarcellus's army as had fled from Cannae, to be transported intoSicily, to serve there as long as the war continued in Italy. Thither,likewise, were ordered to be sent as unfit to serve with him, theweakest of the dictator's troops, no time of service being appointed,but the legal number of campaigns. The two legions in the city werevoted to the other consul who should be elected in the room ofPosthumius; and they resolved that he should be elected as soon as theauspices would permit. Besides, two legions were immediately to berecalled from Sicily, out of which the consul, to whom the citylegions fell, might take what number of men he should have occasionfor. The consul Caius Terentius Varro was continued in his command forone year, without lessening the army he had for the defence of Apulia."Book 23,Chapter 26,"During these transactions and preparations in Italy, the war inSpain was prosecuted with no less vigour; but hitherto more favourablyto the Romans. The two generals had divided their troops, so thatCneius acted by land, and Publius by sea. Hasdrubal, general of theCarthaginians, sufficiently trusting to neither branch of his forces,kept himself at a distance from the enemy, secured by the interveningspace and the strength of his fortifications, until, after muchsolicitation, four thousand foot and five hundred horse were sent himout of Africa as a reinforcement. At length, inspired with freshhopes, he moved nearer the enemy; and himself also ordered a fleet tobe equipped and prepared for the protection of the islands andsea-coasts. In the very onset of renewing the war, he was greatlyembarrassed by the desertion of the captains of his ships, who hadceased to entertain a sincere attachment towards the general and theCarthaginian cause, ever since they were severely reprimanded forabandoning the fleet in a cowardly manner at the Iberus. Thesedeserters had raised an insurrection among the Tartessians, and attheir instigation some cities had revolted; they had even taken one byforce. The war was now turned from the Romans into that country, whichhe entered in a hostile manner, and resolved to attack Galbus, adistinguished general of the Tartessians, who with a powerful armykept close within his camp, before the walls of a city which had beencaptured but a few days before. Accordingly, he sent his light-armedtroops in advance to provoke the enemy to battle, and part of hisinfantry to ravage the country throughout in every direction, and tocut off stragglers. There was a skirmish before the camp, at the sametime that many were killed and put to flight in the fields. But havingby different routes returned to their camp, they so quickly shook offall fear, that they had courage not only to defend their lines, butchallenge the enemy to fight. They sallied out, therefore, in a bodyfrom the camp, dancing according to their custom. Their suddenboldness terrified the enemy, who a little before had been theassailants. Hasdrubal therefore drew off his troops to a tolerablysteep eminence, and secured further by having a river between it andthe enemy. Here the parties of light-armed troops which had been sentin advance, and the horse which had been dispersed about, he called into join him. But not thinking himself sufficiently secured by theeminence or the river, he fortified his camp completely with arampart. While thus fearing and feared alternately, several skirmishesoccurred, in which the Numidian cavalry were not so good as theSpanish, nor the Moorish darters so good as the Spanish targetteers,who equalled them in swiftness, but were superior to them in strengthand courage."Book 23,Chapter 27,"The enemy seeing they could not, by coming up to Hasdrubal's camp,draw him out to a battle, nor assault it without great difficulty,stormed Asena, whither Hasdrubal, on entering their territories, hadlaid up his corn and other stores. By this they became masters of allthe surrounding country. But now they became quite ungovernable, bothwhen on march and within their camp.Hasdrubal, therefore, perceiving their negligence, which, as usual,was the consequence of success, after having exhorted his troops toattack them while they were straggling and without their standards,came down the hill, and advanced to their camp in order of battle. Onhis approach being announced in a tumultuous manner, by men who fledfrom the watchposts and advanced guards, they shouted to arms; and aseach could get his arms, they rushed precipitately to battle, withoutwaiting for the word, without standards, without order, and withoutranks. The foremost of them were already engaged, while some wererunning up in parties, and others had not got out of their camp.However, at first, the very boldness of their attack terrified theenemy. But when they charged their close ranks with their own whichwere thin, and were not able to defend themselves for want of numbers,each began to look out for others to support him; and being repulsedin all quarters they collected themselves in form of a circle, wherebeing so closely crowded together, body to body, armour to armour,that they had not room to wield their arms, they were surrounded bythe enemy, who continued to slaughter them till late in the day. Asmall number, having forced a passage, made for the woods and hills.With like consternation, their camp was abandoned, and next day thewhole nation submitted. But they did not continue long quiet, forimmediately upon this, Hasdrubal received orders from Carthage tomarch into Italy with all expedition. The report of which, spreadingover Spain, made almost all the states declare for the Romans.Accordingly he wrote immediately to Carthage, to inform them how muchmischief the report of his march had produced. ""That if he really didleave Spain, the Romans would be masters of it all before he couldpass the Iberus. For, besides that he had neither an army nor ageneral whom he could leave to supply his place, so great were theabilities of the Roman generals who commanded there, that they couldscarcely be opposed with equal forces. If, therefore, they had anyconcern for preserving Spain, they ought to send a general with apowerful army to succeed him. To whom, however prosperous all thingsmight prove, yet the province would not be a position of ease."""Book 23,Chapter 28,"Though this letter made at first a great impression on the senate,yet, as their interest in Italy was first and most important, they didnot at all alter their resolution in relation to Hasdrubal and histroops. However, they despatched Himilco with a complete army, and anaugmented fleet, to preserve and defend Spain both by sea and land.When he had conveyed over his land and naval forces, he fortified acamp; and having drawn his ships upon dry land, and surrounded themwith a rampart, he marched with a chosen body of cavalry, with allpossible expedition; using the same caution when passing throughpeople who were wavering, and those who were actually enemies; andcame up with Hasdrubal. As soon as he had informed him of theresolutions and orders of the senate, and in his turn been thoroughlyinstructed in what manner to prosecute the war in Spain, he returnedto his camp; his expedition more than any thing else saving him, forhe quitted every place before the people could conspire. BeforeHasdrubal quitted his position he laid all the states in subjection tohim under contribution. He knew well that Hannibal purchased a passagethrough some nations; that he had no Gallic auxiliaries but such aswere hired; and that if he had undertaken so arduous a march withoutmoney, he would scarcely have penetrated so far as the Alps. For thisreason, having exacted the contributions with great haste, he marcheddown to the Iberus. As soon as the Roman generals got notice of theCarthaginian senate's resolution, and Hasdrubal's march, they gave upevery other concern, and uniting their forces, determined to meet himand oppose his attempt. They reflected, that when it was already sodifficult to make head against Hannibal alone in Italy, there would bean end of the Roman empire in Spain, should Hasdrubal join him with aSpanish army. Full of anxiety and care on these accounts, theyassembled their forces at the Iberus, and crossed the river; and afterdeliberating for some time whether they should encamp opposite to theenemy, or be satisfied with impeding his intended march by attackingthe allies of the Carthaginians, they made preparations for besieginga city called Ibera, from its contiguity to the river, which was atthat time the wealthiest in that quarter. When Hasdrubal perceivedthis, instead of carrying assistance to his allies, he proceededhimself to besiege a city which had lately placed itself under theprotection of the Romans; and thus the siege which was now commencedwas given up by them, and the operations of the war turned againstHasdrubal himself."Book 23,Chapter 29,"For a few days they remained encamped at a distance of five milesfrom each other, not without skirmishes, but without going out to aregular engagement. At length the signal for battle was given out onboth sides on one and the same day, as though by concert, and theymarched down into the plain with all their forces. The Roman armystood in triple line; a part of the light troops were stationed amongthe first line, the other half were received behind the standards, thecavalry covering the wings. Hasdrubal formed his centre strong withSpaniards, and placed the Carthaginians in the right wing, theAfricans and hired auxiliaries in the left. His cavalry he placedbefore the wings, attaching the Numidians to the Carthaginianinfantry, and the rest to the Africans. Nor were all the Numidiansplaced in the right wing, but such as taking two horses each into thefield are accustomed frequently to leap full armed, when the battle isat the hottest, from a tired horse upon a fresh one, after the mannerof vaulters: such was their own agility, and so docile their breed ofhorses. While they stood thus drawn up, the hopes entertained by thegenerals on both sides were pretty much upon an equality; for neitherpossessed any great superiority, either in point of the number orquality of the troops. The feelings of the soldiers were widelydifferent. Their generals had, without difficulty, induced the Romansto believe, that although they fought at a distance from theircountry, it was Italy and the city of Rome that they were defending.Accordingly, they had brought their minds to a settled resolution toconquer or die; as if their return to their country had hinged uponthe issue of that battle. The other army consisted of less determinedmen; for they were principally Spaniards, who would rather bevanquished in Spain, than be victorious to be dragged into Italy. Onthe first onset, therefore, ere their javelins had scarcely beenthrown, their centre gave ground, and the Romans pressing on withgreat impetuosity, turned their backs. In the wings the battleproceeded with no less activity; on one side the Carthaginians, on theother the Africans, charged vigorously, while the Romans, in a mannersurrounded, were exposed to a twofold attack. But when the whole ofthe Roman troops had united in the centre, they possessed sufficientstrength to compel the wings of the enemy to retire in differentdirections; and thus there were two separate battles, in both of whichthe Romans were decidedly superior, as after the defeat of the enemy'scentre they had the advantage both in the number and strength of theirtroops. Vast numbers were slain on this occasion; and had not theSpaniards fled precipitately from the field ere the battle had scarcebegun, very few out of the whole army would have survived. There wasvery little fighting of the cavalry, for as soon as the Moors andNumidians perceived that the centre gave way, they fled immediatelywith the utmost precipitation, leaving the wings uncovered, and alsodriving the elephants before them. Hasdrubal, after waiting the issueof the battle to the very last, fled from the midst of the carnagewith a few attendants. The Romans took and plundered the camp. Thisvictory united with the Romans whatever states of Spain were wavering,and left Hasdrubal no hope, not only of leading an army over intoItaly, but even of remaining very safely in Spain. When these eventswere made generally known at Rome by letters from the Scipios, thegreatest joy was felt, not so much for the victory, as for the stopwhich was put to the passage of Hasdrubal into Italy."Book 23,Chapter 30,"While these transactions were going on in Spain, Petilia, inBruttium, was taken by Himilco, an officer of Hannibal's, severalmonths after the siege of it began. This victory cost theCarthaginians much blood and many wounds, nor did any power moresubdue the besieged than that of famine; for after having consumedtheir means of subsistence, derived from fruits and the flesh of everykind of quadrupeds, they were at last compelled to live upon skinsfound in shoemakers' shops, on herbs and roots, the tender barks oftrees, and berries gathered from brambles: nor were they subdued untilthey wanted strength to stand upon the walls and support their arms.After gaining Petilia, the Carthaginian marched his forces toConsentia, which being less obstinately defended, he compelled tosurrender within a few days. Nearly about the same time, an army ofBruttians invested Croton, a Greek city, formerly powerful in men andarms, but at the present time reduced so low by many and greatmisfortunes, that less than twenty thousand inhabitants of all agesremained. The enemy, therefore, easily got possession of a citydestitute of defenders: of the citadel alone possession was retained,into which some of the inhabitants fled from the midst of the carnageduring the confusion created by the capture of the city. The Locrianstoo revolted to the Bruttians and Carthaginians, the populace havingbeen betrayed by the nobles. The Rhegians were the only people in thatquarter who continued to the last in faithful attachment to theRomans, and in the enjoyment of their independence. The samealteration of feeing extended itself into Sicily also; and not eventhe family of Hiero altogether abstained from defection; for Gelo, hisoldest son, conceiving a contempt for his father's old age, and, afterthe defeat of Cannae, for the alliance with Rome, went over to theCarthaginians; and he would have created a disturbance in Sicily, hadhe not been carried off, when engaged as arming the people andsoliciting the allies, by a death so seasonable that it threw somedegree of suspicion even upon his father. Such, with various result,were the transactions in Italy, Africa, Sicily, and Spain during thisyear. At the close of the year, Quintus Fabius Maximus requested ofthe senate, that he might be allowed to dedicate the temple of VenusErycina, which he had vowed when dictator. The senate decreed, thatTiberius Sempronius, the consul elect, as soon as ever he had enteredupon his office, should propose to the people, that they should createQuintus Fabius duumvir, for the purpose of dedicating the temple.Also, in honour of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, who had been consul twiceand augur, his three sons, Lucius, Marcus, and Quintus exhibitedfuneral games and twenty-two pairs of gladiators for three days in theforum. The curule aediles, Caius Laetorius, and Tiberius SemproniusGracchus consul elect, who during his aedileship had been master ofthe horse, celebrated the Roman games, which were repeated for threedays. The plebeian games of the aediles, Marcus Aurelius Cotta andMarcus Claudius Marcellus, were thrice repeated. At the conclusion ofthe third year of the Punic war, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus theconsul entered upon his office on the ides of March. Of the praetors,Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, who had before been consul and censor, had bylot the city jurisdiction; Marcus Valerius Laevinus, the foreign.Sicily fell to the lot of Appius Claudius Pulcher; Sardinia to QuintusMucius Scaevola. The people ordered that Marcus Marcellus should be incommand as proconsul, because he was the only Roman general who hadbeen successful in his operations in Italy since the defeat at Cannae."Book 23,Chapter 31,"The senate decreed, the first day they deliberated in the Capitol,that double taxes should be imposed for that year, one moiety of whichshould be immediately levied, as a fund from which pay might be givenforthwith to all the soldiers, except those who had been at Cannae.With regard to the armies they decreed, that Tiberius Sempronius theconsul should appoint a day for the two city legions to meet at Cales,whence these legions should be conveyed into the Claudian camp aboveSuenula. That the legions which were there, and they consistedprincipally of the troops which had fought at Cannae, Appius ClaudiusPulcher, the praetor, should transport into Sicily; and that those inSicily should be removed to Rome. Marcus Claudius Marcellus was sentto the army, which had been ordered to meet at Cales on a certain day,with orders to march the city legions thence to the Claudian camp.Titus Metilius Croto, lieutenant-general, was sent by Appius ClaudiusPulcher to receive the old army and remove it into Sicily. People atfirst had expected in silence that the consul would hold an assemblyfor the election of a colleague, but afterwards perceiving that MarcusMarcellus, whom they wished above all others to be consul this year,on account of his brilliant success during his praetorship, wasremoved to a distant quarter, as it were on purpose, a murmuring arosein the senate-house, which the consul perceiving, said ""Conscriptfathers, it was conducive to the interest of the state, both thatMarcus Marcellus should go into Campania to make the exchange of thearmies, and that the assembly should not be proclaimed before he hadreturned thence after completing the business with which he wascharged, in order that you might have him as consul whom the situationof the republic required and yourselves prefer."" Thus nothing was saidabout the assembly till Marcellus returned. Meanwhile Quintus FabiusMaximus and Titus Otacilius Crassus were created duumvirs fordedicating temples, Otacilius to Mens, Fabius to Venus Erycina. Bothare situated in the Capitol, and separated by one channel. It wasafterwards proposed to the people, to make Roman citizens of the threehundred Campanian horsemen who had returned to Rome after havingfaithfully served their period, and also that they should beconsidered to have been citizens of Cumae from the day before that onwhich the Campanians had revolted from the Roman people. It had been aprincipal inducement to this proposition, that they themselves saidthey knew not to what people they belonged, having left their formercountry, and being not yet admitted into that to which they hadreturned. After Marcellus returned from the army, an assembly wasproclaimed for electing one consul in the room of Lucius Posthumius.Marcellus was elected with the greatest unanimity, and was immediatelyto enter upon his office, but as it thundered while he entered uponit, the augurs were summoned, who pronounced that they considered thecreation formal, and the fathers spread a report that the gods weredispleased, because on that occasion, for the first time, twoplebeians had been elected consuls. Upon Marcellus's abdicating hisoffice, Fabius Maximus, for the third time, was elected in his room.This year the sea appeared on fire; at Sinuessa a cow brought forth ahorse foal; the statues in the temple of Juno Sospita Lanuvium floweddown with blood; and a shower of stones fell in the neighbourhood ofthat temple: on account of which shower the nine days' sacred rite wascelebrated, as is usual on such occasions, and the other prodigieswere carefully expiated."Book 23,Chapter 32,"The consuls divided the armies between them. The army which MarcusJunius the dictator had commanded fell to the lot of Fabius. To thatof Sempronius fell the volunteer slaves, with twenty-five thousand ofthe allies. To Marcus Valerius the praetor were assigned the legionswhich had returned from Sicily. Marcus Claudius, proconsul, was sentto that army which lay above Suessula for the protection of Nola. Thepraetors set out for Sicily and Sardinia. The consuls issued aproclamation, that as often as they summoned a senate, the senatorsand those who had a right to give their opinion in the senate, shouldassemble at the Capuan gate. The praetors who were charged with theadministration of justice, fixed their tribunals in the public fishmarket; there they ordered sureties to be entered into, and herejustice was administered this year. Meanwhile news was brought toCarthage, from which place Mago, Hannibal's brother, was on the pointof carrying over into Italy twelve thousand foot, fifteen hundredhorse, twenty elephants, and a thousand talents of silver, under aconvoy of sixty men of war, that the operations of the war had notsucceeded in Spain, and that almost all the people in that provincehad gone over to the Romans. There were some who were for sending Magowith that fleet and those forces into Spain, neglecting Italy, when anunexpected prospect of regaining Sardinia broke upon them. They wereinformed, that ""the Roman army there was small, that Aulus Cornelius,who had been praetor there, and was well acquainted with the province,was quitting it, and that a new one was expected. Moreover, that theminds of the Sardinians were now wearied with the long continuance ofrule; and that during the last year it had been exercised withseverity and rapacity. That the people were weighed down with heavytaxes, and an oppressive contribution of corn: that there was nothingwanting but a leader to whom they might revolt."" This secret embassyhad been sent by the nobles, Hampsicora being the chief contriver ofthe measure, who at that time was first by far in wealth andinfluence. Disconcerted and elated almost at the same time by theseaccounts, they sent Mago with his fleet and forces into Spain, andselecting Hasdrubal as general for Sardinia, assigned to him about aslarge a force as to Mago. At Rome, the consuls, after transacting whatwas necessary to be done in the city now prepared themselves for thewar. Tiberius Sempronius appointed a day for his soldiers to assembleat Sinuessa; and Quintus Fabius also, having first consulted thesenate, issued a proclamation, that all persons should convey cornfrom the fields into fortified towns, before the calends of June nextensuing: if any neglected to do so he would lay waste his lands, sellhis slaves by auction, and burn his farm-houses. Not even thepraetors, who were created for the purpose of administering justice,were allowed an exemption from military employments. It was resolvedthat Valerius the praetor should go into Apulia, to receive the armyfrom Terentius, and that, when the legions from Sicily had arrived, heshould employ them principally for the protection of that quarter.That the army of Terentius should be sent into Sicily, with some oneof the lieutenant-generals. Twenty-five ships were given to MarcusValerius, to protect the sea-coast between Brundusium and Tarentum. Anequal number was given to Quintus Fulvius, the city praetor, toprotect the coasts in the neighbourhood of the city. To CaiusTerentius, the proconsul, it was given in charge to press soldiers inthe Picenian territory, and to protect that part of the country; andTitus Otacilius Crassus, after he had dedicated the temple of Mens inthe Capitol, was invested with command, and sent into Sicily to takethe conduct of the fleet."Book 23,Chapter 33,"On this contest, between the two most powerful people in theworld, all kings and nations had fixed their attention. Among themPhilip, king of the Macedonians, regarded it with greater anxiety, inproportion as he was nearer to Italy, and because he was separatedfrom it only by the Ionian Sea. When he first heard that Hannibal hadcrossed the Alps, as he was rejoiced that a war had arisen between theRomans and the Carthaginians, so while their strength was yetundetermined, he felt doubtful which he should rather wish to bevictorious. But after the third battle had been fought and the thirdvictory had been on the side of the Carthaginians, he inclined tofortune, and sent ambassadors to Hannibal. These, avoiding theharbours of Brundusium and Tarentum, because they were occupied byguards of Roman ships, landed at the temple of Juno Lacinia. Thencepassing through Apulia, on their way to Capua, they fell in with theRoman troops stationed to protect the country, and were conveyed toMarcus Valerius Laevinus, the praetor, who lay encamped in theneighbourhood of Luceria. Here Xenophanes, who was at the head of theembassy, fearlessly stated, that he was sent by King Philip toconclude a treaty of alliance and friendship with the Roman people,and that he had commissions to the Roman consuls, senate, and people.The praetor, highly delighted with this new alliance with adistinguished potentate, amidst the desertions of her old allies,courteously entertained these enemies as guests, and furnished themwith persons to accompany them carefully to point out the roads, andinform them what places, and what passes, the Romans or the enemyoccupied. Xenophanes passing through the Roman troops came intoCampania, whence, by the shortest way, he entered the camp ofHannibal, and concluded a treaty of alliance and friendship with himon the following terms: That ""King Philip, with as large a fleet as hecould, (and it was thought he could make one of two hundred ships,)should pass over into Italy, and lay waste the sea-coast, that heshould carry on the war by land and sea with all his might; when thewar was concluded, that all Italy, with the city of Rome itself,should be the property of the Carthaginians and Hannibal, and that allthe booty should be given up to Hannibal. That when Italy wascompletely subdued they should sail into Greece, and carry on war withsuch nations as the king pleased. That the cities on the continent andthe islands which border on Macedonia, should belong to Philip, andhis dominions."""Book 23,Chapter 34,"A treaty was concluded between the Carthaginian general and theambassadors, upon nearly these terms; and Gisgo, Bostar, and Mago weresent as ambassadors with them to receive the ratification of the kingin person. They arrived at the same place, near the temple of JunoLacinia, where the vessel lay concealed in a creek. Setting outthence, when they had got into the open sea, they were descried by theRoman fleet, which was guarding the coasts of Calabria. PubliusValerius Flaccus having sent fly-boats to pursue and bring back theship, the king's party at first attempted to fly; but afterwards,finding that they were overmatched in swiftness, they deliveredthemselves up to the Romans, and were brought to the commander of thefleet. Upon being asked by him who they were, whence they came, andwhither they were going, Xenophanes, having once been prettysuccessful, made up a fictitious story and said, ""that he was sentfrom Philip to the Romans; that he had succeeded in reaching MarcusValerius, to whom alone he had safe access; that he was unable to makehis way through Campania, which was beset with the troops of theenemy."" But afterwards the Carthaginian dress and manners excitedsuspicions of the messengers of Hannibal, and when interrogated, theirspeech betrayed them; then on their companions being removed toseparate places, and intimidated by threats, even a letter fromHannibal to Philip was discovered, and the agreement made between theking of the Macedonians and the Carthaginian. These points having beenascertained, the best course appeared to be, to convey the prisonersand their companions as soon as possible to the senate at Rome, or tothe consuls, wheresoever they might be; for this service five of thefastest sailing vessels were selected, and Lucius Valerius Antias sentin command of them, with orders to distribute the ambassadors throughall the ships separately, and take particular care that they shouldhold no conversation or consultation with each other. About the sametime Aulus Cornelius Mammula, on his return from the province ofSardinia, made a report of the state of affairs in the island; thatevery body contemplated war and revolt; that Quintus Mucius whosucceeded him, being on his arrival affected by the unwholesomeness ofthe air and water, had fallen into a disorder rather lingering thandangerous, and would for a long time be incapable of sustaining theviolent exertion of the war; that the army there, though strong enoughfor the protection of a province in a state of tranquillity, was,nevertheless, not adequate to the maintenance of the war which seemedto be about to break out. Upon which the fathers decreed, that QuintusFulvius Flaccus should enlist five thousand foot and four hundredhorse, and take care that the legion thus formed should be transportedas soon as possible into Sardinia, and send invested with commandwhomsoever he thought fit to conduct the business of the war untilMucius had recovered. For this service Titus Manlius Torquatus wassent; he had been twice consul and censor, and had subdued theSardinians during his consulate. Nearly about the same time a fleetsent from Carthage to Sardinia under the conduct of Hasdrubal,surnamed the Bald, having suffered from a violent tempest, was drivenupon the Balearian islands, where a good deal of time was lost inrefitting the ships, which were hauled on shore, so much were theydamaged, not only in their rigging but also in their hulls."Book 23,Chapter 35,"As the war was carried on in Italy with less vigour since thebattle of Cannae, the strength of one party having been broken, andthe energy of the other relaxed, the Campanians of themselves made anattempt to subjugate Cumae, at first by soliciting them to revolt fromthe Romans, and when that plan did not succeed, they contrived anartifice by which to entrap them. All the Campanians had a statedsacrifice at Hamae. They informed the Cumans that the Campanian senatewould come there, and requested that the Cuman senate should also bepresent to deliberate in concert, in order that both people might havethe same allies and the same enemies; they said that they would havean armed force there for their protection, that there might be nodanger from the Romans or Carthaginians. The Cumans, although theysuspected treachery, made no objection, concluding that thus thedeception they meditated might be concealed. Meanwhile TiberiusSempronius, the Roman consul, having purified his army at Sinuessa,where he had appointed a day for their meeting, crossed the Vulturnus,and pitched his camp in the neighbourhood of Liternum. As his troopswere stationed here without any employment, he compelled themfrequently to go through their exercise, that the recruits, whichconsisted principally of volunteer slaves, might accustom themselvesto follow the standards, and know their own centuries in battle Whilethus engaged, the general was particularly anxious for concord, andtherefore enjoined the lieutenant-generals and the tribunes that ""nodisunion should be engendered among the different orders, by castingreproaches on any one on account of his former condition. That theveteran soldier should be content be placed on an equal footing withthe tiro, the free-man with the volunteer slave; that all shouldconsider those men sufficiently respectable in point of character andbirth, to whom the Roman people had intrusted their arms andstandards; that the measures which circumstances made it necessary toadopt, the same circumstances also made it necessary to support whenadopted."" This was not more carefully prescribed by the generals thanobserved by the soldiers; and in a short time the minds of all wereunited in such perfect harmony, that the condition from which eachbecame a soldier was almost forgotten. While Gracchus was thusemployed, ambassadors from Cumas brought him information of theembassy which had come to them from the Campanians, a few days before,and the answer they had given them; that the festival would take placein three days from that time; that not only the whole body of theirsenate, but that the camp and the army of the Campanians would bethere. Gracchus having directed the Cumans to convey every thing outof their fields into the town, and to remain within their walls,marched himself to Cumae, on the day before that on which theCampanians were to attend the sacrifice. Hamae was three miles distantfrom his position. The Campanians had by this time assembled there ingreat numbers according to the plan concerted; and not far off MariusAlfius, Medixtuticus, which is the name of the chief magistrate of theCampanians, lay encamped in a retired spot with fourteen thousandarmed men, considerably more occupied in making preparation for thesacrifice and in concerting the stratagem to be executed during it,than in fortifying his camp or any other military work. The sacrificeat Hamae lasted for three days. It was a nocturnal rite, so arrangedas to be completed before midnight. Gracchus, thinking this the propertime for executing his plot, placed guards at the gates to prevent anyone from carrying out intelligence of his intentions; and havingcompelled his men to employ the time from the tenth hour in takingrefreshment and sleep, in order that they might be able to assemble ona signal given as soon as it was dark. He ordered the standards to beraised about the first watch, and marching in silence, reached Hamaeat midnight; where, finding the Campanian camp in a neglected state,as might be expected during a festival, he assaulted it at every gateat once; some he butchered while stretched on the ground asleep,others as they were returning unarmed after finishing the sacrifice.In the tumultuous action of this night more than two thousand men wereslain, together with the general himself, Marius Alfius, andthirty-four military standards were captured."Book 23,Chapter 36,"Gracchus, having made himself master of the enemy's camp with theloss of less than a hundred men, hastily returned to Cumae, fearful ofan attack from Hannibal, who lay encamped above Capua on Tifata; nordid his provident anticipation of the future deceive him; for as soonas intelligence was brought to Capua of this loss, Hannibal,concluding that he should find at Hamae this army, which consisted forthe most part of recruits and slaves, extravagantly elated with itssuccess, despoiling the vanquished and collecting booty, marched byCapua at a rapid pace, ordering those Campanians whom he met in theirflight to be conducted to Capua under an escort, and the wounded to beconveyed in carriages. He found at Hamae the camp abandoned by theenemy, where there was nothing to be seen but the traces of the recentcarnage, and the bodies of his allies strewed in every part. Someadvised him to lead his troops immediately thence to Cumae, andassault the town. Though Hannibal desired, in no ordinary degree, toget possession of Cumae at least, as a maritime town, since he couldnot gain Neapolis; yet as his soldiers had brought out with themnothing besides their arms on their hasty march, he retired to hiscamp on Tifata. But, wearied with the entreaties of the Campanians, hereturned thence to Cumae the following day, with every thing requisitefor besieging the town; and having thoroughly wasted the lands ofCumae, pitched, his camp a mile from the town, in which Gracchus hadstayed more because he was ashamed to abandon, in such an emergency,allies who implored his protection and that of the Roman people, thanbecause he felt confidence in his army. Nor dared the other consul,Fabius, who was encamped at Cales, lead his troops across theVulturnus, being employed at first in taking new auspices, andafterwards with the prodigies which were reported one after another;and while expiating these, the aruspices answered that they were noteasily atoned."Book 23,Chapter 37,"While these causes detained Fabius, Sempronius was besieged, andnow works were employed in the attack. Against a very large woodentower which was brought up to the town, the Roman consul raised upanother considerably higher from the wall itself; for he had made useof the wall, which was pretty high of itself, as a platform, placingstrong piles as supports. From this the besieged at first defendedtheir walls and city, with stones, javelins, and other missiles; butlastly, when they perceived the tower advanced into contact with thewall they threw upon it a large quantity of fire, making use ofblazing fire-brands; and while the armed men were throwing themselvesdown from the tower in great numbers, in consequence of the flamesthus occasioned, the troops sallying out of the town at two gates atonce, routed the enemy, and drove them back to their camp; so that theCarthaginians that day were more like persons besieged than besiegers.As many as one thousand three hundred of the Carthaginians were slain,and fifty-nine made prisoners, having been unexpectedly overpowered,while standing careless and unconcerned near the walls and on theoutposts, fearing any thing rather than a sally. Gracchus sounded aretreat, and withdrew his men within the walls, before the enemy couldrecover themselves from the effects of this sudden terror. The nextday Hannibal, supposing that the consul, elated with his success,would engage him in a regular battle, drew up his troops inbattle-array between the camp and the city; but finding that not aman was removed from the customary guard of the town, and that nothingwas hazarded upon rash hopes, he returned to Tifata withoutaccomplishing any thing. At the same time that Cumae was relieved fromsiege, Tiberius Sempronius, surnamed Longus, fought successfully withthe Carthaginian general, Hanno, at Grumentum in Lucania. He slewabove two thousand of the enemy, losing two hundred and eighty of hisown men. He took as many as forty-one military standards. Hanno,driven out of the Lucanian territory, drew back among the Bruttii.Three towns belonging to the Hirpinians, which had revolted from theRomans, were regained by force by the praetor, Marcus Valerius,Vercellius and Sicilius, the authors of the revolt, were beheaded;above a thousand prisoners sold by auction; and the rest of the bootyhaving been given up to the soldiery, the army was marched back toLuceria."Book 23,Chapter 38,"While these things were taking place in Lucania and Hirpinia, thefive ships, which were conveying to Rome the captured ambassadors ofthe Macedonians and Carthaginians, after passing round the whole coastof Italy from the upper to the lower sea, were sailing by Cumae, when,it not being known whether they belonged to enemies or allies,Gracchus despatched some ships from his fleet to meet them. When itwas ascertained, in the course of their mutual inquiries that theconsul was at Cumae, the ships put in there, the captives were broughtbefore the consul, and their letters placed in his hands. The consul,after he had read the letters of Philip and Hannibal, sent them all,sealed up, to the senate by land, ordering that the ambassadors shouldbe conveyed thither by sea. The ambassadors and the letters arrivingat Rome nearly on the same day, and on examination the answers of theambassadors corresponding with the contents of the letters, at firstintense anxiety oppressed the fathers, on seeing what a formidable warwith Macedonia threatened them, when with difficulty bearing upagainst the Punic war; yet so far were they from sinking under theircalamities, that they immediately began to consider how they mightdivert the enemy from Italy, by commencing hostilities themselves.After ordering the prisoners to be confined in chains, and sellingtheir attendants by public auction, they decreed, that twenty moreships should be got ready, in addition to the twenty-five ships whichPublius Valerius Flaccus had been appointed to command. These beingprovided and launched, and augmented by the five ships which hadconveyed the captive ambassadors to Rome, a fleet of fifty ships setsail from Ostia to Tarentum. Publius Valerius was ordered to put onboard the soldiers of Varro, which Lucius Apustius,lieutenant-general, commanded at Tarentum; and, with this fleet offifty ships, not only to protect the coast of Italy, but also to makeinquiry respecting the Macedonian war. If the plans of Philipcorresponded with his letter, and the discoveries made by hisambassadors, he was directed to acquaint the praetor, Marcus Valerius,with it, who, leaving Lucius Apustius, lieutenant-general, in commandof the army, and going to Tarentum to the fleet, was to cross over toMacedonia with all speed, and endeavour to detain Philip in his owndominions. The money which had been sent into Sicily to AppiusClaudius, to be repaid to Hiero, was assigned for the support of thefleet and the maintenance of the Macedonian war. This money wasconveyed to Tarentum, by Lucius Apustius, lieutenant-general, and withit Hiero sent two hundred thousand pecks of wheat, and a hundredthousand of barley."Book 23,Chapter 39,"While the Romans were engaged in these preparations andtransactions, the captured ship, which formed one of those which hadbeen sent to Rome, made its escape on the voyage and returned toPhilip; from which source it became known that the ambassadors withtheir letters had been made prisoners. Not knowing, therefore, whathad been agreed upon between Hannibal and his ambassadors, or whatproposals they were to have brought back to him, he sent anotherembassy with the same instructions. The ambassadors sent to Hannibalwere Heraclitus, surnamed Scotinus, Crito of Beraea, and Sositheus ofMagnesia; these successfully took and brought back their commissions,but the summer had passed before the king could take any step or makeany attempt. Such an influence had the capture of one vessel, togetherwith the ambassadors, in deferring a war which threatened the Romans.Fabius crossed the Vulturnus, after having at length expiated theprodigies, and both the consuls prosecuted the war in theneighbourhood of Capua. Fabius regained by force the townsCompulteria, Trebula, and Saticula, which had revolted to theCarthaginians; and in them were captured the garrisons of Hannibal anda great number of Campanians. At Nola, as had been the case thepreceding year, the senate sided with the Romans, the commons withHannibal; and deliberations were held clandestinely on the subject ofmassacring the nobles and betraying the city; but to prevent theirsucceeding in their designs, Fabius marched his army between Capua andthe camp of Hannibal on Tifata, and sat down in the Claudian campabove Suessula, whence he sent Marcus Marcellus, the proconsul, withthose forces which he had under him, to Nola for its protection."Book 23,Chapter 40,"In Sardinia also the operations of the war, which had beenintermitted from the time that Quintus Mucius, the praetor, had beenseized with a serious illness, began to be conducted by Titus Manlius,the praetor. Having hauled the ships of war on shore at Carale, andarmed his mariners, in order that he might prosecute the war by land,and received the army from the praetor, he made up the number oftwenty-two thousand foot and twelve hundred horse. Setting out for theterritory of the enemy with these forces of foot and horse, he pitchedhis camp not far from the camp of Hamsicora. It happened thatHampsicora was then gone among the Sardinians, called Pelliti, inorder to arm their youth, whereby he might augment his forces. Hisson, named Hiostus, had the command of the camp, who coming to anengagement, with the presumption of youth, was routed and put toflight. In that battle as many as three thousand of the Sardinianswere slain, and about eight hundred taken alive. The rest of the armyat first wandered in their flight through the fields and woods, butafterwards all fled to a city named Cornus, the capital of thatdistrict, whither there was a report that their general had fled; andthe war in Sardinia would have been brought to a termination by thatbattle, had not the Carthaginian fleet under the command of Hasdrubal,which had been driven by a storm upon the Balearian islands, come inseasonably for inspiring a hope of renewing the war. Manlius, afterhearing of the arrival of the Punic fleet, returned to Carale, whichafforded Hampsicora an opportunity of forming a junction with theCarthaginian. Hasdrubal, having landed his forces and sent back hisfleet to Carthage, set out under the guidance of Hampsicora, to laywaste the lands of the allies of the Romans; and he would haveproceeded to Carale, had not Manlius, meeting him with his army,restrained him from this wide-spread depredation. At first their campswere pitched opposite to each other, at a small distance; afterwardsskirmishes and slight encounters took place with varying success;lastly, they came down into the field and fought a regular pitchedbattle for four hours. The Carthaginians caused the battle to continuelong doubtful, for the Sardinians were accustomed to yield easily; butat last, when the Sardinians fell and fled on all sides around them,the Carthaginians themselves were routed. But as they were turningtheir backs, the Roman general, wheeling round that wing with which hehad driven back the Sardinians, intercepted them, after which it wasrather a carnage than a battle. Two thousand of the enemy, Sardiniansand Carthaginians together, were slain, about three thousand sevenhundred captured, with twenty-seven military standards."Book 23,Chapter 41,"Above all, the general, Hasdrubal, and two other nobleCarthaginians having been made prisoners, rendered the battle gloriousand memorable; Mago, who was of the Barcine family, and nearly relatedto Hannibal, and Hanno, the author of the revolt of the Sardinians,and without doubt the instigator of this war. Nor less did theSardinian generals render that battle distinguished by theirdisasters; for not only was Hiostus, son of Hampsicora, slain in thebattle, but Hampsicora himself flying with a few horse, having heardof the death of his son in addition to his unfortunate state,committed suicide by night, lest the interference of any person shouldprevent the accomplishment of his design. To the other fugitives thecity of Cornus afforded a refuge, as it had done before; but Manlius,having assaulted it with his victorious troops, regained it in a fewdays. Then other cities also which had gone over to Hampsicora and theCarthaginians, surrendered themselves and gave hostages, on whichhaving imposed a contribution of money and corn, proportioned to themeans and delinquency of each, he led back his troops to Carale. Therelaunching his ships of war, and putting the soldiers he had broughtwith him on board, he sailed to Rome, reported to the fathers thetotal subjugation of Sardinia, and handed over the contribution ofmoney to the quaestors, of corn to the aediles, and the prisoners tothe praetor Fulvius. During the same time, as Titus Otacilius thepraetor, who had sailed over with a fleet of fifty ships fromLilybaeum to Africa, and laid waste the Carthaginian territory, wasreturning thence to Sardinia, to which place it was reported thatHasdrubal had recently crossed over from the Baleares, he fell in withhis fleet on its return to Africa; and after a slight engagement inthe open sea, captured seven ships with their crews. Fear dispersedthe rest far and wide, not less effectually than a storm. It happenedalso, at the same time, that Bomilcar arrived at Locri with soldierssent from Carthage as a reinforcement, bringing with him alsoelephants and provisions. In order to surprise and overpower him,Appius Claudius, having hastily led his troops to Messana, underpretext of making the circuit of the province, crossed over to Locri,the tide being favourable. Bomilcar had by this time left the place,having set out for Bruttium to join Hanno. The Locrians closed theirgates against the Romans, and Appius Claudius returned to Rome withoutachieving any thing, by his strenuous efforts. The same summerMarcellus made frequent excursions from Nola, which he was occupyingwith a garrison, into the lands of the Hirpini and Caudine Samnites,and so destroyed all before him with fire and sword, that he renewedin Samnium the memory of her ancient disasters."Book 23,Chapter 42,"Ambassadors were therefore despatched from both nations at thesame time to Hannibal, who thus addressed the Carthaginian: ""Hannibal,we carried on hostilities with the Roman people, by ourselves and fromour own resources, as long as our own arms and our own strength couldprotect us. Our confidence in these failing, we attached ourselves toking Pyrrhus. Abandoned by him, we accepted of a peace, dictated bynecessity, which we continued to observe up to the period when youarrived in Italy, through a period of almost fifty years. Your valourand good fortune, not more than your unexampled humanity and kindnessdisplayed towards our countrymen, whom, when made prisoners, yourestored to us, so attached us to you, that while you our friend werein health and safety, we not only feared not the Romans, but not eventhe anger of the gods, if it were lawful so to express ourselves. Andyet, by Hercules, you not only being in safety and victorious, but onthe spot, (when you could almost hear the shrieks of our wives andchildren, and see our buildings in flames,) we have suffered, duringthis summer, such repeated devastations, that Marcellus, and notHannibal, would appear to have been the conqueror at Cannae; while theRomans boast that you had strength only to inflict a single blow; andhaving as it were left your sting, now lie torpid. For near a centurywe waged war with the Romans, unaided by any foreign general or army;except that for two years Pyrrhus rather augmented his own strength bythe addition of our troops, than defended us by his. I will not boastof our successes, that two consuls and two consular armies were sentunder the yoke by us, nor of any other joyful and glorious eventswhich have happened to us. We can tell of the difficulties anddistresses we then experienced, with less indignation than those whichare now occurring. Dictators, those officers of high authority, withtheir masters of horse, two consuls with two consular armies, enteredour borders, and, after having reconnoitred and posted reserves, ledon their troops in regular array to devastate our country. Now we arethe prey of a single propraetor, and of one little garrison, for thedefence of Nola. Now they do not even confine themselves to plunderingin companies, but, like marauders, range through our country from oneend to the other, more unconcernedly than if they were ramblingthrough the Roman territory. And the reason is this, you do notprotect us yourself, and the whole of our youth, which, if at home,would keep us in safety, is serving under your banners. We knownothing either of you or your army, but we know that it would be easyfor the man who has routed and dispersed so many Roman armies, to putdown these rambling freebooters of ours, who roam about in disorder towhatsoever quarter the hope of booty, however groundless, attractsthem. They indeed will be the prey of a few Numidians, and a garrisonsent to us will also dislodge that at Nola, provided you do not thinkthose men undeserving that you should protect them as allies, whom youhave esteemed worthy of your alliance."""Book 23,Chapter 43,"To this Hannibal replied, ""that the Hirpini and Samnites did everything at once: that they both represented their sufferings, solicitedsuccours, and complained that they were undefended and neglected.Whereas, they ought first to have represented their sufferings, thento have solicited succours; and lastly, if those succours were notobtained, then, at length, to make complaint that assistance had beenimplored without effect. That he would lead his troops not into thefields of the Hirpini and Samnites, lest he too should be a burthen tothem, but into the parts immediately contiguous, and belonging to theallies of the Roman people, by plundering which, he would enrich hisown soldiers, and cause the enemy to retire from them through fear.With regard to the Roman war, if the battle of Trasimenus was moreglorious than that at Trebia, and the battle of Cannae than that ofTrasimenus, that he would eclipse the fame of the battle of Cannae bya greater and more brilliant victory."" With this answer, and withmunificent presents, he dismissed the ambassadors. Having left apretty large garrison in Tifata, he set out with the rest of histroops to go to Nola. Thither came Hanno from the Bruttii withrecruits and elephants brought from Carthage. Having encamped not farfrom the place, every thing, upon examination, was found to be widelydifferent from what he had heard from the ambassadors of the allies.For Marcellus was doing nothing, in such a way that he could be saidto have committed himself rashly either to fortune or to the enemy. Hehad gone out on plundering expeditions, having previouslyreconnoitred, planted strong guards, and secured a retreat; the samecaution was observed and the same provisions made, as if Hannibal werepresent. At this time, when he perceived the enemy on the approach, hekept his forces within the walls, ordered the senators of Nola topatrol the walls, and explore on all hands what was doing among theenemy. Of these Herennius Bassus and Herius Petrius, having beeninvited by Hanno, who had come up to the wall, to a conference, andgone out with the permission of Marcellus, were thus addressed by him,through an interpreter. After extolling the valour and good fortune ofHannibal, and vilifying the majesty of the Roman people, which herepresented as sinking into decrepitude with their strength; he said,""but though they were on an equality in these respects, as onceperhaps they were, yet they who had experienced how oppressive thegovernment of Rome was towards its allies, and how great the clemencyof Hannibal, even towards all his prisoners of the Italian name, werebound to prefer the friendship and alliance of the Carthaginians tothose of the Romans."" If both the consuls with their armies were atNola, still they would no more be a match for Hannibal than they hadbeen at Cannae, much less would one praetor with a few raw soldiers beable to defend it. It was a question which concerned themselves morethan Hannibal whether he should take possession of Nola as captured orsurrendered, for that he would certainly make himself master of it, ashe had done with regard to Capua and Nuceria, and what differencethere was between the fate of Capua and Nuceria, the Nolansthemselves, situated as they were nearly midway between them, werewell aware. He said he was unwilling to presage the evils which wouldresult to the city if taken by force, but would in preference pledgehimself that if they would deliver up Nola, together with Marcellusand his garrison, no other person than themselves should dictate theconditions on which they should come into the friendship and allianceof Hannibal."Book 23,Chapter 44,"To this Herennius Bassus replied, that, ""a friendship hadsubsisted now for many years between the Romans and the Nolans, whichneither party up to that day regretted; and even had they beendisposed to change their friends upon a change of fortune, it was nowtoo late to change; had they intended to surrender themselves toHannibal, they should not have called a Roman garrison to their aid:that all fortunes both were now and should to the last be shared withthose who had come to their protection."" This conference deprivedHannibal of the hope of gaining Nola by treachery; he thereforecompletely invested the city, in order that he might attack the wallsin every part at once. Marcellus, when he perceived that he had comenear to the walls, having drawn up his troops within the gate, salliedforth with great impetuosity; several were knocked down and slain onthe first charge: afterwards the troops running up to those who wereengaged, and their forces being thus placed on an equality? the battlebegan to be fierce; nor would there have been many actions equallymemorable, had not the combatants been separated by a shower of rainattended with a tremendous storm. On that day, after having engaged ina slight contest, and with inflamed minds, they retired, the Romans tothe city, the Carthaginians to their camp. Of the Carthaginians,however, there fell from the shock of the first sally not more thanthirty, of the Romans not one. The rain continued without intermissionthrough the whole night, until the third hour of the following day,and therefore, though both parties were eager for the contest, theynevertheless kept themselves within their works for that day. On thethird day Hannibal sent a portion of his troops into the lands of theNolans to plunder. Marcellus perceiving this, immediately led out histroops and formed for battle, nor did Hannibal decline fighting. Theinterval between the city and the camp was about a mile. In thatspace, and all the country round Nola consists of level ground, thearmies met. The shout which was raised on both sides, called back tothe battle, which had now commenced, the nearest of those cohortswhich had gone out into the fields to plunder. The Nolans too joinedthe Roman line. Marcellus having highly commended them, desired themto station themselves in reserve, and to carry the wounded out of thefield but not take part in the battle, unless they should receive asignal from him."Book 23,Chapter 45,"It was a doubtful battle; the generals exerting themselves to theutmost in exhorting, and the soldiers in fighting Marcellus urged histroops to press vigorously on men who had been vanquished but threedays before, who had been put to flight at Cumae only a few days ago,and who had been driven from Nola the preceding year by himself, asgeneral, though with different troops. He said, ""that all the forcesof the enemy were not in the field; that they were rambling about thecountry in plundering parties, and that even those who were engaged,were enfeebled with Campanian luxury, and worn out with drunkenness,lust, and every kind of debauchery, which they had been indulging inthrough the whole winter. That the energy and vigour had left them,that the strength of mind and body had vanished, by which the Pyreneesand the tops of the Alps had been passed. That those now engaged werethe remains of those men, with scarcely strength to support their armsand limbs. That Capua had been a Cannae to Hannibal; that there hiscourage in battle, his military discipline, the fame he had alreadyacquired, and his hopes of future glory, were extinguished."" WhileMarcellus was raising the spirits of his troops by thus inveighingagainst the enemy, Hannibal assailed them with still heavierreproaches. He said, ""he recognised the arms and standards which hehad seen and employed at Trebia and Trasimenus, and lastly at Cannae;but that he had indeed led one sort of troops into winter quarters atCapua, and brought another out. Do you, whom two consular armies couldnever withstand, with difficulty maintain your ground against a Romanlieutenant-general, and a single legion with a body of auxiliaries?Does Marcellus now a second time with impunity assail us with a bandof raw recruits and Nolan auxiliaries? Where is that soldier of mine,who took off the head of Caius Flaminius, the consul, after dragginghim from his horse? Where is the man who slew Lucius Paulus at Cannae?Is it that the steel hath lost its edge? or that your right hands arebenumbed? or what other miracle is it? You who, when few, have beenaccustomed to conquer numbers, now scarce maintain your ground, themany against the few. Brave in speech only, you were wont to boastthat you would take Rome by storm if you could find a general to leadyou. Lo! here is a task of less difficulty. I would have you try yourstrength and courage here. Take Nola, a town situated on a plain,protected neither by river nor sea; after that, when you have enrichedyourselves with the plunder and spoils of that wealthy town, I willeither lead or follow you whithersoever you have a mind."""Book 23,Chapter 46,"Neither praises nor reproaches had any effect in confirming theircourage. Driven from their ground in every quarter, while the Romansderived fresh spirits, not only from the exhortations of theirgeneral, but from the Nolans, who, by their acclamations in token oftheir good wishes, fed the flame of battle, the Carthaginians turnedtheir backs, and were driven to their camp, which the Roman soldierswere eager to attack; but Marcellus led them back to Nola, amidst thegreat joy and congratulations even from the commons, who hitherto hadbeen more favourable to the Carthaginians. Of the enemy more than fivethousand were slain on that day, six hundred made prisoners, withnineteen military standards and two elephants. Four elephants werekilled in the battle. Of the Romans less than a thousand were killed.The next day was employed by both parties in burying their dead, undera tacit truce. Marcellus burnt the spoils of the enemy, in fulfilmentof a vow to Vulcan. On the third day after, on account of some pique,I suppose, or in the hope of more advantageous service, one thousandtwo hundred and seventy-two horsemen, Numidians and Spaniards,deserted to Marcellus. The Romans had frequently availed themselves oftheir brave and faithful service in that war. After the conclusion ofthe war, portions of land were given to the Spaniards in Spain, to theNumidians in Africa, in consideration of their valour. Having sentHanno back from Nola to the Bruttians with the troops with which hehad come, Hannibal went himself into winter quarters in Apulia, andtook up a position in the neighbourhood of Arpi. Quintus Fabius, assoon as he heard that Hannibal was set out into Apulia, conveyed corn,collected from Nola and Naples, into the camp above Suessula; andhaving strengthened the fortifications and left a garrison sufficientfor the protection of the place during the winter, moved his campnearer to Capua, and laid waste the Campanian lands with fire andsword; so that at length the Campanians, though not very confident intheir strength, were obliged to go out of their gates and fortify acamp in the open space before the city. They had six thousand armedmen, the infantry, unfit for action. In their cavalry they had morestrength. They therefore harassed the enemy by attacking them withthese. Among the many distinguished persons who served in theCampanian cavalry was one Cerrinus Jubellius, surnamed Taurea. Thoughof that extraction, he was a Roman citizen, and by far the bravesthorseman of all the Campanians, insomuch that when he served under theRoman banners, there was but one man, Claudius Asellus, a Roman, whorivalled him in his reputation as a horseman. Taurea having for a longtime diligently sought for this man, riding up to the squadrons of theenemy, at length having obtained silence, inquired where ClaudiusAsellus was, and asked why, since he had been accustomed to disputeabout their merit in words, he would not decide the matter with thesword, and if vanquished give him _spolia opima_, or ifvictorious take them."Book 23,Chapter 47,"Asellus, who was in the camp, having been informed of this, waitedonly to ask the consul leave to depart from the ordinary course andfight an enemy who had challenged him. By his permission, heimmediately put on his arms, and riding out beyond the advanced guardscalled on Taurea by name, and bid him come to the encounter when hepleased. By this time the Romans had gone out in large bodies towitness the contest, and the Campanians had crowded not only therampart of the camp, but the walls of the city to get a view of it.After a flourish of expressions of mutual defiance, they spurred ontheir horses with their spears pointed. Then evading each other'sattacks, for they had free space to move in, they protracted thebattle without a wound. Upon this the Campanian observed to the Roman,""This will be only a trial of skill between our horses and not betweenhorsemen, unless we ride them down from the plain into this hollowway. There, as there will be no room for retiring, we shall come toclose quarters."" Almost quicker than the word, Claudius leaped intothe hollow way. Taurea, bold in words more than in reality, said,""Never be the ass in the ditch;"" an expression which from thiscircumstance became a common proverb among rustics. Claudius havingrode up and down the way to a considerable distance, and again come upinto the plain without meeting his antagonist, after reflecting inreproachful terms on the cowardice of the enemy, returned in triumphto the camp, amidst great rejoicing and congratulation. To the accountof this equestrian contest, some histories add a circumstance which iscertainly astonishing, how true it is, is an open matter of opinionthat Claudius, when in pursuit of Taurea, who fled back to the city,rode in at one of the gates of the enemy which stood open and made hisescape unhurt through another, the enemy being thunderstruck at thestrangeness of the circumstance."Book 23,Chapter 48,"The camps were then undisturbed, the consul even moved his campback, that the Campanians might complete their sowing, nor did he doany injury to the lands till the blades in the corn-fields were grownsufficiently high to be useful for forage. This he conveyed into theClaudian camp above Suessula, and there erected winter quarters. Heordered Marcus Claudius, the proconsul, to retain at Nola a sufficientforce for the protection of the place, and send the rest to Rome, thatthey might not be a burthen to their allies nor an expense to therepublic. Tiberius Gracchus also, having led his legions from Cumae toLuceria in Apulia, sent Marcus Valerius, the praetor, thence toBrundusium with the troops which he had commanded at Luceria, withorders to protect the coast of the Sallentine territory, and makeprovisions with regard to Philip and the Macedonian war. At the closeof the summer, the events of which I have described, letters arrivedfrom Publius and Cneius Scipio, stating the magnitude and success oftheir operations in Spain, but that the army was in want of money,clothing, and corn, and that then crews were in want of every thing.With regard to the pay, they said, that if the treasury was low, theywould adopt some plan by which they might procure it from theSpaniards, but that the other supplies must certainly be sent fromRome, for otherwise neither the army could be kept together nor theprovince preserved. When the letters were read, all to a man admittedthat the statement was correct, and the request reasonable, but itoccurred to their minds, what great forces they were maintaining byland and sea, and how large a fleet must soon be equipped if a warwith Macedon should break out, that Sicily and Sardinia, which beforethe war had wielded a revenue, were scarcely able to maintain thetroops which protected those provinces, that the expenses weresupplied by a tax, that both the number of the persons who contributedthis tax was diminished by the great havoc made in their armies at theTrasimenus and Cannae, and the few who survived, if they wereoppressed with multiplied impositions, would perish by a calamity of adifferent kind. That, therefore, if the republic could not subsist bycredit, it could not stand by its own resources. It was resolved,therefore, that Fulvius, the praetor, should present himself to thepublic assembly of the people, point out the necessities of the state,and exhort those persons who had increased their patrimonies byfarming the public revenues, to furnish temporary loans for theservice of that state, from which they had derived their wealth, andcontract to supply what was necessary for the army in Spain, on thecondition of being paid the first when there was money in thetreasury. These things the praetor laid before the assembly, and fixeda day on which he would let on contract the furnishing the army inSpain with clothes and corn, and with such other things as werenecessary for the crews."Book 23,Chapter 49,"When the day arrived, three companies, of nineteen persons, cameforward to enter into the contract; but they made two requests: onewas, that they should be exempt from military service while employedin that revenue business; the second was, that the state should bearall losses of the goods they shipped, which might arise either fromthe attacks of the enemy or from storms. Having obtained both theirrequests, they entered into the contract, and the affairs of the statewere conducted by private funds. This character and love of countryuniformly pervaded all ranks. As all the engagements were entered intowith magnanimity, so were they fulfilled with the strictest fidelity;and the supplies were furnished in the same manner as formerly, froman abundant treasury. At the time when these supplies arrived, thetown of Illiturgi was being besieged by Hasdrubal, Mago, and Hamilcarthe son of Bomilcar, on account of its having gone over to the Romans.Between these three camps of the enemy, the Scipios effected anentrance into the town of their allies, after a violent contest andgreat slaughter of their opponents, and introduced some corn, of whichthere was a scarcity; and after exhorting the townsmen to defend theirwalls with the same spirit which they had seen displayed by the Romanarmy fighting in their behalf, led on their troops to attack thelargest of the camps, in which Hasdrubal had the command. To this campthe two other generals of the Carthaginians with their armies came,seeing that the great business was to be done there. They thereforesallied from the camp and fought. Of the enemy engaged there weresixty thousand; of the Romans about sixteen; the victory, however, wasso decisive, that the Romans slew more than their own number of theenemy, and captured more than three thousand, with nearly a thousandhorses and fifty-nine military standards, five elephants having beenslain in the battle. They made themselves masters of the three campson that day. The siege of Illiturgi having been raised, theCarthaginian armies were led away to the siege of Intibili; the forceshaving been recruited out of that province, which was, above allothers, fond of war, provided there was any plunder or pay to beobtained, and at that time had an abundance of young men. A secondregular engagement took place, attended with the same fortune to bothparties; in which above three thousand of the enemy were slain, morethan two thousand captured, together with forty-two standards and nineelephants. Then, indeed, almost all the people of Spain came over tothe Romans, and the achievements in Spain during that summer were muchmore important than those in Italy."Book 24,Chapter 1,"On his return from Campania into Bruttium, Hanno, with theassistance and under the guidance of the Bruttians, made an attemptupon the Greek cities; which were the more disposed to continue inalliance with the Romans, because they perceived that the Bruttians,whom they feared and hated, had taken part with the Carthaginians. Thefirst place attempted was Rhegium, where several days were spentwithout effect. Meanwhile the Locrians hastily conveyed from thecountry into the city, corn, wood, and other things necessary fortheir use, as also that no booty might be left for the enemy. Thenumber of persons which poured out of every gate increased daily, tillat length those only were left in the city whose duty it was to repairthe walls and gates, and to collect weapons in the fortresses. Againstthis mixed multitude, composed of persons of all ages and ranks, whilerambling through the country, and for the most part unarmed, Hamilcar,the Carthaginian, sent out his cavalry, who, having been forbidden tohurt any one, only interposed their squadrons, so as to cut them offfrom the city when dispersed in flight. The general himself, havingposted himself upon an eminence which commanded a view of the countryand the city, ordered a cohort of Bruttians to approach the walls,call out the leaders of the Locrians to a conference, and promisingthem the friendship of Hannibal, exhort them to deliver up the city.At first the Bruttians were not believed in any thing they stated inthe conference, but afterwards, when the Carthaginian appeared on thehills, and a few who had fled back to the city brought intelligencethat all the rest of the multitude were in the power of the enemy,overcome with fear, they said they would consult the people. Anassembly of the people was immediately called, when, as all the mostfickle of the inhabitants were desirous of a change of measures and anew alliance, and those whose friends were cut off by the enemywithout the city, had their minds bound as if they had given hostages,while a few rather silently approved of a constant fidelity thanventured to support the opinion they approved, the city wassurrendered to the Carthaginians, with an appearance of perfectunanimity. Lucius Atilius, the captain of the garrison, together withthe Roman soldiers who were with him, having been privately led downto the port, and put on board a ship, that they might be conveyed toRhegium, Hamilcar and the Carthaginians were received into the city oncondition that an alliance should be formed on equal terms; whichcondition, when they had surrendered, the Carthaginian had very nearlynot performed, as he accused them of having sent away the Romanfraudulently, while the Locrians alleged that he had spontaneouslyfled. A body of cavalry went in pursuit of the fugitives, in case thetide might happen to detain them in the strait, or might carry theships to land. The persons whom they were in pursuit of they did notovertake, but they descried some ships passing over the strait fromMessana to Rhegium. These contained Roman troops sent by the praetor,Claudius, to occupy the city with a garrison. The enemy thereforeimmediately retired from Rhegium. At the command of Hannibal, peacewas concluded with the Locrians on these terms: that ""they should livefree under their own laws; that the city should be open to theCarthaginians, the harbour in the power of the Locrians. That theiralliance should rest on the principle, that the Carthaginian shouldhelp the Locrian and the Locrian the Carthaginian in peace and war."""Book 24,Chapter 2,"Thus the Carthaginian troops were led back from the strait, whilethe Bruttians loudly complained that Locri and Rhegium, cities whichthey had fixed in their minds that they should have the plundering of,they had left untouched. Having therefore levied and armed fifteenthousand of their own youth, they set out by themselves to lay siegeto Croto, which was also a Greek city, and on the coast, believingthat they would obtain a great accession to their power, if they couldget possession of a city upon the sea-coast, which had a port and wasstrongly defended by walls. This consideration annoyed them, that theyneither could venture on the business without calling in theCarthaginians to their assistance, lest they should appear to havedone any thing in a manner unbecoming allies, and on the other hand,lest, if the Carthaginian general should again show himself to havebeen rather an umpire of peace than an auxiliary in war, they shouldfight in vain against the liberty of Croto, as before in the affair ofthe Locrians. The most advisable course, therefore, appeared to be,that ambassadors should be sent to Hannibal, and that a stipulationshould be obtained from him that Croto, when reduced, should be inpossession of the Bruttians. Hannibal replied, that it was a questionwhich should be determined by persons on the spot, and referred themto Hanno, from whom they could obtain no decisive answer. For theywere unwilling that so celebrated and opulent a city should beplundered, and were in hopes that if the Bruttians should attack it,while the Carthaginians did not ostensibly approve or assist in theattack, the inhabitants would the more readily come over to them. TheCrotonians were not united either in their measures or wishes. All thestates of Italy were infected with one disease, as it were, thecommons dissented from the nobles, the senate favouring the Romans,while the commons endeavoured to draw the states over to theCarthaginians. A deserter announced to the Bruttii that such adissension prevailed in the city, that Aristomachus was the leader ofthe commons, and the adviser of the surrender of the city, that thecity was of wide extent and thinly inhabited, that the walls in everypart were in ruins, that it was only here and there that the guardsand watches were kept by senators, and that wherever the commons keptguard, there an entrance lay open. Under the direction and guidance ofthe deserter, the Bruttians completely invested the city, and beingreceived into it by the commons, got possession of every part, exceptthe citadel, on the first assault. The nobles held the citadel, whichthey had taken care beforehand to have ready as a refuge against suchan event. In the same place Aristomachus took refuge, as though he hadadvised the surrender of the city to the Carthaginians, and not to theBruttians."Book 24,Chapter 3,"The wall of the city of Croto in circuit extended through a spaceof twelve miles, before the arrival of Pyrrhus in Italy. After thedevastation occasioned by that war, scarcely half the city wasinhabited. The river which had flowed through the middle of the town,now ran on the outside of the parts which were occupied by buildings,and the citadel was at a distance from the inhabited parts. Six milesfrom this celebrated city stood the temple of Juno Lacinia, morecelebrated even than the city itself, and venerated by all thesurrounding states. Here was a grove fenced with a dense wood and tallfir trees, with rich pastures in its centre, in which cattle of everykind, sacred to the goddess, fed without any keeper; the flocks ofevery kind going out separately and returning to their folds, neverbeing injured, either from the lying in wait of wild beasts, or thedishonesty of men. These flocks were, therefore, a source of greatrevenue, from which a column of solid gold was formed and consecrated;and the temple became distinguished for its wealth also, and not onlyfor its sanctity. Some miracles are attributed to it, as is generallythe case with regard to such remarkable places. Rumour says that thereis an altar in the vestibule of the temple, the ashes of which arenever moved by any wind. But the citadel of Croto, overhanging the seaon one side, on the other, which looks towards the land, was protectedformerly by its natural situation only, but was afterwards surroundedby a wall. It was in this part that Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily,took it by stratagem, approaching by way of some rocks which facedfrom it. This citadel, which was considered sufficiently secure, wasnow occupied by the nobles of Croto, the Bruttians, in conjunctioneven with their own commons, besieging them. The Bruttians, however,perceiving at length that it was impossible to take the citadel bytheir own efforts, compelled by necessity, implored the aid of Hanno.He endeavoured to bring the Crotonians to surrender, under anagreement that they should allow a colony of Bruttians to settlethere; so that their city, desolate and depopulated by wars, mightrecover its former populousness: but not a man besides Aristomachusdid he move; they affirmed, that ""they would die sooner than, mixingwith Bruttians, be turned to the rites, manners, and laws, and soonthe language also of others."" Aristomachus alone, since he was neitherable to persuade them to surrender, nor could obtain an opportunityfor betraying the citadel as he had betrayed the city, deserted toHanno. A short time afterwards ambassadors of Locri, entering thecitadel with the permission of Hanno, persuaded them to allowthemselves to be removed to Locri, and not resolve to hazardextremities. They had already obtained leave from Hannibal to do this,by ambassadors sent for this purpose. Accordingly, Croto wasevacuated, and the inhabitants were conducted to the sea, where theyembarked; and the whole multitude removed to Locri. In Apulia,Hannibal and the Romans did not rest even during the winter. Theconsul Sempronius wintered at Luceria, Hannibal not far from Arpi.Slight engagements took place between them, accordingly as either sidehad an opportunity or advantage; by which the Roman soldiery wereimproved, and became daily more guarded and more secure againststratagems."Book 24,Chapter 4,"In Sicily, the death of Hiero, and the transfer of the governmentto his grandson, Hieronymus, had completely altered all things withregard to the Romans. Hieronymus was but a boy, as yet scarcely ableto bear liberty, still less sovereign power. His guardians and friendsgladly observed in him a disposition which might be easily plungedinto every kind of vice; which Hiero foreseeing, is said to haveformed an intention, in the latter part of his long life, of leavingSyracuse free, lest the sovereignty which had been acquired andestablished by honourable means, should be made a sport of and fallinto ruin, under the administration of a boy. This plan of his hisdaughters strenuously opposed, who anticipated that the boy wouldenjoy the name of royalty, but that the administration of all affairswould be conducted by themselves and their husbands, Andranodorus andZoippus, for these were left the principal of his guardians. It wasnot an easy task for a man in his ninetieth year, beset night and dayby the winning artifices of women, to disenthral his judgment, and toconsult only the good of the state in his domestic affairs.Accordingly, all he did was to leave fifteen guardians over his son,whom he entreated, on his death-bed, to preserve inviolate thatalliance with the Romans, which he had himself cultivated for fiftyyears, and to take care that the young king should, above all things,tread in the steps of his father, and in that course of conduct inwhich he had been educated. Such were his injunctions. On the death ofthe king, the will was brought forward by the guardians, and the youngking, who was now about fifteen, introduced into the public assembly,where a few persons, who had been placed in different parts on purposeto raise acclamations, expressed their approbation of the will; whileall the rest were overwhelmed with apprehensions, in the destitutecondition of the state, which had lost as it were its parent. Thefuneral of the king was then performed, which was honoured more by thelove and affection of his citizens than the attentions of his kindred.Andranodorus next effected the removal of the other guardians, givingout that Hieronymus had now attained the years of manhood, and wascompetent to assume the government; and thus, by voluntarily resigningthe guardianship which he shared with several others, united thepowers of all in himself."Book 24,Chapter 5,"It would scarcely have been easy even for any good and moderateking, succeeding one so deeply rooted in their affections as Hierowas, to obtain the favour of the Syracusans. But Hieronymus, forsooth,as if he was desirous of exciting regret for the loss of hisgrandfather by his own vices, showed, immediately on his firstappearance, how completely every thing was changed. For those who forso many years had seen Hiero and his son Gelon differing from the restof the citizens neither in the fashion of their dress nor any othermark of distinction, now beheld the purple, the diadem, and armedguards, and their king sometimes proceeding from his palace in achariot drawn by four white horses, according to the custom of thetyrant Dionysius. This costliness in equipage and appearance wasaccompanied by corresponding contempt of everybody, capricious airs,insulting expressions, difficulty of access, not to strangers only,but even to his guardians also, unheard of lusts, inhuman cruelty.Terror so great took possession of every body therefore, that some ofhis guardians, either by a voluntary death, or by exile, anticipatedthe tenor of his inflictions. Three of those persons to whom alonebelonged a more familiar access to the palace, Andranodorus andZoippus, sons-in-law of Hiero, and one Thraso, were not much attendedto upon other subjects, but the two former exerting themselves infavour of the Carthaginians, while Thraso argued for the Romanalliance, they sometimes engaged the attention of the young king bytheir zeal and earnestness. It was at this time that a conspiracyformed against the life of the tyrant was discovered by a certainservant, of the same age as Hieronymus, who from his very childhoodhad associated with him on entirely familiar terms. The informer wasable to name one of the conspirators, Theodotus, by whom he himselfhad been solicited. He was immediately seized, and delivered toAndranodorus to be subjected to torture, when, without hesitation, heconfessed as to himself, but concealed his accomplices. At last, whenracked with every species of torture, beyond the power of humanity tobear, pretending to be overcome by his sufferings, he turned hisaccusation from the guilty to the innocent, and feigned that Thrasowas the originator of the plot, without whose able guidance, he said,they never would have been bold enough to attempt so daring a deed, hethrew the guilt upon such innocent men, near the king's person, asappeared to him to be the most worthless, while fabricating his storyamid groans and agonies. The naming of Thraso gave the highest degreeof credibility to the story in the mind of the tyrant. Accordingly hewas immediately given up to punishment, and others were added who wereequally innocent. Not one of the conspirators, though their associatein the plot was for a long time subjected to torture, either concealedhimself or fled, so great was their confidence in the fortitude andfidelity of Theodotus, and so great was his firmness in concealingtheir secret."Book 24,Chapter 6,"Thus on the removal of Thraso, who formed the only bond which heldtogether the alliance with the Romans, immediately affairs clearlyindicated defection. Ambassadors were sent to Hannibal, who sent backin company with a young man of noble birth named Hannibal, Hippocratesand Epicydes, natives of Carthage, and of Carthaginian extraction ontheir mother's side, but whose grandfather was an exile from Syracuse.Through their means an alliance was formed between Hannibal and thetyrant of Syracuse; and, with the consent of Hannibal, they remainedwith the tyrant. As soon as Appius Claudius, the praetor, whoseprovince Sicily was, had received information of these events, he sentambassadors to Hieronymus; who, upon stating that the object of theirmission was to renew the alliance which had subsisted between theRomans and his grandfather, were heard and dismissed in an insultingmanner, Hieronymus asking them sneeringly, ""how they had fared at thebattle of Cannae? for that the ambassadors of Hannibal stated whatcould hardly be credited."" He said, ""he wished to know the truth, inorder that before he made up his mind, he might determine which heshould espouse as offering the better prospect."" The Romans replied,that they would return to him when he had learned to receive embassieswith seriousness; and, after having cautioned, rather than requestedhim, not rashly to change his alliance, they withdrew. Hieronymus sentambassadors to Carthage, to conclude a league in conformity with thealliance with Hannibal. It was settled in the compact, that after theyhad expelled the Romans from Sicily, (which would speedily be effectedif the Carthaginians sent ships and troops,) the river Himera, whichdivides the island in nearly equal portions, should be the limit ofthe Carthaginian and Syracusan dominions. Afterwards, puffed up by theflattery of those persons who bid him be mindful, not of Hiero only,but of king Pyrrhus, his maternal grandfather, he sent anotherembassy, in which he expressed his opinion that equity required thatthe whole of Sicily should be conceded to him, and that the dominionof Italy should be acquired as the peculiar possession of theCarthaginians. This levity and inconstancy of purpose in a hot-headedyouth, did not excite their surprise, nor did they reprove it, anxiousonly to detach him from the Romans."Book 24,Chapter 7,"But every thing conspired to hurry him into perdition. For havingsent before him Hippocrates and Epicydes with two thousand armed men,to make an attempt upon those cities which were occupied by Romangarrisons, he himself also proceeded to Leontium with all theremaining troops, which amounted to fifteen thousand foot and horse,when the conspirators (who all happened to be in the army) tookpossession of an uninhabited house, which commanded a narrow way, bywhich the king was accustomed to go to the forum. The rest stood hereprepared and armed, waiting for the king to pass by. One of them, byname Dinomenes, as he was one of the body-guards, had the taskassigned him of keeping back the crowd behind in the narrow way, uponsome pretext, when the king approached the door. All was doneaccording to the arrangement. Dinomenes having delayed the crowd, bypretending to lift up his foot and loosen a knot which was too tight,occasioned such an interval, that an attack being made upon the king,as he passed by unattended by his guards, he was pierced with severalwounds before any assistance could be brought. When the shout andtumult was heard, some weapons were discharged on Dinomenes, who nowopenly opposed them; he escaped from them, however, with only twowounds. The body-guard, as soon as they saw the king prostrate, betookthemselves to flight. Of the assassins, some proceeded to the forum tothe populace, who were rejoiced at the recovery of their liberty;others to Syracuse to anticipate the measures of Andranodorus and therest of the royal party. Affairs being in this uncertain state, AppiusClaudius perceiving a war commencing in his neighbourhood, informedthe senate by letter, that Sicily had become reconciled to theCarthaginians and Hannibal. For his own part, in order to frustratethe designs of the Syracusans, he collected all his forces on theboundary of the province and the kingdom. At the close of this year,Quintus Fabius, by the authority of the senate, fortified andgarrisoned Puteoli, which, during the war, had begun to be frequentedas an emporium. Coming thence to Rome to hold the election, heappointed the first day for it which could be employed for thatpurpose, and, while on his march, passed by the city and descendedinto the Campus Martius. On that day, the right of voting first havingfallen by lot on the junior century of the Anien tribe, they appointedTitus Otacilius and Marcus Aemilius Regillus, consuls, when QuintusFabius, having obtained silence, delivered the following speech:"Book 24,Chapter 8,"""If we had either peace in Italy, or had war with such an enemythat the necessity to be careful was less urgent than it is, I shouldconsider that man as wanting in respect for your liberty, who would atall impede that zealous desire which you bring with you into theCampus Martius, of conferring honours on whom you please. But sinceduring the present war, and with the enemy we have now to encounter,none of our generals have ever committed an error which has not beenattended with most disastrous consequences to us, it behoves you touse the same circumspection in giving your suffrages for the creationof consuls, which you would exert were you going armed into the fieldof battle. Every man ought thus to say to himself I am nominating aconsul who is to cope with the general Hannibal. In the present year,at Capua, when Jubellius Taurea, the most expert horseman of theCampanians, gave a challenge, Claudius Asellus, the most expert amongthe Roman horsemen, was pitted against him. Against the Gaul who at aformer period gave a challenge on the bridge of the Amo, our ancestorssent Titus Manlius, a man of resolute courage and great strength. Itwas for the same reason, I cannot deny it, that confidence was placedin Marcus Valerius, not many years ago, when he took arms against aGaul who challenged him to combat in a similar manner. In the samemanner as we wish to have our foot and horse more powerful, but ifthat is impracticable, equal in strength to the enemy, so let us findout a commander who is a match for the general of the enemy. Though weshould select the man as general whose abilities are greater thanthose of any other in the nation, yet still he is chosen at a moment'swarning, his office is only annual; whereas he will have to cope witha veteran general who has continued in command without interruption,unfettered by any restrictions either of duration or of authority,which might prevent him from executing or planning every thingaccording as the exigencies of the war shall require. But with us theyear is gone merely in making preparations, and when we are onlycommencing our operations. Having said enough as to what sort ofpersons you ought to elect as consuls, it remains that I shouldbriefly express my opinion of those on whom the choice of theprerogative century has fallen. Marcus Aemilius Regillus is flamen ofQuirinus, whom we can neither send abroad nor retain at home withoutneglecting the gods or the war. Otacilius is married to my sister'sdaughter, and has children by her, but the favours you have conferredupon me and my ancestors, are not such as that I should prefer privaterelationship to the public weal. Any sailor or passenger can steer thevessel in a calm sea, but when a furious storm has arisen, and thevessel is hurried by the tempest along the troubled deep, then thereis need of a man and pilot We are not sailing on a tranquil sea, buthave already well nigh sunk with repeated storms, you must thereforeemploy the utmost caution and foresight in determining who shall sitat the helm Of you, Titus Otacilius, we have had experience in abusiness of less magnitude, and, certainly you have not given us anyproof that we ought to confide to you affairs of greater moment Thefleet which you commanded this year we fitted out for three objects:to lay waste the coast of Africa, to protect the shores of Italy, but,above all, to prevent the conveyance of reinforcements with pay andprovisions from Carthage to Hannibal. Now if Titus Otacilius hasperformed for the state, I say not all, but any one of these services,make him consul But if, while you had the command of the fleetsupplies of whatever sort were conveyed safe and untouched toHannibal, even as though he had no enemy on the sea, if the coast ofItaly has been more infested this year than that of Africa, what canyou have to urge why you should be preferred before all others as theantagonist of Hannibal? Were you consul, we should give it as ouropinion that a dictator should be appointed in obedience to theexample of our ancestors Nor could you feel offended that some one inthe Roman nation was deemed superior to you in war It concernsyourself more than any one else, Titus Otacilius, that there be notlaid upon your shoulders a burthen under which you would fall Iearnestly exhort you, that with the same feelings which wouldinfluence you if standing armed for battle, you were called uponsuddenly to elect two generals, under whose conduct and auspices youwere to fight, you would this day elect your consuls, to whom yourchildren are to swear allegiance, at whose command they are toassemble, and under whose protection and care they are to serve. TheTrasimene Lake and Cannae are melancholy precedents to look back upon,but form useful warnings to guard against similar disasters Crier,call back the younger century of the Amen tribe to give their votesagain"""Book 24,Chapter 9,"Titus Otacilius, vociferating in the most furious manner, that hisobject was to continue in the consulship, the consul ordered thelictors to go to him, and as he had not entered the city, but hadproceeded directly without halting from his march to the CampusMartius, admonished him that the axes were in the fasces which werecarried before him. The prerogative century proceeded to vote a secondtime, when Quintus Fabius Maximus for the fourth time, and MarcusMarcellus for the third time, were created consuls. The othercenturies voted for the same persons without any variation. Onepraetor, likewise, Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, was re-elected; the othernew ones who were chosen, were Titus Otacilius Crassus a second time,Quintus Fabius, son of the consul, who was at that time curule aedile,and Publius Cornelius Lentulus. The election of the praetorscompleted, a decree of the senate was passed, that Quintus Fulviusshould have the city department out of the ordinary course, and thathe in preference to any other should command in the city while theconsuls were absent in the war. Great floods happened twice duringthis year, and the Tiber overflowed the fields, with great demolitionof houses and destruction of men and cattle. In the fifth year of thesecond Punic war Quintus Fabius Maximus for the fourth time, andMarcus Claudius Marcellus for the third time, entering upon theiroffice, drew the attention of the state upon them in a more thanordinary degree, for there had not been two such consuls now for manyyears. The old men observed, that thus Maximus Rullus and PubliusDecius were declared consuls for conducting the Gallic war; that thusafterwards Papirius and Carvilius were appointed to that officeagainst the Samnites, the Bruttians, and the Lucanian with theTarentine people. Marcellus, who was with the army, was created consulin his absence; to Fabius, who was present and held the electionhimself, the office was continued. The critical state of affairs, theexigencies of the war, and the danger which threatened the state,prevented any one from looking narrowly into the precedent, orsuspecting that the consul was actuated by an excessive love ofcommand; on the contrary, they applauded his magnanimity in that whenhe knew the state was in want of a general of the greatest ability,and that he was himself confessedly such an one, he thought less ofthe personal odium which might arise out of the transaction, than ofthe good of the state."Book 24,Chapter 10,"On the day on which the consuls entered on their office, thesenate was assembled in the Capitol, and in the first place a decreewas passed to the effect that the consuls should draw lots, and settlebetween themselves which should hold the election for the creation ofcensors, before they proceeded to join the army. Next, all those whohad the command of armies were continued in their offices, and orderedto remain in their provinces; Tiberius Gracchus at Luceria, where hewas with an army of volunteer slaves; Caius Terentius Varro in thePicenian, and Manius Pomponius in the Gallic territory. Of thepraetors of the former year, it was settled that Quintus Mucius shouldhave the government of Sardinia as propraetor, Marcus Valerius thecommand of the sea-coast near Brundusium, watchful against all themovements of Philip, king of the Macedonians. To Publius CorneliusLentulus, the praetor, the province of Sicily was assigned. TitusOtacilius received the same fleet which he had employed the yearbefore against the Carthaginians. Many prodigies were reported to havehappened this year, which increased in proportion as they werebelieved by the credulous and superstitious. That crows had built anest within the temple of Juno Sospita at Lanuvium; that a greenpalm-tree had taken fire in Apulia; that a pool at Mantua, formed bythe overflowing of the river Mincius, had assumed the appearance ofblood; that it had rained chalk at Cales, and blood at Rome in thecattle market; that a fountain under ground in the Istrian street haddischarged so violent a stream of water, that rolling along with theimpetuosity of a torrent, it carried away the butts and casks whichwere near it; that the public court in the Capitol had been struck bylightning; also the temple of Vulcan in the Campus Martius, a nut-treein the Sabine territory, a wall and gate at Gabii. Now other miracleswere published: that the spear of Mars at Praeneste moved forward ofits own accord; that in Sicily an ox had spoken; that a child in thewomb of its mother cried out Io Triumphe! in the country of theMarrucinians; at Spoletum, that a woman was transformed into a man; atHadria, that an altar, with appearances as of men surrounding it inwhite clothing, was seen in the heavens. Nay, even in the city of Romeitself, after a swarm of bees had been seen in the forum, some personsroused the citizens to arms, affirming that they saw armed legions onthe Janiculum; but those who were on the Janiculum at the time,declared that they had seen no person there besides the usualcultivators of the hill. These prodigies were expiated by victims ofthe larger kind, according to the response of the aruspices; and asupplication was ordered to all the deities who had shrines at Rome."Book 24,Chapter 11,"The ceremonies which were intended to propitiate the gods beingcompleted, the consuls took the sense of the senate on the state ofthe nation, the conduct of the war, what troops should be employed,and where they were severally to act. It was resolved that eighteenlegions should be engaged in the war; that the consuls should take twoeach; that two should be employed in each of the provinces of Gaul,Sicily, and Sardinia; that Quintus Fabius, the praetor, should havethe command of two in Apulia, and Tiberius Gracchus of two legions ofvolunteer slaves in the neighbourhood of Luceria; that one each shouldbe left for Caius Terentius, the proconsul, for Picenum, and to MarcusValerius for the fleet off Brundusium, and two for the protection ofthe city. To complete this number of legions six fresh ones were to beenlisted, which the consuls were ordered to raise as soon as possible;and also to prepare the fleet, so that, together with the ships whichwere stationed off the coasts of Calabria, it might amount that yearto one hundred and fifty men of war. The levy completed, and thehundred new ships launched, Quintus Fabius held the election for thecreation of censors, when Marcus Atilius Regulus and Publius FuriusPhilus were chosen. A rumour prevailing that war had broken out inSicily, Titus Otacilius was ordered to proceed thither with his fleet;but as there was a deficiency of sailors, the consuls, in conformitywith a decree of the senate, published an order that those persons whothemselves or whose fathers had been rated in the censorship of LuciusAemilius and Caius Flaminius, at from fifty to one hundred thousand_asses_, or whose property had since reached that amount, shouldfurnish one sailor and six months' pay; from one to three hundredthousand, three sailors with a year's pay; from three hundred thousandto a million, five sailors; above one million, seven sailors; thatsenators should furnish eight sailors with a year's pay. The sailorsfurnished according to this proclamation being armed and equipped bytheir masters, embarked with cooked provisions for thirty days. Thenfirst it happened that the Roman fleet was manned at the expense ofindividuals."Book 24,Chapter 12,"These unusually great preparations alarmed the Campaniansparticularly, lest the Romans should commence the year's campaign withthe siege of Capua. They therefore sent ambassadors to Hannibal, toimplore him to bring his army to Capua, and tell him that new armieswere levying at Rome for the purpose of besieging it; and that therewas not any city the defection of which had excited more hostilefeelings. As they announced this with so much fear, Hannibal concludedhe must make haste lest the Romans should get there before him; andsetting out from Arpi, took up his position in his old camp at Tifata,above Capua. Leaving his Numidians and Spaniards for the protectionboth of the camp and Capua, he went down thence with the rest of histroops to the lake Avernus on the pretence of performing sacrifice,but in reality to make an attempt upon Puteoli and the garrison in it.Maximus, on receiving intelligence that Hannibal had set out fromArpi, and was returning to Campania, went back to his army, pursuinghis journey without intermission by night or by day. He also orderedTiberius Gracchus to bring up his troops from Luceria to Beneventum,and Quintus Fabius the praetor, the son of the consul, to go toLuceria in the room of Gracchus. At the same time the two praetors setout for Sicily, Publius Cornelius to join his army, Otacilius to takethe command of the sea-coast and the fleet; the rest also proceeded totheir respective provinces, and those who were continued in commandremained in the same countries as in the former year."Book 24,Chapter 13,"While Hannibal was at the lake Avernus, five noble youths came tohim from Tarentum. They had been made prisoners partly at the lakeTrasimenus, and partly at Cannae, and had been sent home by theCarthaginian with the same civility which he had shown towards all theRoman allies. They stated to him that, impressed with gratitude forhis favours, they had succeeded in inducing a large portion of theTarentine youth to prefer his alliance and friendship to that of theRomans; and that they were sent by their countrymen as ambassadors torequest Hannibal to bring his forces nearer to Tarentum; that if hisstandards and camp were within sight of Tarentum, that city would bedelivered into his hands without delay; that the commons were underthe influence of the youth, and the state of Tarentum in the hands ofthe commons. Hannibal after bestowing the highest commendations uponthem, and loading them with immense promises, bid them return home tomature their plans, saying that he would be there in due time. Withthese hopes, the Tarentines were dismissed. Hannibal had himselfconceived the strongest desire of getting possession of Tarentum. Hesaw that it was a city opulent and celebrated, on the coast, and lyingconveniently over against Macedonia. And that as the Romans were inpossession of Brundusium, king Philip would make for this port if hecrossed over into Italy. Having completed the sacrifice for which hecame, and during his stay there laid waste the territory of Cumae asfar as the promontory of Misenum, he suddenly marched his troopsthence to Puteoli to surprise the Roman garrison there. It consistedof six thousand men, and the place was secured not only by its naturalsituation, but by works also. The Carthaginian having waited therethree days, and attempted the garrison in every quarter, without anysuccess, proceeded thence to devastate the territory of Naples,influenced by resentment more than the hope of getting possession ofthe place. The commons of Nola, who had been long disaffected to theRomans and at enmity with their own senate, moved into theneighbouring fields on his approach; and in conformity with thismovement ambassadors came to invite Hannibal to join them, bringingwith them a positive assurance that the city would be surrendered tohim. The consul, Marcellus, who had been called in by the nobles,anticipated their attempt. In one day he had reached Suessula fromCales, though the river Vulturnus had delayed him crossing; and fromthence the ensuing night introduced into Nola for the protection ofthe senate, six thousand foot and three hundred horse. Thedilatoriness of Hannibal was in proportion to the expedition which theconsul used in every thing he did in order to preoccupy Nola. Havingtwice already made the attempt unsuccessfully, he was slower to placeconfidence in the Nolans."Book 24,Chapter 14,"During the same time, the consul, Fabius, came to attemptCasilinum, which was occupied by a Carthaginian garrison; and, as ifby concert, Hanno approached Beneventum on one side from theBruttians, with a large body of foot and horse, while on the otherside Gracchus approached it from Luceria. The latter entered the townfirst. Then, hearing that Hanno had pitched his camp three miles fromthe city, at the river Calor, and from thence was laying waste thecountry, he himself marched without the walls, and pitching his campabout a mile from the enemy, harangued his soldiers. The legions hehad consisted for the most part of volunteer slaves, who chose ratherto earn their liberty silently by another year's service, than demandit openly. The general, however, on quitting his winter quarters, hadperceived that the troops murmured, asking when the time would arrivethat they should serve as free citizens. He had written to the senate,stating not so much what they wanted as what they had deserved; hesaid they had served him with fidelity and courage up to that day, andthat they wanted nothing but liberty, to bring them up to the model ofcomplete soldiers. Permission was given him to act in the business ashe thought for the interest of the state, and, accordingly, before heengaged with the enemy, he declared that the time was now arrived forobtaining that liberty which they had so long hoped for; that on thefollowing day he should fight a pitched battle on a level and openplain, in which the contest would be decided by valour only, withoutany fear of ambuscade. The man who should bring back the head of anenemy, he would instantly order to be set free; but that he wouldpunish, in a manner suited to a slave, the man who should quit hispost; that every man's fortune was in his own hands; that not hehimself alone would authorize their enfranchisement, but the consul,Marcus Marcellus, and the whole body of the fathers, who, on beingconsulted by him on the subject, had left the matter to his disposal.He then read the letter of the consul and the decree of the senate, onwhich they raised a general shout of approbation, demanded to be ledto battle, and vehemently urged him to give the signal forthwith.Gracchus broke up the assembly, after proclaiming the battle for thefollowing day. The soldiers, highly delighted, particularly thosewhose enfranchisement was to be the reward of one day's prowess,employed the remaining time in getting ready their arms."Book 24,Chapter 15,"The next day, as soon as the trumpets began to sound, they werethe first to assemble at the general's tent, armed and ready foraction. When the sun had risen, Gracchus led out his troops to thefield of battle; nor did the enemy delay to engage him. His troopsconsisted of seventeen thousand infantry, principally Bruttians andLucanians, with twelve hundred horse, among which were very fewItalians, almost all the rest being Numidians and Moors. The contestwas fierce and protracted. For four hours neither side had theadvantage, nor did any other circumstance more impede the Romans, thanthat the heads of their enemies were made the price of their liberty.For when each man had gallantly slain his enemy, first, he lost timein cutting off his head, which was done with difficulty amid the crowdand confusion, and secondly, all the bravest troops ceased to beengaged in fight, as their right hands were employed in holding theheads; and thus the battle was left to be sustained by the inactiveand cowardly. But when the military tribunes reported to Gracchus thatthe soldiers were employed not in wounding any of the enemy who werestanding, but in mangling those who were prostrate, their right handsbeing occupied in holding the heads of men instead of their swords, hepromptly ordered a signal to be given that they should throw down theheads and charge the enemy; that they had given evident and signalproofs of valour, and that the liberty of such brave men was certain.Then the fight was revived, and the cavalry also were sent out againstthe enemy. The Numidians engaging them with great bravery, and thecontest between the cavalry being carried on with no less spirit thanthat between the infantry, the victory again became doubtful; when,the generals on both sides vilifying their opponents, the Romansaying, that their enemies were Bruttians and Lucanians, who had beenso often vanquished and subjugated by their ancestors; theCarthaginian, that the troops opposed to them were Roman slaves,soldiers taken out of a workhouse; at last Gracchus exclaimed, thathis men had no ground to hope for liberty unless the enemy were routedand put to flight that day."Book 24,Chapter 16,"These words at length kindled their courage so effectually, andrenewing the shout, as if suddenly changed into other men, they boredown upon the enemy with such impetuosity that they could not longerbe withstood. First, of the Carthaginians who stood before thestandards; then the standards were thrown into disorder; and lastlythe whole line was compelled to give way. They then turned their backsdownright, and fled precipitately to their camp with such terror andconsternation, that not a man made stand in the gates or on therampart; while the Romans, who pursued them so close as to form almosta part of their body commenced the battle anew, enclosed within therampart of the enemy. Here the battle was more bloody as thecombatants had less room to move, from the narrowness of the place inwhich they fought. The prisoners too assisted; for snatching up swordsin the confusion, and forming themselves into a body, they slew theCarthaginians in the rear and prevented their flight. Thus less thantwo thousand men out of so large an army, and those principallycavalry, effected their escape with their commander, all the rest wereslain or taken prisoners. Thirty-eight standards were taken. Of thevictors about two thousand fell. All the booty except that of theprisoners was given up to the soldiery. Such cattle also as the ownersshould identify within thirty days was excepted. When they returned totheir camp loaded with spoil, about four thousand of the volunteerslaves who had fought with less spirit, and had not joined in breakinginto the enemy's camp, through fear of punishment, took possession ofa hill not far from the camp. Being brought down thence the next dayby a military tribune, it happened that they arrived during anassembly of the soldiers which Gracchus had called. At this assemblythe proconsul, having first rewarded the veteran soldiers withmilitary presents, according to the valour displayed, and the servicerendered by each man in the engagement, then observed, with respect tothe volunteer slaves, that he would rather that all should be praisedby him whether deserving it or not, than that any one should bechastised on that day. I bid you, said he, all be free, and may theevent be attended with advantage, happiness, and prosperity to thestate and to yourselves. These words were followed by the most cordialacclamations, the soldiers sometimes embracing and congratulating oneanother, at other times lifting up their hands to heaven, and prayingthat every blessing might attend the Roman people, and Gracchus inparticular; when Gracchus addressed them thus: ""Before I had placedyou all on an equal footing with respect to the enjoyment of liberty,I was unwilling to affix any marks by which the brave and dastardlysoldier might be distinguished. But now the pledge given by the statebeing redeemed, lest all distinction between courage and cowardiceshould disappear, I shall order that the names of those persons belaid before me, who, conscious of their dastardly conduct in thebattle, have lately seceded. I shall have them cited before me, when Ishall bind them by an oath, that none of them, except such as shallhave the plea of sickness, will, so long as they serve, take eithermeat or drink in any other posture than standing. This penalty youwill bear with patience when you reflect that it is impossible yourcowardice could be marked with a slighter stigma."" He then gave thesignal for packing up the baggage; and the soldiers, sporting andjesting as they drove and carried their booty, returned to Beneventumin so playful a mood, that they appeared to be returning, not from thefield of battle, but from a feast celebrated on some remarkableholiday. All the Beneventans pouring out in crowds to meet them at thegate, embraced, congratulated, and invited the troops toentertainments. They had all prepared banquets in the courts of theirhouses, to which they invited the soldiers, and of which theyentreated Gracchus to allow them to partake. Gracchus gave permission,with the proviso that they should feast in the public street. Eachperson brought every thing out before his door. The volunteers feastedwith caps of liberty on their heads, or filletted with white wool;some reclining at the tables, others standing, who at once partook ofthe repast, and waited upon the rest. It even seemed a fittingoccasion that Gracchus, on his return to Rome, should order a picturerepresenting the festivities of that day to be executed in the templeof Liberty, which his father caused to be built on the Aventine out ofmoney arising from fines, and which his father also dedicated."Book 24,Chapter 17,"While these events occurred at Beneventum, Hannibal having laidwaste the territory of Naples, moved his camp to Nola. The consul, assoon as he was aware of his approach, sent for Pemponius thepropraetor, with the troops he had in the camp above Suessula; andthen prepared to meet the enemy and to make no delay in fighting. Hesent out Caius Claudius Nero in the dead of night with the mainstrength of the cavalry, through the gate which was farthest removedfrom the enemy, with orders to make a circuit so as not to beobserved, and then slowly to follow the enemy as they moved along, andas soon as he perceived the battle begun, to charge them on the rear.Whether Nero was prevented from executing these orders by mistakingthe route, or from the shortness of the time, is doubtful. Though hewas absent when the battle was fought, the Romans had unquestionablythe advantage; but as the cavalry did not come up in time, the plan ofthe battle which had been agreed upon was disconcerted and Marcellus,not daring to follow the retiring enemy, gave the signal for retreatwhen his soldiers were conquering More than two thousand of the enemyare said, however, to have fallen on that day; of the Romans, lessthan four hundred. Nero, after having fruitlessly wearied both men andhorses, through the day and night, without even having seen the enemy,returned about sunset; when the consul went so far in reprimanding himas to assert, that he had been the only obstacle to their retorting onthe enemy the disaster sustained at Cannae. The following day theRoman came into the field, but the Carthaginian, beaten even by hisown tacit confession, kept within his camp. Giving up all hope ofgetting possession of Nola, a thing never attempted without loss,during the silence of the night of the third day he set out forTarentum, which he had better hopes of having betrayed to him."Book 24,Chapter 18,"Nor were the Roman affairs administered with less spirit at homethan in the field. The censors being freed from the care of lettingout the erection of public works, from the low state of the treasury,turned their attention to the regulation of men's morals, and thechastisement of vices which sprung up during the war, in the samemanner as constitutions broken down by protracted disease, generateother maladies. In the first place, they cited those persons who,after the battle of Cannae, were said to have formed a design ofabandoning the commonwealth, and leaving Italy. The chief of these wasLucius Caecilius Metellus, who happened to be then quaestor. In thenext place, as neither he nor the other persons concerned were able toexculpate themselves on being ordered to make their defence, theypronounced them guilty of having used words and discourse prejudicialto the state, that a conspiracy might be formed for the abandonment ofItaly. After them were cited those persons who showed too muchingenuity in inventing a method of discharging the obligation of theiroath, namely, such of the prisoners as concluded that the oath whichthey had sworn to return, would be fulfilled by their going backprivately to Hannibal's camp, after setting out on their journey. Suchof these and of the above-mentioned as had horses at the publicexpense were deprived of them, and all were degraded from their tribesand disfranchised. Nor was the attention of the censors confined tothe regulation of the senate and the equestrian order. They erasedfrom the lists of the junior centuries the names of all who had notserved during the last four years, unless they were regularlyexempted, or were prevented by sickness. Those too, amounting to morethan two thousand names, were numbered among the disfranchised, andwere all degraded. To this more gentle stigma affixed by the censors,a severe decree of the senate was added, to the effect that all thosewhom the censor had stigmatized, should serve on foot, and be sentinto Sicily to join the remains of the army of Cannae, a class ofsoldiers whose time of service was not to terminate till the enemy wasdriven out of Italy. The censors, in consequence of the poverty of thetreasury, having abstained from receiving contracts for the repairs ofthe sacred edifices, the furnishing of curule horses, and similarmatters, the persons who had been accustomed to attend auctions ofthis description, came to the censors in great numbers, and exhortedthem to ""transact all their business and let out the contracts in thesame manner as if there were money in the treasury. That none of themwould ask for money out of the treasury before the war was concluded.""Afterwards the owners of those slaves whom Tiberius Sempronius hadmanumitted at Beneventum, came to them, stating that they were sentfor by the public bankers, to receive the price of their slaves, butthat they would not accept of it till the war was concluded. Thisdisposition on the part of the commons to sustain the impoverishedtreasury having manifested itself, the property of minors first, andthen the portions of widows, began to be brought in; the persons whobrought them being persuaded, that their deposit would no where bemore secure and inviolable than under the public faith. If any thingwas bought or laid in for the widows and minors, an order upon thequaestor was given for it. This liberality in individuals flowed fromthe city into the camp also, insomuch that no horseman or centurionwould accept of his pay, and those who would accept it were reproachedwith the appellation of mercenary men."Book 24,Chapter 19,"Quintus Fabius, the consul, was encamped before Casilinum, whichwas occupied by a garrison of two thousand Campanians and sevenhundred of the soldiers of Hannibal. The commander was Statius Metius,who was sent there by Cneius Magius Atellanus, who was that yearMedixtuticus and was arming the slaves and people without distinction,in order to assault the Roman camp, while the consul was intentlyoccupied in the siege of Casilinum. None of these things escapedFabius. He therefore sent to his colleague at Nola, ""That another armywas requisite, which might be opposed to the Campanians, while thesiege of Casilinum was going on; that either he should come himself,leaving a force sufficient for the protection of Nola, or if the stateof Nola required him to stay there, in consequence of its not beingyet secure against the attempts of Hannibal, that he should summonTiberius Gracchus, the proconsul, from Beneventum."" On this message,Marcellus, leaving two thousand troops in garrison at Nola, came toCasilinum with the rest of his forces; and at his arrival theCampanians, who were already in motion, desisted from theiroperations. Thus the siege of Casilinum was commenced by the twoconsuls. But as the Roman soldiers received many wounds as they rashlyapproached the walls, and as they did not succeed satisfactorily intheir attempts. Fabius gave it as his opinion that this, which was asmall matter, though as difficult as more important ones, should beabandoned, and that they should retire from the place, as affairs ofgreater moment were pressing. Marcellus, however, succeeded inpersuading him that they should not go away with their objectunaccomplished, observing that as there were many objects which greatgenerals should not attempt, so when once attempted they should not beabandoned, because the mere report in either case would have importantconsequences. Upon this the vineae and all kinds of military works andengines were applied; in consequence of which, the Campaniansentreated Fabius to allow them to retire to Capua in safety; when afew of them having come out of the town, Marcellus took possessionof the gate through which they passed, and first slew allindiscriminately who were near the gate, and then rushing in, theslaughter commenced in the town also. About fifty of the Campanians,who at first came out of the city, having fled for refuge to Fabius,arrived safe at Capua under his protection. Thus Casilinum wascaptured on an accidental opportunity which occurred during theconferences and delay of those who were soliciting protection. Theprisoners, both those who were Campanians and those who wereHannibal's soldiers, were sent to Rome, where they were shut up in aprison. The crowd of townsmen was distributed among the neighbouringpeople to be kept in custody."Book 24,Chapter 20,"At the same time that the consuls retired from Casilinum, theirobject having been accomplished, Gracchus, who was in Lucania, sent,under a prefect of the allies, some cohorts which he had levied inthat country to ravage the lands of the enemy. These, as they werestraggling in a careless manner, Hanno surprising, retorted upon hisenemy a defeat not much less disastrous than he had himself receivedat Beneventum, and then hastily retired to the territory of theBruttians, lest Gracchus should overtake him. Of the consuls,Marcellus returned to Nola, whence he had come, Fabius proceeded toSamnium to waste the lands, and recover by force the cities which hadrevolted. The Samnites of Caudium suffered the severest devastation;their fields were laid waste by fire for a wide extent, and both menand cattle were conveyed away as booty. The towns of Compulteria,Telesia, Compsa, Melae, Fulfulae, and Orbitanium, were taken by storm.Blandae, belonging to the Lucanians, and Aecae to the Apulians, weretaken after a siege. Twenty-five thousand of the enemy were capturedor slain in these towns, and three hundred and seventy desertersrecovered; who, being sent to Rome by the consul, were all of thembeaten with rods in the comitium, and thrown down from the rock. Suchwere the achievements of Fabius within the space of a few days. Illhealth detained Marcellus from active operations at Nola. The town ofAccua also was taken by storm, during the same period, by the praetorQuintus Fabius, whose province was the neighbourhood of Luceria; healso fortified a stationary camp at Ardonea. While the Romans werethus employed in different quarters, Hannibal had reached Tarentum,utterly destroying every thing whichsoever way he went. In theterritory of Tarentum, the troops at length began to march in apeaceable manner. There nothing was violated, nor did they ever go outof the road; it was evident that this was done not from the moderationof the soldiery, or their general, but to conciliate the affections ofthe Tarentines. However, on advancing almost close to the wallswithout perceiving any movement, which he expected would occur on thesight of his vanguard, he pitched his camp about a mile off the city.Three days before the arrival of Hannibal, Marcus Livius, who had beensent by Marcus Valerius, the propraetor, commanding the fleet atBrundusium, had enlisted the young nobility of Tarentum, andstationing guards at every gate, and round the walls, wherevercircumstances made it necessary, had kept such a strict watch both byday and night, as to give no opportunity for making any attempt eitherto the enemy or doubtful allies. On this account several days wereconsumed there to no purpose, when Hannibal, as none of those who hadcome to him at the lake Avernus, either came themselves or sent anyletter or message, perceiving that he had carelessly followed delusivepromises, moved his camp thence. Even after this he did not offer anyviolence to the Tarentine territory, not quitting the hope of shakingtheir allegiance to the Romans, though his simulated lenity hadhitherto been of no advantage to him; but as soon as he came toSalapia he collected stores of corn there from the Metapontine andHeraclean lands; for midsummer was now past, and the situation pleasedhim as a place for winter quarters. From hence the Moors and Numidianswere detached to plunder the territory of Sallentum, and theneighbouring woods of Apulia, from which not much booty of any othersort was obtained, but principally droves of horses, four thousand ofwhich were distributed among his horsemen to be broken."Book 24,Chapter 21,"The Romans, since a war by no means to be despised was springingup in Sicily, and the death of the tyrant had furnished the Syracusanswith more enterprising leaders, rather than changed their attachmentto the Carthaginian cause, or the state of their minds, decreed thatprovince to Marcus Marcellus, one of their consuls. After theassassination of Hieronymus, at first a tumult had taken place amongthe soldiery in the territory of the Leontines. They exclaimedfuriously that the manes of the king should be appeased with the bloodof the conspirators. Afterwards the frequent repetition of the wordliberty, which was restored to them, a word so delightful to the ear,the hopes they had conceived of largesses from the royal treasury, andof serving in future under better generals, the relation of the horridcrimes and more horrid lusts of the tyrant, effected such analteration in their sentiments, that they suffered to lie unburied thecorpse of the king, whom a little before they regretted. As the restof the conspirators remained behind, in order to keep the army ontheir side, Theodotus and Sosis, mounted on the king's horses, rodeoff to Syracuse with all possible speed, that they might surprise theking's party, while unacquainted with all that had occurred. But theywere anticipated not only by report, than which nothing is swifter insuch affairs, but also by a messenger who was one of the royalservants. In consequence, Andranodorus had occupied with stronggarrisons the Insula and the citadel, and every other convenient partwhich he could. After sunset, when it was now growing dark, Theodotusand Sosis rode in by the Hexapylum, and displayed the royal veststained with blood, and the ornament of the king's head; then passingthrough the Tycha, and calling the people at once to liberty and arms,bid them assemble in the Achradina. Some of the multitude ran out intothe streets, some stood in the porches of their houses, while otherslooked out from the roofs and windows, and inquired what was thematter. Every part of the city was filled with lights and noises ofvarious kinds. Assemblies of armed men were formed in the open spaces.Those who had no arms tore down from the temple of the OlympianJupiter the spoils of the Gauls and Illyrians, which had beenpresented to Hiero by the Roman people, and hung up there by him; atthe same time offering up prayers to Jupiter, that he would willingly,and without feeling offence, lend those consecrated weapons to thosewho were arming themselves in defence of their country, of the templesof their gods, and their liberty. This multitude was also joined bythe watches which were stationed through the principal quarters of thecity. In the island, Andranodorus, among other places, secured thepublic granaries by a garrison. This place, which was enclosed by awall of stones hewn square, and built up on high, after the manner ofa citadel, was occupied by a body of youth, who had been appointed togarrison it, and these sent messengers to the Achradina, to giveinformation that the granaries and the corn were in the power of thesenate."Book 24,Chapter 22,"At break of day the whole populace, armed and unarmed, assembledat the senate-house in the Achradina: where from the altar of Concord,which stood there, one of the nobles, named Polyaenus, delivered aliberal and temperate address. He said, that ""men who had experiencedservitude and contumely, were enraged against an evil which was wellknown, but that the Syracusans had rather heard from their fathersthan seen with their own eyes the disasters which civil discordintroduces."" He said, ""he commended them for the alacrity with whichthey had taken arms; but that he should commend them more if theyshould abstain from using them unless compelled by extreme necessity.At present he advised that ambassadors should be sent to Andranodorus,to charge him to submit to the direction of the senate and the people,to throw open the gates of the island, and withdraw the garrison. Ifhe resolved to usurp the sovereignty of which he had been appointedguardian, that he would recommend that their liberty be recovered moreenergetically from Andranodorus than it had been from Hieronymus.""From this assembly ambassadors were despatched. The senate began nowto meet, which though during the reign of Hiero it had continued to bethe public council of the state, from the time of his death up to thepresent had never been assembled or consulted upon any subject. Whenthe ambassadors came to Andranodorus, he was himself moved by theunanimous opinion of his countrymen, by their having possession ofother parts of the city, and by the fact that the strongest part ofthe island was betrayed and placed in the hands of others; but hiswife, Demarata, the daughter of Hiero, still swelling with the prideof royalty and female presumption, called him out from the presence ofthe ambassadors, and reminded him of the expression so often repeatedby the tyrant Dionysius, ""that a man ought only to relinquishsovereign power when dragged by the feet, and not while sitting onhorseback. That it was an easy thing, at any moment one pleased, togive up possession of grandeur, but that to create and obtain them wasdifficult and arduous. That he should obtain from the ambassadors alittle time to deliberate, and to employ it in fetching the soldiersfrom the Leontines; to whom, if he promised the royal treasure, everything would be at his disposal."" This advice, suggested by a woman,Andranodorus neither entirely rejected nor immediately adopted,considering it the safer way to the attainment of power to temporizefor the present. Accordingly he told the ambassadors to carry wordback, that he should act subserviently to the senate and the people.The next day, as soon as it was light, he threw open the gates of theisland, and came into the forum of the Achradina; then mounting thealtar of Concord, from which Polyaenus had delivered his harangue theday before, he commenced a speech by soliciting pardon for his delay.""He had kept the gates closed,"" he said, ""not as separating his ownfrom the public interest, but from fear as to where the carnage wouldstop when once the sword was drawn; whether they would be satisfiedwith the blood of the tyrant, which was sufficient for their liberty,or whether all who were connected with the court, by consanguinity,affinity, or any offices, would, as implicated in another's guilt, bebutchered. After he perceived that those who had liberated theircountry were desirous of preserving it when liberated, and that thecounsels of all were directed towards the public good, he had nothesitated to restore to his country his own person and every thingelse which had been committed to his honour and guardianship, sincethe person who had intrusted him with them had fallen a victim to hisown madness."" Then turning to the persons who had killed the tyrant,and calling on Theodotus and Sosis by name, he said, ""You haveperformed a memorable deed, but believe me, your glory is onlybeginning, not yet perfected; and there still remains great dangerlest the enfranchised state should be destroyed, if you do not providefor its tranquillity and harmony."""Book 24,Chapter 23,"At the conclusion of this speech, he laid the keys of the gatesand of the royal treasure at their feet; and on that day, retiringfrom the assembly in the highest spirits, they made supplication withtheir wives and children at all the temples of the gods. On thefollowing day an assembly was held for the election of praetors.Andranodorus was created among the first; the rest consisted for themost part of the destroyers of the tyrant; two of these, Sopater andDinomenes, they appointed in their absence. These, on hearing of whathad passed at Syracuse, conveyed thither the royal treasure which wasat Leontini, and put it into the hands of quaestors appointed for thatpurpose. The treasure also in the island and the Achradina wasdelivered to them, and that part of the wall which formed too strong aseparation between the island and the other parts of the city, wasdemolished by general consent. Every thing else which was done was inconformity with this inclination of their minds to liberty.Hippocrates and Epicydes, on hearing of the death of the tyrant, whichHippocrates had wished to conceal even by putting the messenger todeath, being deserted by the soldiery, returned to Syracuse, as thatappeared the safest course under present circumstances; but lest ifthey appeared there in common they should become objects of suspicion,and looked upon as persons who were seeking an opportunity ofeffecting some change, they in the first place addressed themselves tothe praetors and then through them to the senate. They declared, that""they were sent by Hannibal to Hieronymus, as to a friend and ally;that they had obeyed the orders of that man whom their general wishedthem to obey; that they desired to return to Hannibal; but as thejourney would not be safe, as armed Romans were ranging at largethrough the whole of Sicily, that they requested to be furnished withsome escort which might convey them in safety to Locri in Italy; andthat thus they would confer a great obligation upon Hannibal, withlittle trouble."" The request was easily obtained, for they weredesirous of getting rid of these generals of the king, who wereskilled in war, and at once necessitous and enterprising. But they didnot exert themselves so as to effect what they desired with therequisite speed. Meanwhile these young men, who were of a militaryturn and accustomed to the soldiers, employed themselves incirculating charges against the senate and nobles, sometimes in theminds of the soldiers themselves, sometimes of the deserters, of whichthe greater part were Roman sailors, at other times of men belongingto the lowest order of the populace, insinuating, that ""what they weresecretly labouring and contriving to effect, was to place Syracuseunder the dominion of the Romans with the pretence of a renewedalliance, and then that faction and the few promoters of the alliancewould be supreme."""Book 24,Chapter 24,"The crowds of persons disposed to hear and credit theseinsinuations which flowed into Syracuse from every quarter increaseddaily, and afforded hopes, not only to Epicydes but to Andranodorusalso, of effecting a revolution. The latter, wearied at length by theimportunities of his wife, who warned him, ""that now was thefavourable time for seizing the government, while every thing was inconfusion in consequence of liberty being recent and not yet regularlyestablished; while a soldiery supported by the royal pay was to be metwith, and while generals sent by Hannibal and accustomed to thesoldiery might forward the attempt;"" he communicated his design withThemistus, who had married the daughter of Gelon, and a few daysafterwards incautiously disclosed it to a certain tragic actor, namedAriston, to whom he was in the habit of committing other secrets. Hewas a man of reputable birth and fortune, nor did his professiondisgrace them, for among the Greeks no pursuit of that kind wasconsidered dishonourable. He therefore discovered the plot to thepraetors, from a conviction that his country had a superior claim uponhis fidelity. These having satisfied themselves that his statement wasnot false by indubitable proofs, took the advice of the eldersenators, and with their sanction, having placed a guard at the doors,slew Themistus and Andranodorus as soon as they had entered thesenate-house. A disturbance arising in consequence of this act, which,as none but the praetors knew the cause of it, wore an appearance ofatrocity, the praetors, having at length procured silence, introducedthe informer into the senate-house; and after he had in a regularmanner detailed to the senate every particular, showing that theconspiracy owed its origin to the marriage of Harmonia, the daughterof Gelon, with Themistus; that the African and Spanish auxiliaries hadbeen prepared to murder the praetors and others of the nobility; thatit had been given out that their goods were to be the booty of theassassins; that already a band of mercenaries accustomed to obey thecommand of Andranodorus had been procured for the reoccupation of theisland; and having then distinctly represented to them the severalparts which the persons implicated in the transaction were performing,and having brought under their view the entire plot prepared forexecution with men and arms; it seemed to the senate that they hadfallen as justly as Hieronymus had. A shout was raised before thesenate-house by a crowd of people variously disposed and uncertain ofthe facts; but as they were conducting themselves in a furious andmenacing manner, the bodies of the conspirators in the vestibule ofthe senate-house restrained them with such alarm, that they silentlyfollowed the more discreet part of the commons to an assembly. Sopaterwas the person commissioned by the senate and his colleague to explainthe affair."Book 24,Chapter 25,"Treating them as if they stood upon their trial, he began withtheir past lives; and insisted that Andranodorus and Themistus werethe authors of every act of iniquity and impiety which had beenperpetrated since the death of Hiero. ""For what,"" said he, ""did theboy Hieronymus ever do of his own accord? What could he do who hadscarce as yet arrived at puberty? His tutors and guardians had ruled,while the odium rested on another. Therefore they ought to have beenput to death either before Hieronymus or with him. Nevertheless thosemen, deservedly marked out for death, had attempted fresh crimes afterthe decease of the tyrant; first openly, when, closing the gates ofthe island, Andranodorus declared himself heir to the throne, and keptthat as proprietor which he had held only in the capacity of guardian;afterwards, when betrayed by those who were in the island andblockaded by the whole body of the citizens who held the Achradina, heendeavoured to obtain, by secret and artful means, that sovereigntywhich he had in vain attempted openly; whom not even benefits andhonorary distinction could move, for even this conspirator against theliberty of his country was created praetor among her liberators. Butthat wives of royal blood had infected them with this thirst forroyalty, one having married the daughter of Hiero, the other thedaughter of Gelon."" On hearing these words, a shout arose from everypart of the assembly, that ""none of these women ought to live, andthat not one of the royal family should be left alive."" Such is thenature of the populace; they are either cringing slaves or haughtytyrants. They know not how with moderation to spurn or to enjoy thatliberty which holds the middle place; nor are there generally wantingministers, the panders to their resentment, who incite their eager andintemperate minds to blood and carnage. Thus, on the present occasion,the praetors instantly proposed the passing of a decree, which wasconsented to almost before it was proposed, that all the royal familyshould be put to death; and persons despatched for the purpose by thepraetors, put to death Demarata, the daughter of Hiero, and Harmonia,the daughter of Gelon, the wives of Andranodorus and Themistus."Book 24,Chapter 26,"There was a daughter of Hiero, named Heraclea, the wife ofZoippus, who, having been sent by Hieronymus as ambassador to kingPtolemy, had become a voluntary exile. As soon as she was apprizedthat they were coming to her also, she fled for refuge into the chapelto the household gods, accompanied by her two virgin daughters, withdishevelled hair, and other marks of wretchedness. In addition tothis, she had recourse to prayers also; she implored them ""by thememory of her father, Hiero, and her brother, Gelon, that they wouldnot suffer her, a guiltless person, to be consumed by their hatred ofHieronymus. That all that she had derived from his reign was the exileof her husband. That neither did she enjoy the same advantages as hersister while Hieronymus was alive, nor was her cause the same as hersnow he was dead. What? Though her sister would have shared the thronewith Andranodorus, had he succeeded in his designs, she must have beenin servitude with the rest. Can any one doubt, that if informationshould be conveyed to Zoippus that Hieronymus had been put to death,and that Syracuse was free, he would instantly embark and return tohis native land. But how are all human hopes deceived! His wife andchildren are struggling for their lives in his native land, nowblessed with liberty! In what manner standing in the way of liberty orthe laws? What danger could arise to any one from them, from asolitary, and in a manner, widowed woman and girls living in a stateof orphanage? But perhaps it will be granted that no danger is to beapprehended from them, but alleged that the whole royal family isdetested. If this were the case, she entreated that they would banishthem far from Syracuse and Sicily, and order them to be conveyed toAlexandria, the wife to her husband, the daughters to their father.""Seeing that their ears and minds were unimpressed, and that certain ofthem were drawing their swords to prevent a fruitless consumption oftime, she gave over entreating for herself, and began to implore themto ""spare, at least, her daughters, at an age which even exasperatedenemies spared."" She entreated them ""that they would not, in theirrevenge on tyrants, themselves imitate the crimes which were odious tothem."" While thus employed, they dragged her from the sanctuary andmurdered her; and after that they fell upon the virgins, who weresprinkled with the blood of their mother; who, distracted alike byfear and grief, and as if seized with madness, rushed out of thechapel with such rapidity, that had there been an opening by whichthey might have escaped into the street, they would have filled thecity with confusion. As it was, they several times made their escapethrough the midst of so many armed men with their persons uninjured inthe contracted space which the house afforded, and extricatedthemselves from their grasp, though they had to disengage themselvesfrom so many and such strong hands; but at length enfeebled by wounds,and after covering every place with blood, they fell down lifeless.This murder, piteous as it was in itself, was rendered still more soby its happening that a short time after it a message arrived thatthey should not be killed, as the minds of the people were now turnedto compassion. This compassion then gave rise to a feeling of anger,because so much haste had been shown in carrying the punishment intoeffect, and because no opportunity was left for relenting or retracingthe steps of their passion. The multitude therefore gave vent to theirindignation, and demanded an election to supply the places ofAndranodorus and Themistus, for both of them had been praetors; anelection by no means likely to be agreeable to the praetors."Book 24,Chapter 27,"The day was fixed for the election, when, to the surprise of all,one person from the extremity of the crowd nominated Epicydes, andthen another from the same quarter nominated Hippocrates. Afterwardsthe voices in favour of these persons increased with the manifestapprobation of the multitude. The assembly was one of a heterogeneouscharacter, consisting not only of the commons, but a crowd ofsoldiers, with a large admixture even of deserters, who were desirousof innovation in every thing. The praetors, at first, concealed theirfeelings, and were for protracting the business; but at length,overcome by the general opinion, and apprehensive of a sedition, theydeclared them the praetors. These did not, however, immediately openlyavow their sentiments, though they were chagrined that ambassadors hadbeen sent to Appius Claudius to negotiate a ten days' truce, and thaton obtaining this, others were sent to treat for the renewal of theold alliance. The Romans, with a fleet of a hundred ships, were thenstationed at Murgantia, waiting the issue of the commotion raised atSyracuse by the death of the tyrants, and to what their recentacquisition of liberty would impel the people. Meanwhile, theSyracusan ambassadors were sent by Appius Claudius to Marcellus on hiscoming into Sicily, and Marcellus having heard the conditions ofpeace, and being of opinion that matters might be brought to asettlement, himself also sent ambassadors to Syracuse to treat withthe praetors in person on the renewal of the alliance. But now by nomeans the same state of quiet and tranquillity existed there.Hippocrates and Epicydes, their fears being removed, after thatintelligence had arrived that a Carthaginian fleet had put in atPachynum, complained sometimes to the mercenary soldiers, at othertimes to the deserters, that Syracuse was being betrayed to theRomans. And when Appius began to station his ships at the mouth of theport, in order to inspire the other party with courage, their falseinsinuations appeared to receive great corroboration; and on the firstimpulse, the populace had even run down in a disorderly manner toprevent them from disembarking."Book 24,Chapter 28,"While affairs were in this unsettled state, it was resolved tocall an assembly; in which, when some leaned to one side and some tothe other, and an insurrection being on the point of breaking out,Apollonides, one of the nobles, delivered a speech fraught withsalutary advice, considering the critical state of affairs: ""Never,""he said, ""had a state a nearer prospect of safety and annihilation.For if they would all unanimously espouse the cause either of theRomans or the Carthaginians, there could be no state whose conditionwould be more prosperous and happy; but if they pulled different ways,the war between the Romans and Carthaginians would not be more bloodythan that which would take place between the Syracusans themselves, inwhich both the contending parties would have their forces, theirtroops, and their generals, within the same walls. Every exertionought therefore to be made that all might think alike. Which alliancewould be productive of the greater advantages, was a question of quitea secondary nature, and of less moment; though the authority of Hieroought to be followed in preference to that of Hieronymus in theselection of allies, and a friendship of which they had had a happyexperience through a space of fifty years, ought to be chosen ratherthan one now untried and formerly unfaithful. That it ought also tohave some weight in their deliberations, that peace with theCarthaginians might be refused in such a manner as not immediately, atleast, to have a war with them, while with the Romans they mustforthwith have either peace or war."" The less of party spirit andwarmth appeared in this speech the greater weight it had. A militarycouncil also was united with the praetors and a chosen body ofsenators; the commanders of companies also, and the praefects of theallies, were ordered to consult conjointly. After the question hadbeen agitated with great warmth, at length, as there appeared to be nomeans of carrying on a war with the Romans, it was resolved that atreaty of peace should be formed, and that ambassadors should be sentwith those from Rome to ratify the same."Book 24,Chapter 29,"Not many days intervened before ambassadors came from theLeontines, requesting troops to protect their frontiers; an embassywhich appeared to afford a very favourable opportunity fordisencumbering the city of a turbulent and disorderly rabble, and forremoving their leaders to a distance. The praetor, Hippocrates, wasordered to lead the deserters thither. Many of the mercenaryauxiliaries accompanying them made them number four thousand armedmen. This expedition gave great delight both to those who were sentand those who sent them, for to the former an opportunity was affordedof change which they had long desired, while the latter were rejoicedbecause they considered that a kind of sink of the city had beendrained off. But they had, as it were, only relieved a sick body for atime, that it might afterwards fall into a more aggravated disease.For Hippocrates began to ravage the adjoining parts of the Romanprovince, at first by stealthy excursions, but afterwards, when Appieshad sent a body of troops to protect the lands of the allies, he madean attack with all his forces upon the guard posted over against him,and slew many. Marcellus, when informed of this, immediately sentambassadors to Syracuse, who said that the faith of the treaty hadbeen broken, and that there would never be wanting a cause forhostilities, unless Hippocrates and Epicydes were removed not onlyfrom Syracuse, but far from all Sicily. Epicydes, lest by beingpresent he should be arraigned for the offence committed by his absentbrother, or should be wanting on his own part in stirring up a war,proceeded himself also to the Leontines; and seeing that they werealready sufficiently exasperated against the Romans, he endeavoured todetach them from the Syracusans also. His argument was, that the termson which they had formed a treaty of peace with the Romans were, thatwhatever people had been subject to their kings should be placed undertheir dominion; and that now they were not satisfied with libertyunless they could also exercise kingly power and dominion over others.The answer, therefore, he said, which they ought to send back was,that the Leontines also considered themselves entitled to liberty,either on the ground that the tyrant fell in the streets of theircity, or that there the shout was first raised for liberty; and thatthey were the persons who, abandoning the king's generals, flocked toSyracuse. That, therefore, either that article must be expunged fromthe treaty, or that that term of it would not be admitted. They easilypersuaded the multitude; and when the ambassadors of Syracusecomplained of the slaughter of the Roman guard, and ordered thatHippocrates and Epicydes should depart either to Locri or any otherplace they pleased, provided they quitted Sicily, a reply was made tothem in a haughty manner, ""that they had neither placed themselves atthe disposal of the Syracusans to make a peace for them with theRomans, nor were they bound by the treaties of other people."" Thisanswer the Syracusans laid before the Romans, declaring at the sametime that ""the Leontines were not under their control, and that,therefore, the Romans might make war on them without violating thetreaty subsisting between them; that they would also not be wanting inthe war, provided that when brought again under subjection, theyshould form a part of their dominion, agreeably to the conditions ofthe peace."""Book 24,Chapter 30,"Marcellus marched with his entire forces against Leontini, havingsent for Appius also, in order that he might attack it in anotherquarter; when, such was the ardour of the troops in consequence of theindignation they felt at the Roman guards being put to the swordduring the negotiations for a peace, that they took the town by stormon the first assault. Hippocrates and Epicydes, perceiving that theenemy were getting possession of the walls and breaking open thegates, retired with a few others into the citadel, from which theyfled unobserved during the night to Herbessus. The Syracusans, who hadmarched from home with eight thousand troops, were met at the riverMyla by a messenger, who informed them that the city was taken. Therest which he stated was a mixture of truth and falsehood; he saidthat there had been an indiscriminate massacre of the soldiers and thetownsmen, and that he did not think that one person who had arrived atpuberty had survived; that the town had been pillaged, and theproperty of the rich men given to the troops. On receiving suchdireful news the army halted; and while all were under violentexcitement, the generals, Sosis and Dinomenes, consulted together asto the course to be taken. The scourging and beheading of two thousanddeserters had given to this false statement a plausibility whichexcited alarm; but no violence was offered to any of the Leontine orother soldiers after the city was taken; and every man's property wasrestored to him, with the exception only of such as was destroyed inthe first confusion which attended the capture of the city. Thetroops, who complained of their fellow-soldiers having been betrayedand butchered, could neither be induced to proceed to Leontini, norwait where they were for more certain intelligence. The praetors,perceiving their minds disposed to mutiny, but concluding that theirviolence would not be of long continuance, if those who had led themon to such folly were removed, led the troops to Megara, whence theythemselves with a few horsemen proceeded to Herbessus, under theexpectation of having the city betrayed to them in the generalconsternation; but being disappointed in this attempt, they resolvedto resort to force, and moved their camp from Megara on the followingday, in order to attack Herbessus with all their forces. Hippocratesand Epicydes having formed the design of putting themselves into thehands of the soldiers, who were for the most part accustomed to them,and were now incensed at the report of the massacre of their comrades,not so much as a safe measure on the first view of it as that it wastheir only course, now that all hope was cut off, went out to meet thearmy. It happened that the troops which marched in the van were sixhundred Cretans, who had been engaged in the service of Hieronymusunder their command, and were under obligation to Hannibal, havingbeen captured at the Trasimenus among the Roman auxiliaries, anddismissed by him. Hippocrates and Epicydes, recognising them by theirstandards and the fashion of their armour, held out olive branches,and the fillets usually worn by suppliants, and implored them toreceive them into their ranks, protect them when received, and notbetray them to the Syracusans, by whom they themselves would soon bedelivered up to the Romans to be butchered."Book 24,Chapter 31,"But the Cretans with one accord called out to them to be of goodcourage; that they would share every fortune with them. During thisconversation, the vanguard had halted, and the march was delayed; norhad the cause of the delay as yet reached the generals. After thereport had spread that Hippocrates and Epicydes were there, and avoice was heard through the whole army, which showed evidently thatthe troops were pleased at their arrival, the praetors immediatelygallopped to the front, and earnestly asked ""what was the meaning ofthat violation of discipline, which the Cretans had committed inholding conference with the enemy, and allowing them to mingle withtheir ranks without the authority of the praetors."" They orderedHippocrates to be seized and thrown into chains. On hearing which sucha clamour was raised, first by the Cretans and then by the rest, thatit was quite evident if they proceeded farther that they would havecause to fear. In this state of anxiety and perplexity, they gaveorders to march back to Megara, whence they had set out, and sentmessengers to Syracuse, to give information of their presentcondition. Hippocrates added a deception, seeing that the minds of thetroops were disposed to entertain every suspicion. Having sent someCretans to lie in wait in the roads, he read a letter he pretended hadbeen intercepted, but which he had written himself. The address was:""The praetors of Syracuse to the consul Marcellus."" After thecustomary wishing of health, it stated ""that he had acted duly andproperly in sparing none of the Leontines, but that the cause of allthe mercenary troops was the same, and that Syracuse would never betranquil while there were any foreign auxiliaries in the city or inthe army. That it was therefore necessary that he should endeavour toget into his power those who were encamped at Megara, with theirpraetors, and by punishing them, at length restore Syracuse toliberty."" After this letter had been read, they ran to seize theirarms in every direction, with so great a clamour, that the praetors,in the utmost consternation, rode away to Syracuse during theconfusion. The mutiny, however, was not quelled even by their flight,but an attack was made upon the Syracusan soldiers; nor would any onehave escaped their violence, had not Hippocrates and Epicydes opposedthe resentment of the multitude, not from pity or any humane motive,but lest they should cut off all hope of effecting their return; andthat they might have the soldiers, both as faithful supporters oftheir cause, and as hostages, and conciliate to themselves theirrelatives and friends, in the first place by so great an obligation,and in the next by reason of the pledge. Having also experienced thatthe populace could be excited by any cause, however groundless ortrifling, they procured a soldier of the number of those who werebesieged at Leontini, whom they suborned to carry a report toSyracuse, corresponding with that which had been falsely told at theMyla; and by vouching for what he stated, and relating as matterswhich he had seen, those things of which doubts were entertained, tokindle the resentment of the people."Book 24,Chapter 32,"This man not only obtained credit with the commons, but beingintroduced into the senate-house, produced an impression upon thesenate also. Some men of no small authority openly declared, that itwas very fortunate that the rapacity and cruelty of the Romans hadbeen made apparent in the case of the Leontines; that if they hadentered Syracuse, they would have committed the same or even morehorrible acts, as there the temptations to rapacity would have beengreater. All, therefore, advised that the gates should be closed andthe city guarded, but not the same persons were objects of fear orhatred to all alike. Among the soldiers of every kind, and a greatpart of the people, the Roman name was hated. The praetors, and a fewof the nobles, though enraged by the fictitious intelligence, ratherdirected their cautions against a nearer and more immediate evil.Hippocrates and Epicycles were now at the Hexapylum; and conversationswere taking place, fomented by the relatives of the native soldierswho were in the army, touching the opening of the gates, and theallowing their common country to be defended from the violence of theRomans. One of the doors of the Hexapylum was now thrown open, and thetroops began to be taken in at it, when the praetors interposed; andfirst by commands and menaces, then by advice, they endeavoured todeter them from their purpose, and last of all, every other meansproving ineffectual, forgetful of their dignity, they tried to movethem by prayers, imploring them not to betray their country to menheretofore the satellites of the tyrant, and now the corrupters of thearmy. But the ears of the excited multitude were deaf to all thesearguments, and the exertions made from within to break open the gates,were not less than those without; the gates were all broken open, andthe whole army received into the Hexapylum. The praetors, with theyouth of the city, fled into the Achradina; the mercenary soldiers anddeserters, with all the soldiers of the late king who were atSyracuse, joined the forces of the enemy. The Achradina also wastherefore taken on the first assault, and all the praetors, exceptsuch as escaped in the confusion, were put to the sword. Night put anend to the carnage. On the following day the slaves were invited toliberty, and those bound in prison were released; after which thismixed rabble created Hippocrates and Epicydes their praetors, and thusSyracuse, when for a brief period the light of liberty had shone onit, relapsed into her former state of servitude."Book 24,Chapter 33,"The Romans, on receiving information of these events, immediatelymoved their camp from Leontini to Syracuse. It happened at this timethat ambassadors were sent by Appius in a quinquereme, to make theirway through the harbour. A quadrireme was sent in advance, which wascaptured as soon as it entered the mouth of the harbour, and theambassadors with difficulty made their escape. And now not only thelaws of peace but of war also were not regarded, when the Roman armypitched their camp at Olympium, a temple of Jupiter, a mile and a halffrom the city. From which place also it was thought proper thatambassadors should be sent forward; these were met by Hippocrates andEpicydes with their friends without the gate, to prevent theirentering the city. The Roman, who was appointed to speak, said that""he did not bring war, but aid and assistance to the Syracusans, notonly to such as, escaping from the midst of the carnage, fled to theRomans for protection, but to those also, who, overpowered by fear,were submitting to a servitude more shocking, not only than exile, butthan death. Nor would the Romans suffer the horrid murder of theirfriends to go unavenged. If, therefore, those who had taken refugewith them were allowed to return to their country with safety, theauthors of the massacre delivered up, and the Syracusans reinstated inthe enjoyment of their liberty and laws, there would be no necessityfor arms; but if these things were not done, they would direct theirarms unceasingly against those who delayed them, whoever they mightbe."" Epicydes replied, that ""if they had been commissioned with anymessage for them, they would have given them an answer; and when thegovernment of Syracuse was in the hands of those persons to whom theywere come, they might visit Syracuse again. If they should commencehostilities, they would learn by actual experience that it was by nomeans the same thing to besiege Syracuse and Leontini."" With this heleft the ambassadors and closed the gate. The siege of Syracuse thencommenced by sea and land at the same time; by land on the side of theHexapylum; by sea on the side of the Achradina, the wall of which iswashed by its waves; and as the Romans felt a confidence that as theyhad taken Leontini by the terror they occasioned on the first assault,they should be able in some quarter to effect an entrance into a cityso desert, and diffused over so large an extent of ground, theybrought up to the walls every kind of engine for besieging cities."Book 24,Chapter 34,"And an attempt made with so much energy would have succeeded, hadit not been for one person then at Syracuse. That person wasArchimedes, a man of unrivalled skill in observing the heavens and thestars, but more deserving of admiration as the inventor andconstructor of warlike engines and works, by means of which, with avery slight effort, he turned to ridicule what the enemy effected withgreat difficulty. The wall which ran along unequal eminences, most ofwhich were high and difficult of access, some low and open to approachalong level vales, he furnished with every kind of warlike engine, asseemed suitable to each particular place. Marcellus attacked from thequinqueremes the wall of the Achradina, which, as before stated, waswashed by the sea. From the other ships the archers and slingers andlight infantry, whose weapon is difficult to be thrown back by theunskilful, allowed scarce any person to remain upon the wallunwounded. These, as they required room for the discharge of theirmissiles, kept their ships at a distance from the wall. Eight morequinqueremes joined together in pairs, the oars on their inner sidesbeing removed, so that side might be placed to side, and which formingas it were ships, were worked by means of the oars on the outer sides,carried turrets built up in stories, and other engines employed inbattering walls. Against this naval armament, Archimedes placed ondifferent parts of the walls engines of various dimensions. Againstthe ships which were at a distance he discharged stones of immenseweight. Those which were nearer he assailed with lighter, andtherefore more numerous missiles. Lastly, in order that his own menmight heap their weapons upon the enemy, without receiving any woundsthemselves, he perforated the wall from the top to the bottom with agreat number of loop-holes, about a cubit in diameter, through whichsome with arrows, others with scorpions of moderate size, assailed theenemy without being seen. Certain ships which came nearer to the wallsin order to get within the range of the engines, he placed upon theirsterns, raising up their prows by throwing upon them an iron grapple,attached to a strong chain, by means of a tolleno which projected fromthe wall, and overhung them, having a heavy counterpoise of lead whichforced back the lever to the ground; then the grapple being suddenlydisengaged, the ship falling as it were from the wall, was, by thesemeans, to the utter consternation of the mariners, dashed in such amanner against the water, that even if it fell back in an erectposition it took in a great quantity of water. Thus the attack by seawas foiled, and their whole efforts were directed to an attack by landwith all their forces. But on this side also the place was furnishedwith a similar array of engines of every kind, procured at the expenseof Hiero, who had given his attention to this object through a courseof many years, and constructed by the unrivalled abilities ofArchimedes. The nature of the place also assisted them; for the rockwhich formed the foundation of the wall was for the most part sosteep, that not only materials discharged from engines, but such aswere rolled down by their own gravity, fell upon the enemy with greatforce; the same cause rendered the approach to the city difficult, andthe footing unsteady. Wherefore, a council being held, it wasresolved, since every attempt was frustrated, to abstain fromassaulting the place, and keeping up a blockade, only to cut off theprovisions of the enemy by sea and land."Book 24,Chapter 35,"Meanwhile, Marcellus, who had set out with about a third part ofthe army, to recover the towns which, during the commotion, had goneover to the Carthaginians, regained Helorus and Herbessus by voluntarysurrender. Megara, which he took by storm, he demolished andplundered, in order to terrify the rest, but particularly theSyracusans. Much about the same time, Himilco, who had kept his fleetfor a long time at the promontory of Pachynus, landed twenty-fivethousand infantry, three thousand horse, and twelve elephants, atHeraclea, which they call Minoa. This force was much greater than thatwhich he had before on board his fleet at Pachynus. But after Syracusewas seized by Hippocrates, he proceeded to Carthage, where, beingaided by ambassadors from Hippocrates, and a letter from Hannibal, whosaid that now was the time to recover Sicily with the highest honour,while his own advice given in person had no small influence, he hadprevailed upon the Carthaginians to transport into Sicily as large aforce as possible, both of foot and horse. Immediately on his arrivalhe retook Heraclea, and within a few days after Agrigentum; and in theother states which sided with the Carthaginians, such confident hopeswere kindled of driving the Romans out of Sicily, that at last eventhose who were besieged at Syracuse took courage; and thinking thathalf their forces would be sufficient for the defence of the city,they divided the business of the war between them in such a manner,that Epicydes superintended the defence of the city, whileHippocrates, in conjunction with Himilco, prosecuted the war againstthe Roman consul. The latter, having passed by night through theintervals between the posts, with ten thousand foot and five hundredhorse, was pitching a camp near the city Acrillae, when Marcellus cameupon them, while engaged in raising the fortifications, on his returnfrom Agrigentum, which was already occupied by the enemy, havingfailed in his attempt to get there before the enemy by expeditiousmarching, Marcellus calculated upon any thing rather than meeting witha Syracusan army at that time and place; but still through fear ofHimilco and the Carthaginians, for whom he was by no means a matchwith the forces he had with him, he was marching with all possiblecircumspection, and with his troops so arranged, as to be prepared forany thing which might occur."Book 24,Chapter 36,"It happened that the caution he had observed with intent to guardhim against the Carthaginians, proved useful against the Sicilians.Having caught them in disorder and dispersed, employed in formingtheir camp, and for the most part unarmed, he cut off all theirinfantry. Their cavalry, having commenced a slight engagement, fled toAcrae with Hippocrates. This battle having checked the Sicilians intheir purpose of revolting from the Romans, Marcellus returned toSyracuse, and a few days after Himilco, being joined by Hippocrates,encamped on the river Anapus, about eight miles distant from thatplace. Nearly about the same time, fifty-five ships of war of theCarthaginians, with Bomilcar as commander of the fleet, put into thegreat harbour of Syracuse from the sea, and a Roman fleet of thirtyquinqueremes landed the first legion at Panormus; and so intent wereboth the contending powers upon Sicily, that the seat of war mightseem to have been removed from Italy. Himilco, who thought that theRoman legion which had been landed at Panormus, would doubtless fall aprey to him on its way to Syracuse, was mistaken in his road; for theCarthaginian marched through the inland parts of the country, whilethe legion, keeping along the coast, and attended by the fleet, cameup with Appius Claudius, who had advanced to Pachynum with a part ofhis forces to meet it. Nor did the Carthaginians delay longer atSyracuse. Bomilcar, who at the same time that he did not feelsufficient confidence in his naval strength, as the Romans had a fleetmore than double his number, was aware that delay which could beattended with no good effect, would only increase the scarcity ofprovisions among the allies by the presence of his troops, sailed outinto the deep, and crossed over into Africa. Himilco, who had in vainfollowed Marcellus to Syracuse, to see if he could get any opportunityof engaging him before he was joined by larger forces, failing in thisobject, and seeing that the enemy were secured at Syracuse, both bytheir fortifications and the strength of their forces, to avoidwasting time in sitting by as an idle spectator of the siege of hisallies, without being able to do any good, marched his troops away, inorder to bring them up wherever the prospect of revolt from the Romansmight invite him, and wherever by his presence he might inspireadditional courage in those who espoused his interest. He first gotpossession of Murgantia, the Roman garrison having been betrayed bythe inhabitants themselves. Here a great quantity of corn andprovisions of every kind had been laid up by the Romans."Book 24,Chapter 37,"To this revolt the minds of other states also were stimulated; andthe Roman garrisons were now either driven out of the citadels, ortreacherously given up and overpowered. Enna, which stood on aneminence lofty and of difficult ascent on all sides, was impregnableon account of its situation, and had besides in its citadel a stronggarrison commanded by one who was very unlikely to be overreached bytreachery, Lucius Pinarius, a man of vigorous mind, who relied more onthe measures he took to prevent treachery, than on the fidelity of theSicilians; and at that time particularly the intelligence he hadreceived of so many cities being betrayed, and revolting, and of themassacre of the garrisons, had made him solicitous to use everyprecaution. Accordingly, by day and night equally, every thing waskept in readiness, and every place furnished with guards and watches,the soldiery being continually under arms and at their posts. But whenthe principal men in Enna, who had already entered into a covenantwith Himilco to betray the garrison, found that they could get noopportunity of circumventing the Roman, they resolved to act openly.They urged, that ""the city and the citadel ought to be under theircontrol, as they had formed an alliance with the Romans on theunderstanding that they were to be free, and had not been deliveredinto their custody as slaves. That they therefore thought it just thatthe keys of the gates should be restored to them. That their honourformed the strongest tie upon good allies, and that the people andsenate of Rome would entertain feelings of gratitude towards them ifthey continued in friendship with them of their own free will, and notby compulsion."" The Roman replied, that ""he was placed there by hisgeneral to protect the place; that from him he had received the keysof the gates and the custody of the citadel, trusts which he held notsubject to his own will, nor that of the inhabitants of Enna, but tohis who committed them to him. That among the Romans, for a man toquit his post was a capital offence, and that parents had sanctionedthat law by the death even of their own children. That the consulMarcellus was not far off; that they might send ambassadors to him,who possessed the right and liberty of deciding."" But they said, theywould certainly not send to him, and solemnly declared, that as theycould not obtain their object by argument, they would seek some meansof asserting their liberty. Pinarius upon this observed, ""that if theythought it too much to send to the consul, still they would, at least,grant him an assembly of the people, that it might be ascertainedwhether these denunciations came from a few, or from the whole state.""An assembly of the people was proclaimed for the next day, with thegeneral consent."Book 24,Chapter 38,"After this conference, he returned into the citadel, andassembling his soldiers, thus addressed them: ""Soldiers, I suppose youhave heard in what manner the Roman garrisons have been betrayed andcut off by the Sicilians of late. You have escaped the same treachery,first by the kindness of the gods, and secondly by your own goodconduct, in unremittingly standing and watching under arms. I wish therest of our time may be passed without suffering or committingdreadful things. This caution, which we have hitherto employed, hasbeen directed against covert treachery, but not succeeding in this asthey wished, they now publicly and openly demand back the keys of thegates; but as soon as we shall have delivered them up, Enna will beinstantly in the hands of the Carthaginians, and we shall be butcheredunder circumstances more horrid than those with which the garrison ofMurgantia were massacred. I have with difficulty procured a delay ofone night for deliberation, that I might employ it in acquainting youwith the danger which threatens you. At daybreak they intend holding ageneral assembly for the purpose of criminating me, and stirring upthe people against you; to-morrow, therefore, Enna will be inundatedeither with your blood, or that of its own inhabitants. If they arebeforehand with you, you will have no hope left, but if you anticipatetheir proceedings, you will have no danger. Victory will belong tothat side which shall have drawn the sword first. You shall all,therefore, full armed, attentively wait the signal. I shall be in theassembly, and by talking and disputing will spin out the time tillevery thing shall be ready. When I shall have given the signal with mygown, then, mind me raising a shout on all sides rush upon themultitude, and fell all before you with the sword, taking care that noone survive from whom either force or fraud can be apprehended. You,mother Ceres and Proserpine, I entreat, and all ye other gods,celestial and infernal, who frequent this city and these consecratedlakes and groves, that you would lend us your friendly and propitiousaid, as we adopt this measure not for the purpose of inflicting, butaverting injury. I should exhort you at greater length my soldiers, ifyou were about to fight with armed men, men unarmed and off theirguard, you will slay to satiety. The consul's camp too is near, sothat nothing can be apprehended from Himilco and the Carthaginians'."""Book 24,Chapter 39,"Being allowed to retire immediately after this exhortation, theyemployed themselves in taking refreshment. The next day they stationedthemselves some in one place and others in another, to block up thestreets, and shut up the ways by which the townsmen might escape, thegreater part of them stationing themselves upon and round the theatre,as they had been accustomed before also to be spectators of theassemblies. When the Roman praefect, having been brought into thepresence of the people by the magistrates, said, that the power andauthority of deciding the question appertained to the consul, and notto him, repeating for the most part what he had urged the day before,first of all a small number, and then more, desired him to give up thekeys, but afterwards all with one consent demanded it, and when hehesitated and delayed, threatened him furiously, and seemed as thoughthey would not further delay violent extremities then the praefectgave the signal agreed upon with his gown and the soldiers, who hadbeen long anxiously waiting the signal, and in readiness, raising ashout, ran down, some of them from the higher ground, upon the rear ofthe assembly while others blocked up the passages leading out of thecrowded theatre. The people of Enna thus shut up in the pit were putto the sword, being heaped one upon another not only in consequence ofthe slaughter, but also from their own efforts to escape, for somescrambling over the heads of others, and those that were unhurtfalling upon the wounded, and the living upon the dead, they wereaccumulated together. Thence they ran in every direction throughoutthe city, when nothing was any where to be seen but flight andbloodshed, as though the city had been captured, for the rage of thesoldiery was not less excited in putting to the sword an unarmedrabble, than it would have been had the heat of battle and an equalityof danger stimulated it. Thus possession of Enna was retained, by anact which was either atrocious or unavoidable. Marcellus did notdisapprove of the deed, and gave up the plunder of the place to thesoldiery, concluding that the Sicilians, deterred by this example,would refrain from betraying their garrisons. As this city wassituated in the heart of Sicily, and was distinguished both on accountof the remarkable strength of its natural situation, and because everypart of it was rendered sacred by the traces it contained of the rapeof Proserpine of old, the news of its disaster spread though the wholeof Sicily in nearly one day, and as people considered that by thishorrid massacre violence had been done not only to the habitations ofmen, but even of the gods, then indeed those who even before thisevent were in doubt which side they should take, revolted to theCarthaginians Hippocrates and Himilco, who had in vain brought uptheir troops to Enna at the invitation of the traitors, retiredthence, the former to Murgantia, the latter to Agrigentum. Marcellusretrograded into the territory of Leontium, and after collecting aquantity of corn and other provisions in his camp there, left a smallbody of troops to protect it, and then went to carry on the siege ofSyracuse. Appius Claudius having been allowed to go from thence toRome to put up for the consulship, he appointed Titus QuintusCrispinus to command the fleet and the old camp in his room. Hehimself fortified his camp, and built huts for his troops at adistance of five miles from Hexapylum, at a place called Leon. Thesewere the transactions in Sicily up to the beginning of the winter."Book 24,Chapter 40,"The same summer the war with king Philip, as had been beforesuspected, broke out. Ambassadors from Oricum came to Marcus Valerius,the praetor, who was directing his fleet around Brundusium and theneighbouring coasts of Calabria, with intelligence, that Philip hadfirst made an attempt upon Apollonia, having approached it by sailingup the river with a hundred and twenty barks with two banks of oars;after that, not succeeding so speedily as he had hoped, that he hadbrought up his army secretly to Oricum by night; which city, as it wassituated on a plain, and was not secured either by fortifications orby men and arms, was overpowered at the first assault. At the sametime that they delivered this intelligence, they entreated him tobring them succour, and repel that decided enemy of the Romans by landor by a naval force, since they were attacked for no other cause thanthat they lay over against Italy. Marcus Valerius, leaving PubliusValerius lieutenant-general charged with the protection of thatquarter, set sail with his fleet equipped and prepared, having put onboard of ships of burthen such soldiers as there was not room for inthe men of war, and reached Oricum on the second day; and as that citywas occupied by a slight garrison, which Philip had left on hisdeparture thence, he retook it without much opposition. Hereambassadors came to him from Apollonia, stating that they weresubjected to a siege because they were unwilling to revolt from theRomans, and that they would not be able any longer to resist the powerof the Macedonians, unless a Roman force were sent for theirprotection. Having undertaken to perform what they wished, he sent twothousand chosen armed men in ships of war to the mouth of the river,under the command of Quintus Naevius Crista, praefect of the allies, aman of enterprise, and experienced in military affairs. Having landedhis troops, and sent back the ships to join the rest of the fleet atOricum, whence he had come, he marched his troops at a distance fromthe river, by a way not guarded at all by the king's party, andentered the city by night, so that none of the enemy perceived him.During the following day they remained quiet, to afford time for thepraefect to inspect the youth of Apollonia, together with the arms andresources of the city. Having derived considerable confidence from areview and inspection of these, and at the same time discovering fromscouts the supineness and negligence which prevailed among the enemy,he marched out of the city during the dead of night without any noise,and entered the camp of the enemy, which was in such a neglected andexposed state, that it was quite clear that a thousand men had passedthe rampart before any one perceived them, and that had they abstainedfrom putting them to the sword, they might have penetrated to theroyal pavilion. The killing of those who were nearest the gate arousedthe enemy; and in consequence, they were all seized with such alarmand dismay, that not only none of the rest attempted to take arms orendeavour to expel the enemy from the camp, but even the king himself,betaking himself to flight, in a manner half naked and just as he waswhen roused from his sleep, hurried away to the river and his ships ina garb scarcely decent for a private soldier, much less for a king.Thither also the rest of the multitude fled with the utmostprecipitation. Little less than three thousand men were slain or madeprisoners in the camp; considerably more, however, were captured thanslain. The camp having been plundered, the Apollonians removed intotheir city the catapults, ballistas, and other engines which had beengot together for the purpose of assaulting their city, for theprotection of their walls, in case at any time a similar conjunctureshould arise; all the rest of the plunder which the camp afforded wasgiven up to the Romans. Intelligence of these events having beencarried to Oricum, Marcus Valerius immediately brought his fleet tothe mouth of the river, that the king might not attempt to make hisescape by ship. Thus Philip, having lost all hope of being able tocope with his enemies by land or sea, and having either hauled onshore or burnt his ships, made for Macedonia by land, his troops beingfor the most part unarmed and despoiled of their baggage. The Romanfleet, with Marcus Valerius, wintered at Oricum."Book 24,Chapter 41,"The same year the war was prosecuted in Spain with varioussuccess; for before the Romans crossed the Iberus, Mago and Hasdrubalhad routed an immense army of Spaniards; and the farther Spain wouldhave revolted from the Romans, had not Publius Cornelius, hastilycrossing the Iberus with his army, given a seasonable stimulus to thewavering resolutions of his allies by his arrival among them. TheRomans first encamped at a place called the High Camp, which isremarkable for the death of the great Hamilcar. It was a fortressstrongly defended by works, and thither they had previously conveyedcorn; but as the whole circumjacent country was full of enemy'stroops, and the Roman army on its march had been charged by thecavalry of the enemy without being able to take revenge upon them, twothousand men, who either loitered behind or had strayed through thefields, having been slain, the Romans quitted this place to get nearerto a friendly country, and fortified a camp at the mount of Victory.To this place came Cneius Scipio with all his forces, and Hasdrubal,son of Gisgo, and a third Carthaginian general, with a complete army,all of whom took up a position opposite the Roman camp and on theother side the river. Publius Scipio, going out with some light troopsto take a view of the surrounding country, was observed by the enemy;and he would have been overpowered in the open plain, had he notseized an eminence near him. Here too he was closely invested, but wasrescued from the troops which environed him by the arrival of hisbrother. Castulo, a city of Spain, so strong and celebrated, and soclosely connected with the Carthaginians, that Hannibal had taken awife from it, revolted to the Romans. The Carthaginians commenced thesiege of Illiturgi, because there was a Roman garrison in it; and itseemed that they would carry the place, chiefly in consequence of alack of provisions. Cneius Scipio, setting out with a legion lightlyequipped, in order to bring succour to his allies and the garrison,entered the city, passing between the two camps of the enemy, andslaying a great number of them. The next day also he sallied out andfought with equal success. Above twelve thousand were slain in the twobattles, more than a thousand made prisoners, and thirty-six militarystandards captured. In consequence of this they retired fromIlliturgi. After this the siege of Bigerra, a city which was also inalliance with the Romans, was commenced by the Carthaginians; butScipio coming up, raised the siege without experiencing anyopposition."Book 24,Chapter 42,"The Carthaginians then removed their camp to Munda, whither theRomans speedily followed them. Here a pitched battle was fought, whichlasted almost four hours; and while the Romans were carrying allbefore them in the most glorious manner, the signal for retreat wassounded, because the thigh of Cneius Scipio had been transfixed with ajavelin. The soldiers round about him were thrown into a state ofgreat alarm, lest the wound should be mortal. However, there was nodoubt but that if they had not been prevented by the intervention ofthis accident, they might have taken the Carthaginian camp that day.By this time, not only the men, but the elephants, were driven quiteup to the rampart; and even upon the top of it nine and thirtyelephants were pierced with spears. In this battle, too, as many astwelve thousand are said to have been slain, nearly three thousandcaptured, with fifty-seven military standards. The Carthaginiansretired thence to the city Auringis, whither the Romans followed them,in order to take advantage of their terror. Here Scipio again foughtthem, having been carried into the field in a small litter; thevictory was decisive; but not half so many of the enemy were slain asbefore, because fewer survived to fight. But this family, whichpossessed a natural talent at renewing war and restoring its effects,in a short time recruited their army, Mago having been sent by hisbrother to press soldiers, and assumed courage to try the issue of afresh struggle. Though the soldiers were for the most part different,yet as they fought in a cause which had so often been unsuccessfulwithin the space of a few days, they carried into the field the samestate of mind as those which had been engaged before, and the issue ofthe battle was similar. More than eight thousand were slain, not muchless than a thousand captured, with fifty-eight military standards.The greater part of the spoils had belonged to the Gauls, consistingof golden chains and bracelets in great numbers. Also twodistinguished Gallic petty princes, whose names were Moenicaptus andCivismarus, fell in this battle. Eight elephants were captured andthree slain. When affairs went on so prosperously in Spain, the Romansbegan to feel ashamed that Saguntum, on account of which the war hadoriginated, should continue for now the eighth year in the power ofthe enemy. Accordingly, having expelled by force the Carthaginiangarrison, they retook that town, and restored it to such of theancient inhabitants as had survived the fury of the war. TheTurditanians also, who had been the cause of the war between thatpeople and the Carthaginians, they reduced under their power, soldthem as slaves, and razed their city."Book 24,Chapter 43,"Such were the achievements in Spain during the consulate ofQuintus Fabius and Marcus Claudius. At Rome, as soon as the newplebeian tribunes entered upon their office, Lucius Metellus, aplebeian tribune, immediately appointed a day for impleading thecensors, Publius Furius and Marcus Atilius, before the people. In thepreceding year, when he was quaestor, they had deprived him of hishorse, removed him from his tribe, and disfranchised him, on accountof the conspiracy entered into at Cannae to abandon Italy. But beingaided by the other nine tribunes, they were forbidden to answer whilein office, and were discharged. The death of Publius Furius preventedtheir completing the lustrum. Marcus Atilius abdicated his office. Anassembly for the election of consuls was held by Quintus FabiusMaximus. The consuls elected were Quintus Fabius Maximus, son of theconsul, and Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus a second time, both beingabsent. The praetors appointed were Marcus Atilius, and the two curuleaediles, Publius Sempronius Tuditanus and Cneius Fulvius Centumalus,together with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. It is recorded, that the scenicgames were this year, for the first time, celebrated for four days bythe curule aediles. The aedile Tuditanus was the man who made his waythrough the midst of the enemy at Cannae when all the rest wereparalysed with fear, in consequence of that dreadful calamity. As soonas the elections were completed, the consuls elect having beensummoned to Rome, at the instance of Quintus Fabius, the consul,entered upon their office, and took the sense of the senate respectingthe war, their own provinces as well as those of the praetors, andalso respecting the armies to be employed, and which each of them wasto command."Book 24,Chapter 44,"The provinces and armies were thus distributed: the prosecution ofthe war with Hannibal was given to the consuls, and of the armies, onewhich Sempronius himself had commanded, and another which the consulFabius had commanded, each consisting of two legions. Marcus Aemilius,the praetor, who had the foreign jurisdiction, was to have Luceria ashis province, with the two legions which Quintus Fabius, then consul,had commanded as praetor, his colleague, Marcus Atilius, the citypraetor, undertaking the duties of his office. The province ofAriminum fell to the lot of Publius Sempronius, that of Suessula toCneius Fulvius, with two legions each likewise; Fulvius taking withhim the city legions; Tuditanus receiving his from Manius Pomponius.The following generals were continued in command, and their provincesassigned to them thus: to Marcus Claudius, so much of Sicily as laywithin the limits of the kingdom of Hiero; to Lentulus, thepropraetor, the old province in that island; to Titus Otacilius, thefleet; no additional troops were assigned to them. Marcus Valerius hadGreece and Macedonia, with the legion and the fleet which he hadthere; Quintus Mucius had Sardinia, with his old army, consisting oftwo legions; Caius Terentius, Picenum, with one legion which he thencommanded. Besides, orders were given to enlist two legions for thecity, and twenty thousand men from the allies. With these leaders andthese forces did they fortify the Roman empire against the many warswhich had either actually broken out, or were suspected at one and thesame time. After enlisting the city legions and raising troops to makeup the numbers of the others, the consuls, before they quitted thecity, expiated the prodigies which were reported. A wall and a gatehad been struck by lightning; and at Aricia even the temple of Jupiterhad been struck by lightning. Other illusions of the eyes and earswere credited as realities. An appearance as of ships had been seen inthe river at Tarracina, when there were none there. A clashing of armswas heard in the temple of Jupiter Vicilinus, in the territory ofCompsa; and a river at Amiternum had flowed bloody. These prodigieshaving been expiated according to a decree of the pontiffs, theconsuls set out, Sempronius for Lucania, Fabius for Apulia. The fatherof the latter came into the camp at Suessula, as hislieutenant-general; and when the son advanced to meet him, thelictors, out of respect for his dignity, went on in silence. The oldman rode past eleven of the fasces, when the consul ordered the lictornearest to him to take care and he called to him to dismount; then atlength dismounting, he exclaimed, ""I wished to try, my son, whetheryou were duly sensible that you are a consul."""Book 24,Chapter 45,"To this camp came Dasias Altinius of Arpi privately and by night,attended by three slaves, with a promise that if he should receive areward for it, he would engage to betray Arpi to them. Fabius havinglaid the matter before a council, some were of opinion that ""he oughtto be scourged and put to death as a deserter, as a man of unstablemind, and a common enemy to both sides; who, after the defeat atCannae, had gone over to Hannibal and drawn Arpi into revolt, as if itwere right that a man's fidelity should vary according to thefluctuations of fortune; and who now, when the Roman cause, contraryto his hopes and wishes, was as it were rising up again, would seem toaggravate his baseness by recompensing those whom he had formerlybetrayed, by fresh betrayal. That a man whose custom it was to espouseone side, while his heart was on another, was unworthy of confidenceas an ally, and contemptible as an enemy; that he ought to be made athird example to deserters, in addition to the betrayers of Faleriiand Pyrrhus."" On the other hand, Fabius, the father of the consul,observed, that, ""forgetful of circumstances, men were apt to exercisea free judgment on every question in the heat of war, as in time ofpeace; for though in the present instance that which ought rather toform the object of their endeavours and to occupy their thoughts, isby what means it may be brought about that none of the allies mayrevolt from the Roman people, yet that they never think of; but, onthe contrary, they urge that an example ought to be made of any whomight repent and look back upon their former alliance. But if it isallowable to forsake the Romans, and not allowable to return to them,who can doubt but that in a short time the Romans, deserted by theirallies, will see every state in Italy united in leagues with theCarthaginians. Not, however, that he was of opinion that anyconfidence was to be reposed in Altinius, but he would invent somemiddle course of proceeding. Treating him neither as an enemy nor as afriend for the present, his wish was, that he should be kept duringthe war in some city whose fidelity could be relied on, at a shortdistance from the camp, in a state of easy restraint; and that whenthe war was concluded, they should then deliberate whether he moredeserved to be punished for his former defection, or pardoned for hispresent return."" The opinion of Fabius was approved of. Altinius wasbound in chains and given into custody, together with his companions,and a large quantity of gold which he brought with him was ordered tobe kept for him. He was kept at Cales, where, during the day, he wasunconfined, but attended by guards who locked him up at night. He wasfirst missed and inquired for at his house at Arpi. but afterwards,when the report of his absence had spread through the city, a violentsensation was excited, as if they had lost their leader, and, from theapprehension of some attempt to alter the present state of things,messengers were immediately despatched to Hannibal. With this theCarthaginian was far from being displeased, both because he had longregarded the man himself with suspicion, as one of doubtful fidelity,and because he had now been lucky enough to get a pretext forpossessing himself of the property of so wealthy a person. But thatthe world might suppose that he had yielded to resentment more than toavarice, he added cruelty to rapacity; for he summoned his wife andchildren to the camp, and after having made inquiry, first, respectingthe flight of Altinius, and then, touching the quantity of gold andsilver which was left at his house, and informed himself on all thesepoints, he burned them alive."Book 24,Chapter 46,"Fabius, setting out from Suessula, first set about the siege ofArpi; and having pitched his camp about half a mile from it, he took anear view of the site and walls of the city, and resolved to attackit, in preference, in that quarter where it was most secured by works,and where the least care was taken in guarding it. After getting allthings together which could be of use in besieging a city, he selectedthe most efficient of the centurions out of the whole army, placingthem under the command of tribunes of approved valour, and giving themsix hundred soldiers, a number which was thought sufficient for thepurpose. These he ordered to bring the scaling ladders to the placewhich he had marked out, as soon as the signal of the fourth watch hadsounded. In this part there was a low and narrow gate, opening into astreet which was little frequented, and which led through a desertedpart of the city. He ordered them, after scaling the wall, to proceedto this gate, and break down the bars on the inside by force, and whenthey were in possession of that part of the city, to give a signalwith a cornet, that the rest of the troops might be brought up,observing that he would have every thing prepared and ready. Theseorders were executed promptly, and that which seemed likely to impedetheir operations, served more than any thing to conceal them. A showerof rain, which came on suddenly at midnight, compelled the guards andwatches to slip away from their posts and take shelter in the houses;and the noise of the shower, which was somewhat copious, at firstprevented their hearing that which was made by the men in breakingopen the gate. Afterwards, when it fell upon the ear more gently anduniformly, it lulled a great number of the men to sleep. After theyhad secured possession of the gate, they placed cornet-players in thestreet at equal distances, and desired them to sound, in order to callthe consul. This being done according to the plan previously agreedupon, the consul ordered the troops to march, and a little beforedaylight entered the city through the broken gate."Book 24,Chapter 47,"Then at length the enemy were roused, the shower was nowsubsiding, and daylight coming on. Hannibal had a garrison of aboutfive thousand armed men in the city, and the inhabitants themselveshad three thousand men in arms; these the Carthaginians placed infront against the enemy, to guard against any treachery on their rear.The fight was carried on at first in the dark, and in the narrowstreets, the Romans having seized not only the streets, but the housesalso nearest the gate, that they might not be struck or wounded by anything discharged at them from above. Some of the Arpinians and Romansrecognised each other, which led to conversations, in which the Romansasked them, what it was they meant? for what offence on the part ofthe Romans, or what service on that of the Carthaginians, they, whowere Italians, made war in favour of foreigners and barbarians,against their ancient allies the Romans, and endeavoured to renderItaly tributary and stipendiary to Africa? The Arpinians urged inexcuse of themselves, that in ignorance of all the circumstances, theyhad been sold to the Carthaginians by their nobility, and that theywere kept in a state of thraldom and oppression by the few. Abeginning having been made, greater numbers on both sides entered intoconversation; and at length the praetor of Arpi was brought by hiscountrymen before the consul, and after exchanging assurances in themidst of the standards and the troops, the Arpinians suddenly turnedtheir arms against the Carthaginians, in favour of the Romans. SomeSpaniards also, little less than a thousand in number, after onlystipulating with the consul that the Carthaginian garrison might beallowed to march out unhurt, passed over to the consul. The gates weretherefore thrown open for the Carthaginians; and being allowed to goout unmolested, in conformity with the stipulation, they joinedHannibal in Salapia. Thus was Arpi restored to the Romans, without theloss of a life, except that of one man, who was formerly a traitor,and recently a deserter. The Spaniards were ordered to receive adouble allowance of provisions, and on very many occasions therepublic availed itself of their brave and faithful services. Whileone of the consuls was in Apulia, and the other in Lucania, a hundredand twelve Campanian noblemen, having gone out of Capua, with thepermission of the magistrates, under pretence of collecting booty fromthe enemy's lands, came into the Roman camp, which lay above Suessula.They told the soldiers, forming the vanguard, that they wished tospeak with the praetor. Cneius Fulvius commanded the camp; who, onbeing informed of the circumstance, ordered ten of them to be broughtinto his presence unarmed; and after hearing their request, (and allthey asked was, that when the Romans should recover Capua, theirproperty might be restored to them,) they were all received under hisprotection. The other praetor, Sempronius Tuditanus, took by force thetown of Aternum; more than seven thousand were captured, with aconsiderable quantity of coined brass and silver. A dreadful firehappened at Rome, which continued for two nights and a day; everything was burnt to the ground between the Salinae and the Carmentalgate, with the Aequimaelium and the Jugarian street. In the temples ofFortune, Mater Matuta, and Hope, which latter stood without the gate,the fire, spreading to a wide extent, consumed much both sacred andprofane."Book 24,Chapter 48,"The same year, the two Cornelii, Publius and Cneius, as affairswere now in a prosperous state in Spain, and they had recovered manyancient allies, and attached fresh ones to them, extended their viewseven to Africa. Syphax was a king of the Numidians, who had suddenlybecome hostile to the Carthaginians; to him they sent three centurionsas ambassadors, to form a treaty of friendship and alliance with him;and to promise, that, if he persevered in pressing the war against theCarthaginians, he would render an acceptable service to the senate andpeople of Rome, and they would endeavour to requite the favour withlarge additions, and at a seasonable time. This embassy was gratifyingto the barbarian; and when conversing with the ambassadors on the artof war he heard the observations of those experienced soldiers, bycomparing his own practice with so regular a system of discipline, hebecame sensible of how many things he himself was ignorant. Then heentreated them to give the first proof of their being good andfaithful allies, ""by letting two of them carry back the result oftheir embassy to their generals, while one remained with him as hisinstructor in military science, observing that the Numidian nationwere unacquainted with the method of carrying on war with foot forces,being useful only as mounted soldiers. That it was in this manner thattheir ancestors had carried on war even from the first origin of theirnation, and to this they were habituated from their childhood. Butthat they had to contend with an enemy who relied upon the prowess oftheir infantry; with whom, if they wished to be placed upon anequality in respect of efficient strength, they must also furnishthemselves with infantry. That his dominions abounded with a largequantity of men fit for the purpose, but that he was unacquainted withthe art of arming, equipping, and marshalling them; that all hisinfantry were unwieldy and unmanageable, like a rabble collectedtogether by chance."" The ambassadors answered, that they would complywith his request for the present, on his engaging to send him backimmediately, if their generals did not approve of what they had done.The name of the person who staid behind with the king was QuintusStatorius. With the two other Romans, the Numidian sent ambassadorsinto Spain, to receive the ratification of the alliance from the Romangenerals. He gave it in charge to the same persons, forthwith toinduce the Numidians, who were serving as auxiliaries among theCarthaginian troops, to go over to the other side. Statorius raised abody of infantry for the king out of the large number of young menwhich he found; and having formed them into companies, in closeimitation of the Roman method, taught them to follow their standardsand keep their ranks when being marshalled, and when performing theirevolutions; and he so habituated them to military works and othermilitary duties, that in a short time the king relied not more on hiscavalry than on his infantry; and in a regular and pitched battle,fought on a level plain, he overcame his enemies, the Carthaginians.In Spain also the arrival of the king's ambassadors was of thegreatest advantage to the Romans, for at the news thereof theNumidians began rapidly to pass over. Thus the Romans and Syphax wereunited in friendship, which the Carthaginians hearing of, immediatelysent ambassadors to Gala, who reigned in another part of Numidia, overa nation called Massylians."Book 24,Chapter 49,"Gala had a son named Masinissa, seventeen years of age, but ayouth of such talents, that even at that time it was evident that hewould render the kingdom more extensive and powerful than when hereceived it. The ambassadors represented that, ""since Syphax hadunited himself with the Romans, that by their alliance he mightstrengthen his hands against the kings and nations of Africa, it wouldbe better for Gala also to unite with the Carthaginians as soon aspossible, before Syphax crossed over into Spain, or the Romans intoAfrica; that Syphax might be overpowered, while as yet he derivednothing from his league with the Romans but the name of it."" Gala, hisson claiming to be intrusted with the conduct of the war, was easilyprevailed upon to send an army, which, joined by the legions of theCarthaginians, totally defeated Syphax in a great battle. In thisthirty thousand men are said to have been slain. Syphax, with a fewhorsemen, fled from the field, and took refuge among the MaurusianNumidians, a nation dwelling at the extremity of Africa, near theocean, and over against Gades. But the barbarians flocking to hisstandard from all sides, in consequence of his great renown, hespeedily armed a very large force. Before he passed over with theseforces into Spain, which was separated only by a narrow strait,Masinissa came up with his victorious army; and here he acquired greatglory in the prosecution of the war with Syphax, in which he actedalone and unsupported by any aid from the Carthaginians. In Spainnothing worth mentioning was performed, except that the Romans drewover to their side the Celtiberian youth, by giving them the same paywhich they had stipulated with the Carthaginians to pay them. Theyalso sent above three hundred Spaniards of the greatest distinctioninto Italy, to bring over their countrymen, who served among theauxiliary troops of Hannibal. The only memorable circumstance of thisyear in Spain was, that the Romans then, for the first time, employedmercenary troops in their camp, namely, the Celtiberians."Book 25,Chapter 1,"Hannibal passed the summer during which these events occurred inAfrica and Italy, in the Tarentine territory, with the hope of havingthe city of the Tarentines betrayed to him. Meanwhile someinconsiderable towns belonging to them, and to the Sallentines,revolted to him. At the same time, of the twelve states of theBruttians, which had in a former year gone over to the Carthaginians,the Consentians and Thurians returned to the protection of the Romanpeople. And more would have done the same, had not Titus PomponiusVeientanus, praefect of the allies, having acquired the appearance ofa regular general, in consequence of several successful predatoryexpeditions in the Bruttian territory, got together a tumultuary band,and fought a battle with Hanno. In that battle, a great number of men,consisting, however, of a disorderly rabble of slaves and rustics,were slain or captured. The least part of the loss was, that thepraefect himself was taken prisoner; for he was not only in thepresent instance guilty of having rashly engaged the enemy, butpreviously, in the capacity of farmer of the revenue, by iniquitouspractices of every description, had shown himself faithless andinjurious to the state, as well as the companies. Among the Lucanians,the consul, Sempronius, fought several small battles, but none worthyof being recorded, he also took several inconsiderable towns. Inproportion as the war was protracted, and the sentiments no less thanthe circumstances of men fluctuated accordingly as events flowedprosperously or otherwise, the citizens were seized with such apassion for superstitious observances, and those for the most partintroduced from foreign countries, that either the people or the godsappeared to have undergone a sudden change. And now the Roman riteswere growing into disuse, not only in private, and within doors, butin public also; in the forum and Capitol there were crowds of womensacrificing, and offering up prayers to the gods, in modes unusual inthat country. A low order of sacrificers and soothsayers had enslavedmen's understandings, and the numbers of these were increased by thecountry people, whom want and terror had driven into the city, fromthe fields which were lain uncultivated during a protracted war, andhad suffered from the incursions of the enemy, and by the profitablecheating in the ignorance of others which they carried on like anallowed and customary trade. At first, good men gave protest inprivate to the indignation they felt at these proceedings, butafterwards the thing came before the fathers, and formed a matter ofpublic complaint. The aediles and triumviri, appointed for theexecution of criminals, were severely reprimanded by the senate fornot preventing these irregularities, but when they attempted to removethe crowd of persons thus employed from the forum, and to overthrowthe preparations for their sacred rites, they narrowly escapedpersonal injury. It being now evident, that the evil was too powerfulto be checked by inferior magistrates, the senate commissioned MarcusAtilius, the city praetor, to rid the people of these superstitions.He called an assembly, in which he read the decree of the senate, andgave notice, that all persons who had any books of divination, orforms of prayer, or any written system of sacrificing, should lay allthe aforesaid books and writings before him before the calends ofApril; and that no person should sacrifice in any public orconsecrated place according to new or foreign rites."Book 25,Chapter 2,"Several of the public priests too died this year: Lucius CorneliusLentulus, chief pontiff, Caius Papirius Maso, son of Caius, a pontiff,Publius Furius Philo, an augur, and Caius Papirius Maso, son ofLucius, a decemvir for the superintendence of sacred rites. In lieu ofLentulus, Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, in lieu of Papirius Cnaeius,Servilius Caepio, were created pontiffs. Lucius Quinctius Flaminiuswas created augur, and Lucius Cornelius Lentulus decemvir for thesuperintendence of sacred rites. The time for the election of consulswas now approaching; but as it was not thought proper to call theconsuls away from the war with which they were intently occupied,Tiberius Sempronius, the consul, nominated Caius Claudius Centho asdictator to hold the election. He appointed Quintus Fulvius Flaccus ashis master of the horse. On the first day on which the election couldbe held, the dictator appointed as consuls, Quintus Fulvius Flaccus,his master of the horse, and Appius Claudius Pulcher, who had held thegovernment of Sicily as praetor. The praetors created were CneiusFulvius Flaccus, Caius Claudius Nero, Marcus Junius Silanus, PubliusCornelius Sulla. The election completed, the dictator retired from hisoffice. This year, Publius Cornelius Scipio, afterwards surnamedAfricanus, held the office of curule aedile, with Marcus CorneliusCethegus; and when the tribunes of the people opposed his pretensionsto the aedileship, alleging, that no notice ought to be taken of him,because he had not attained the legal age for candidateship, heobserved, ""if the citizens in general are desirous of appointing meaedile, I am old enough."" Upon this the people ran to their respectivetribes to give their votes, with feelings so strongly disposed in hisfavour, that the tribunes on a sudden abandoned their attempt. Thelargesses bestowed by the aediles were the following: the Roman gameswere sumptuously exhibited, considering the present state of theirresources; they were repeated during one day, and a gallon of oil wasgiven to each street. Lucius Villius Tapulus, and Marcus FundaniusFundulus, the plebeian aediles, accused some matrons of misconductbefore the people, and some of them they convicted and sent intoexile. The plebeian games were repeated during two days, and a feastin honour of Jupiter was celebrated on occasion of the games."Book 25,Chapter 3,"Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, for the third time, and Appius Claudiusentered upon the office of consuls. The praetors determined theirprovinces by lot. Publius Cornelius Sulla received both the city andthe foreign jurisdiction, formerly allotted to two persons, CneiusFulvius Flaccus, Apulia, Caius Claudius Nero, Suessula, and MarcusJunius Silanus, Tuscany. To the consuls the conduct of the war withHannibal was decreed with two legions each, one taking the troops ofQuintus Fabius, the consul of the former year, the other those ofFulvius Centumalus. Of the praetors, Fulvius Flaccus was to have thelegions which were in Luceria under Aemilius the praetor, NeroClaudius those in Picenum under Caius Terentius, each raising recruitsfor himself to fill up the number of his troops. To Marcus Junius thecity legions of the former year were assigned, to be employed againstthe Tuscans. Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and Publius SemproniusTuditanus were continued in command in their provinces of Lucania andGaul with the armies they had, as was also Publius Lentulus in thatpart of Sicily which formed the ancient Roman province. MarcusMarcellus had Syracuse, and that which was the kingdom of Hiero. TitusOtacilius was continued in the command of the fleet, Marcus Valeriusin that of Greece, Quintus Mucius Scaevola in that of Sardinia. TheCornelii, Publius and Cneius, were continued in the command of Spain.In addition to the armies already existing, two legions for theservice of the city were levied by the consuls, and a total oftwenty-three legions was made up this year. The levy of the consulswas impeded by the conduct of Marcus Posthumius Pyrgensis, almostaccompanied with a serious disturbance. Posthumius was a farmer of therevenue, who, for knavery and rapacity, practised through a course ofmany years, had no equal except Titus Pomponius Veientanus, who hadbeen taken prisoner the former year by the Carthaginians under theconduct of Hanno, while carelessly ravaging the lands in Lucania. Asthe state had taken upon itself the risk of any loss which might arisefrom storms to the commodities conveyed to the armies, not only hadthese two men fabricated false accounts of shipwrecks, but even thosewhich had really occurred were occasioned by their own knavery, andnot by accident. Their plan was to put a few goods of little valueinto old and shattered vessels, which they sank in the deep, taking upthe sailors in boats prepared for the purpose, and then returningfalsely the cargo as many times more valuable than it was. Thisfraudulent practice had been pointed out to Marcus Atilius, thepraetor in a former year, who had communicated it to the senate; nodecree, however, had been passed censuring it, because the fatherswere unwilling that any offence should be given to the order ofrevenue farmers while affairs were in such a state. The people wereseverer avengers of the fraud; and at length two tribunes of thepeople, Spurius and Lucius Carvilius, being moved to take some activemeasure, as they saw that this conduct excited universal disgust, andhad become notorious, proposed that a fine of two hundred thousandasses should be imposed on Marcus Posthumius. When the day arrived forarguing the question, the people assembled in such numbers, that thearea of the Capitol could scarcely contain them; and the cause havingbeen gone through, the only hope of safety which presented itself was,that Caius Servilius Casca, a tribune of the people, a connexion andrelation of Posthumius, should interpose his protest before the tribeswere called to give their votes. The witnesses having been produced,the tribunes caused the people to withdraw, and the urn was brought,in order that the tribes should draw lots which should give the votefirst. Meanwhile, the farmers of the revenue urged Casca to stop theproceedings for that day. The people, however, loudly opposed it; andCasca happened to be sitting on the most prominent part of therostrum, whose mind fear and shame were jointly agitating. Seeing thatno dependence was to be placed in him for protection, the farmers ofthe revenue, forming themselves into a wedge, rushed into the voidspace occasioned by the removal of the people for the purpose ofcausing disturbance, wrangling at the same time with the people andthe tribunes. The affair had now almost proceeded to violence, whenFulvius Flaccus, the consul, addressing the tribunes, said, ""Do younot see that you are degraded to the common rank, and that aninsurrection will be the result, unless you speedily dismiss theassembly of the commons."""Book 25,Chapter 4,"The commons being dismissed, the senate was assembled, when theconsuls proposed the consideration of the interruption experienced bythe assembly of the commons, in consequence of the violence andaudacity of the farmers of the revenue. They said, that ""Marcus FuriusCamillus, whose banishment was followed by the downfall of the city,had suffered himself to be condemned by his exasperated countrymen.That before him, the decemviri, according to whose laws they lived upto the present day, and afterwards many men of the first rank in thestate, had submitted to have sentence passed upon them by the people.But Posthumius Pyrgensis had wrested from the Roman people their rightof suffrage, had dissolved the assembly of the commons, had set atnought the authority of the tribunes, had drawn up a body of men inbattle-array against the Roman people; and seized upon a post, inorder to cut off the tribunes from the commons, and prevent the tribesbeing called to give their votes. That the only thing which hadrestrained the people from bloodshed and violence, was the forbearanceof the magistrates in giving way for the moment to the fury andaudacity of a few individuals, and suffering themselves and the Romanpeople to be overcome; and that no opportunity might be afforded thosewho were seeking an occasion of violence, in dissolving, agreeably tothe wish of the defendant himself, that assembly which he was about tointerrupt by force of arms."" Observations of this kind having beenurged with a warmth proportioned to the atrocity of the conduct whichcalled them forth, by all the most respectable persons, and the senatehaving passed a decree to the effect that the violence offered wasprejudicial to the state, and a precedent of pernicious tendency,immediately the Carvilii, tribunes of the people, giving up the actionfor a fine, appointed a day on which Posthumius should be triedcapitally, and ordered, that unless he gave bail, he should beapprehended by the beadle, and carried to prison. Posthumius gavebail, but did not appear. The tribunes then proposed to the commons,and the commons resolved, that if Marcus Posthumius did not appearbefore the calends of May, and if on being cited on that day he didnot answer, and sufficient cause were not shown why he did not, hewould be adjudged an exile, his goods would be sold, and himselfinterdicted from water and fire. They then proceeded to indictcapitally, and demand bail of each of the persons who had been thepromoters of the disorder and riot. At first they threw into prisonthose who did not give bail, and afterwards even such as could; uponwhich the greater part of them went into exile, to avoid the danger towhich this proceeding exposed them."Book 25,Chapter 5,"The knavery of the revenue farmers, and their subsequent audaciousconduct to screen themselves from its effects, thus terminated. Anassembly was then held for the creation of a chief pontiff. The newpontiff, Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, presided. The election wascontested with the greatest obstinacy by three candidates, QuintusFulvius Flaccus, the consul, who had been twice consul before andcensor, Titus Manhus Torquatus, who had himself also beendistinguished by two consulships and the censorship, and PubliusLicinius Ciassus, who was about to stand for the office of curuleaedile. In this contest, the last-mentioned candidate, though a youngman, beat the others, who were his superiors in years, and had filledoffices of honour. Before him there had not been a man for a hundredand twenty years, except Publius Cornelius Calussa, who had beencreated chief pontiff without having sat in the curule chair. Thoughthe consuls found great difficulty in completing the levy, for inconsequence of the scarcity of young men, it was not easy to procureenough for the two purposes of forming the new city legions, andrecruiting the old ones, the senate forbade them to desist from theattempt, and ordered two triumvirates to be appointed, one of whichwithin, the other without the fiftieth mile from the city, mightascertain the utmost number of free-born men which were to be found inthe villages, and market towns, and hamlets, and enlist whom theythought strong enough to bear arms, though they had not attained themilitary age. That the tribunes of the people, if they thought proper,should propose to the people, that such as should take the militaryoath being under seventeen years, should be allowed to reckon theirperiod of service in the same manner as if they had enlisted atseventeen or older. The two triumvirates, created agreeably to thisdecree of the senate, enlisted free-born men throughout the country.At the same time a letter from Marcellus from Sicily, respecting thepetition of the troops who served with Publius Lentulus, was read inthe senate. These troops were the relics of the disaster at Cannae,and had been sent out of the way into Sicily, as has been mentionedbefore, on an understanding that they should not be brought homebefore the conclusion of the Carthaginian war."Book 25,Chapter 6,"With the permission of Lentulus, these men sent the mostdistinguished of the cavalry and centurions, and a select body of thelegionary infantry, as ambassadors to Marcellus, to his winterquarters. Having obtained leave to speak, one of them thus addressedhim: ""We should have approached you, Marcus Marcellus, when consul inItaly, as soon as that decree of the senate was passed respecting us,which, though not unjust, was certainly severe, had we not hoped, thatbeing sent into a province which was in a state of disorder inconsequence of the death of its kings, to carry on an arduous waragainst the Sicilians and Carthaginians together, we should makeatonement to the state by our blood and wounds, in the same manner as,within the memory of our fathers, those who were taken prisoners byPyrrhus at Heraclea, made atonement by fighting against the samePyrrhus. And yet, for what fault of ours, conscript fathers, did youthen, or do you now, feel displeasure towards us; for when I look uponyou, Marcus Marcellus, I seem to behold both the consuls and the wholebody of the senate; and had you been our consul at Cannae, a betterfate would have attended the state as well as ourselves. Permit me, Ientreat you, before I complain of the hardship of our situation, toclear ourselves of the guilt with which we are charged. If it wasneither by the anger of the gods, nor by fate, according to whose lawsthe course of human affairs is unalterably fixed, but by misconductthat we were undone at Cannae; but whose was that misconduct; thesoldiers', or that of their generals? For my own part, I, as asoldier, will never say a word of my commander, particularly when Iknow that he received the thanks of the senate for not havingdespaired of the state; and who has been continued in command throughevery year since his flight from Cannae. We have heard that othersalso who survived that disaster, who were military tribunes, solicitand fill offices of honour, and have the command of provinces. Do youthen, conscript fathers, pardon yourselves and your children, whileyou exercise severity towards such insignificant persons as we are? Itwas no disgrace to a consul and other leading persons in the state, tofly when no other hope remained; and did you send your soldiers intothe field as persons who must of necessity die there? At the Allianearly the whole army fled; at the Caudine Forks the troops deliveredup their arms to the enemy, without even making an effort; not tomention other disgraceful defeats of our armies. Yet, so far from anymark of infamy being sought for, which might be fixed upon thesetroops, the city of Rome was recovered by means of those very troopswho had fled to Veii from the Allia; and the Caudine legions, whichhad returned to Rome without their arms, being sent back armed toSamnium, brought under the yoke that very enemy who had exulted in thedisgrace which, in this instance, attached to them. But is there a manwho can bring a charge of cowardice or running away against the armywhich fought at Cannae, where more than fifty thousand men fell; fromwhence the consul fled with only seventy horsemen; where not a mansurvived, except perchance those whom the enemy left, being weariedwith killing? When the proposal to ransom the prisoners was negatived,we were the objects of general commendation, because we reservedourselves for the service of the state; because we returned to theconsul to Venusia, and exhibited an appearance of a regular army. Nowwe are in a worse condition than those who were taken prisoners in thetime of our fathers; for they only had their arms, the nature of theirservice, and the place where they might pitch their tents in the campaltered; all which, however, they got restored by one service renderedto the state, and by one successful battle. Not one of them was sentaway into banishment; not one was deprived of the hope of completingthe period of his service; in short, an enemy was assigned to them,fighting with whom they might at once terminate their life or theirdisgrace. We, to whom nothing can be objected, except that it is owingto us that any Roman soldier has survived the battle of Cannae, areremoved far away, not only from our country and Italy, but even froman enemy; where we may grow old in exile, where we can have no hope oropportunity of obliterating our disgrace, of appeasing the indignationof our countrymen, or, in short, of obtaining an honourable death. Weseek neither to have our ignominy terminated, nor our virtue rewarded,we only ask to be allowed to make trial of our courage, and toexercise our virtue. We seek for labour and danger that we maydischarge the duty of men and soldiers. A war is carrying on inSicily, now for the second year, with the utmost vigour on both sides.The Carthaginians are storming some cities, the Romans others, armiesof infantry and horse are engaging in battle, at Syracuse the war isprosecuted by sea and by land. We hear distinctly the shout of thecombatants, and the din of arms, while we ourselves lie inactive andunemployed, as if we had neither hands nor arms. The consul,Sempronius has now fought many pitched battles with the enemy withlegions of slaves. They receive as the fruits of their exertion theirliberty, and the rights of citizens. Let us at least be employed byyou as slaves purchased for the service of this war, let us be allowedto combat with the enemy and acquire our freedom by fighting. Do youwish to make trial of our valour by sea, by land, in a pitched battle,or in the assault of towns? We ask as our portion all thoseenterprises which present the greatest difficulty and danger, thatwhat ought to have been done at Cannae may be done as soon aspossible, for the whole of our subsequent lives has been doomed toignominy."""Book 25,Chapter 7,"At the conclusion of this speech they prostrated themselves at theknees of Marcellus. Marcellus replied, that the question was neitherwithin his authority nor his power, that he would, however, write tothe senate, and be guided in every thing he did by the judgment of thefathers. This letter was brought to the new consuls, and by them readin the senate, and, on the question being put relative to this letter,they decreed, ""that the senate saw no reason why the interests of therepublic should be intrusted to the hands of soldiers who had desertedthen comrades, in battle, at Cannae. If Marcus Marcellus, theproconsul, thought otherwise, that he should act as he deemedconsistent with the good of the republic and his own honour, with thisproviso, however, that none of these men should be exempt fromservice, nor be presented with any military reward in consideration ofvalour, or be conveyed back to Italy, while the enemy was in thatcountry."" After this, agreeably to the decree of the senate, and theorder of the people, an election was held by the city praetor, atwhich five commissioners were created for the purpose of repairing thewalls and turrets, and two sets of triumviri, one to search for theproperty belonging to the temples, and to register the offerings, theother for repairing the temples of Fortune and Mother Matuta withinthe Carmental gate, and also that of Hope without the gate, which hadbeen destroyed by fire the year before. Dreadful storms occurred atthis time. It rained stones for two days without intermission in theAlban mount. Many places were struck by lightning; two buildings inthe Capitol, the rampart in the camp above Suessula in many places,and two of the men on guard were killed. A wall and certain towers atCannae were not only struck with lightning, but demolished. At Reate,a vast rock was seen to fly about; the sun appeared unusually red andblood-like. On account of these prodigies there was a supplication forone day, and the consuls employed themselves for several days insacred rites; at the same time there was a sacred rite performedthrough nine days. An accidental circumstance which occurred at adistance, hastened the revolt of Tarentum, which had now for a longtime been the object of the hopes of Hannibal and of the suspicion ofthe Romans. Phileas, a native of Tarentum, who had been a long time atRome under the pretence of an embassy, being a man of a restless mind,and ill brooking that inactive state in which he considered that hispowers had been for too long a time sinking into imbecility,discovered for himself a means of access to the Tarentine hostages.They were kept in the court of the temple of Liberty, and guarded withless care, because it was neither the interest of themselves nor oftheir state to escape from the Romans. By corrupting two of thekeepers of the temple, he was enabled to hold frequent conferenceswith them, at which he solicited them to come into this design; andhaving brought them out of their place of confinement as soon as itwas dark, he became the companion of their clandestine flight, and gotclear away. As soon as day dawned, the news of their escape spreadthrough the city, and a party sent in pursuit, having seized them allat Tarracina, brought them back. They were led into the Comitium, andafter being scourged with rods, with the approbation of the people,were thrown down from the rock."Book 25,Chapter 8,"The severity of this punishment exasperated the inhabitants of twoof the most distinguished Greek states in Italy, not only publicly ascommunities, but privately as individuals, according as each wasconnected, either by relationship or friendship, with those who hadbeen so disgracefully put to death. Of these about thirteen nobleTarentine youths formed a conspiracy, the chief of whom were Nico andPhilemenus. Concluding that it would be right to confer with Hannibalbefore they took any step, they went to him, having been allowed to goout of the city by night on pretence of hunting. When they were nownot far from the camp, all the rest hid themselves in a wood by theroad side; but Nico and Philemenus, proceeding to the advanced guard,were seized, and at their own request brought before Hannibal. Havinglaid before him the motives of their plan, and the object they had inview, they received the highest commendation, and were loaded withpromises; and that their countrymen might believe that they had goneout of the city to obtain plunder, they were desired to drive to thecity some cattle of the Carthaginians which had been sent out tograze. A promise was given them that they might do this without dangeror interruption. The booty of the young men attracted notice, and lessastonishment was therefore felt that they should frequently repeat theattempt. At a second meeting with Hannibal they entered into a solemnengagement, that the Tarentines should be free, enjoying their ownlaws, and all their rights uninterfered with; that they should neitherpay any tribute to the Carthaginians, nor receive a garrison againsttheir will; that their present garrison should be delivered up to theCarthaginians. These points being agreed upon, Philemenus then beganto repeat more frequently his customary practice of going out andreturning to the city followed by his dogs, and furnished with theother requisites for hunting; for he was remarkable for his fondnessof hunting; and generally bringing home something which he hadcaptured or taken away from the enemy, who had purposely placed it inhis way he presented it to the commander or the guards of the gates.They supposed that he preferred going and returning by night throughfear of the enemy. After this practice had become so familiar, that atwhatever time of the night he gave a signal, by whistling, the gatewas opened, Hannibal thought that it was now time to put the plan inexecution. He was at the distance of three days' journey, and todiminish the wonder which would be felt at his keeping his camp fixedin one and the same place so long, he feigned himself ill. Even to theRomans who formed the garrison of Tarentum, his protracted inactivityhad ceased to be an object of suspicion."Book 25,Chapter 9,"But after he determined to proceed to Tarentum, selecting from hisinfantry and cavalry ten thousand men, whom, from activity of body,and lightness of arms, he judged best adapted for the expedition, hebegan his march in the fourth watch of the night; and sending inadvance about eighty Numidian horsemen, ordered them to scour thecountry on each side of the road, and narrowly examine every place,lest any of the rustics who might have observed his army at a distanceshould escape; to bring back those who were got before, and kill thosewhom they met, that they might appear to the neighbouring inhabitantsto be a plundering party, rather than a regular army. Hannibalhimself, marching at a rapid pace, pitched his camp about fifteenmiles from Tarentum; and without telling his soldiers even there, whatwas their destination, he only called them together and admonishedthem to march all of them in the road, and not to suffer any one toturn aside or deviate from the line; and above all, that they would beon the watch, so as to catch the word of command, and not do any thingwithout the order of their leaders; that in due time he would issuehis commands as to what he wished to be done. About the same hour arumour reached Tarentum, that a few Numidian horsemen were devastatingthe fields, and had terrified the rustics through a wide extent ofcountry; at which intelligence the Roman praefect took no further stepthan to order a division of his cavalry to go out the following day atsunrise to check the depredations of the enemy; and so far was he fromdirecting his attention to any thing else on this account, that on thecontrary, this excursion of the Numidians was a proof to him thatHannibal and his army had not moved from his camp. Early in the nightHannibal put his troops in motion, and Philemenus, with his customaryburden of prey taken in hunting, was his guide. The rest of theconspirators waited the accomplishment of what had been concerted; andthe agreement was, that Philemenus, while bringing in his prey throughthe small gate by which he was accustomed to pass, should introducesome armed men, while Hannibal in another quarter approached the gatecalled Temenis, which faced the east, in that quarter which wastowards the continent, near the tombs which were within the walls.When he drew near to the gate, Hannibal raised a fire according toagreement, which made a blaze; the same signal was returned by Nico,and the fires were extinguished on both sides. Hannibal led his troopson in silence to the gate. Nico suddenly fell upon the guards whileasleep, slew them in their beds, and opened the gate. Hannibal thenentered with his infantry, ordering his cavalry to stay behind, thatthey might be able to bring their assistance wherever it was requiredwithout obstruction. Philemenus also in another quarter approached thesmall gate by which he was accustomed to pass and re-pass. His voice,which was well known, for he said he could scarcely bear the weight ofthe huge beast he had gotten, and his signal, which had now becomefamiliar, having roused the guard, the small gate was opened. Twoyouths carrying in a boar, Philemenus himself followed, with ahuntsman, unencumbered, and while the attention of the guard wasincautiously turned upon those who carried the boar, in consequence ofits astonishing size, he transfixed him with a hunting spear. Aboutthirty armed men then entering, slew the rest of the guards, and brokeopen the adjoining gate, when a body of troops, in regular array,instantly rushed in. Being conducted hence in silence to the forum,they joined Hannibal. The Carthaginian then sent the Tarentines, withtwo thousand Gauls formed into three divisions, in differentdirections through the city, with orders to occupy the most frequentedstreets. A confusion arising, the Romans were put to the sword on allhands. The townsmen were spared; but in order to insure this, heinstructed the Tarentine youths, when they saw any of their friends ata distance, to bid them be quiet and silent, and be of good courage."Book 25,Chapter 10,"The tumult and clamour was now such as usually takes place in acaptured city, but no man knew for certain what was the occasion. TheTarentines supposed that the Romans had suddenly risen to plunder thecity. To the Romans it appeared, that some commotion had been set onfoot by the townsmen with a treacherous design. The praefect, who wasawakened at the first alarm, escaped to the port, whence getting intoa boat he was conveyed round to the citadel. The sound of a trumpetalso from the theatre excited alarm; for it was a Roman trumpet,prepared by the conspirators for this very purpose; and as it wasblown unskilfully by a Grecian, it could not be ascertained who gavethe signal, or to whom it was given. At dawn of the day, the Romansrecognised the Carthaginian and Gallic arms, which removed all doubt;and the Greeks, seeing the bodies of slain Romans spread about in alldirections, perceived that the city had been taken by Hannibal. Whenthe light had increased, so that they could discriminate with greatercertainty, and the Romans who survived the carnage had taken refuge inthe citadel, the tumult now beginning to subside a little, Hannibalgave orders to assemble the Tarentines without their arms. All of themattended the assembly, except those who had accompanied the Romans intheir retreat to the citadel, to share every fortune with them. HereHannibal having addressed the Tarentines in terms of kindness, andappealed to the services he had rendered to those of their countrymenwhom he had captured at the Trasimenus and at Cannae, and having atthe same time inveighed against the haughty domination of the Romans,desired that they would every one of them retire to their respectivehouses, and inscribe their names upon their doors; declaring, that heshould give orders that those houses which had not the names writtenupon them should be plundered. That if any man should write his nameupon the house of a Roman, (and the Romans occupied houses bythemselves,) he should treat him as an enemy. Having dismissed theassembly, and the names inscribed upon the doors having made it easyto distinguish the house of an enemy from that of a friend, on asignal given, the troops ran in every direction to plunder thelodgings of the Romans, and a considerable booty was found."Book 25,Chapter 11,"The next day he led his troops to assault the citadel; but seeingthat it was protected by very high rocks towards the sea, which washedthe greater part of it, and formed it into a sort of peninsula, andtowards the city by a wall and ditch, and consequently that it couldnot be taken by assault or by works; lest the design to protect theTarentines should detain him from the prosecution of more importantobjects, and lest the Romans should have the power of sallying fromthe citadel whenever they pleased against the Tarentines, if leftwithout a strong protecting force, he resolved to cut off thecommunication between the citadel and city by a rampart; not without ahope that he might have an opportunity of fighting with the Romans,when attempting to obstruct the work; and if they should sally forthtoo eagerly, that by killing many of them the strength of the garrisonwould be so far reduced, that the Tarentines alone would be easilyable to defend themselves from them. After they had begun, the Romans,suddenly throwing open the gate, rushed in upon the workmen. The guardstationed before the works allowed itself to be driven back, in orderthat their boldness might be increased by success, and that they mightpursue them when driven back, in greater numbers, and to a greaterdistance. Then on a signal given, the Carthaginians, whom Hannibalkept in readiness for this purpose, sprang up on all sides; nor couldthe Romans sustain the attack, but were prevented from precipitateflight by the narrowness of the ground, by impediments occasioned insome places by the works already commenced, in others by thepreparations for the work. Most of them were driven headlong into theditch, and more were killed in the flight than in the battle. Afterthis the work was commenced without any attempt to obstruct it. Alarge ditch was formed, within which a rampart was thrown up. Heprepared also to add a wall at a small distance, and on the same side,that they might defend themselves from the Romans even without agarrison. He, however, left them a small force, at once for theirprotection and to assist in building the wall. The general himself,setting out with the rest of his forces, pitched his camp at the riverGalaesus, five miles from the city. Returning from this position toinspect the work, which had gone on somewhat faster than he hadanticipated, he conceived a hope that the citadel might even be takenby storm; for it was not protected by an elevated situation as theother parts were, but placed upon a plain, and separated from the cityonly by a wall and ditch. While subjected to an attack from every kindof military engine and work, a reinforcement sent from Metapontuminspired the Romans with courage to assault the works of the enemy, bya sudden attack, under cover of the night. Some of them they threwdown, others they destroyed by fire, and thus there was an end toHannibal's attempts against the citadel in that quarter. His onlyremaining hope was in a siege; nor did that afford a good prospect ofsuccess, because, occupying a citadel which was placed on a peninsulaand commanded the entrance of the harbour, they had the sea open tothem, while the city, on the contrary, was deprived of any supplies bysea: and thus the besiegers were in greater danger of want than thebesieged. Hannibal assembled the chief men of the Tarentines, and laidbefore them all the present difficulties. He said, ""That he couldneither discover any method by which a citadel so well fortified couldbe taken, nor could he hope for any favourable result from a siege,while the enemy was master of the sea; but that if ships could beobtained, by which the introduction of supplies might be prevented,the enemy would either immediately evacuate it, or surrenderthemselves."" The Tarentines agreed with him; but were of opinion, that""he who gave the advice ought also to assist in carrying it intoexecution; for if the Carthaginian ships were brought there fromSicily, they would be able to effect it; but by what means could theirown ships, shut up as they were in a confined harbour, the mouth ofwhich was in the command of the enemy, be brought out into the opensea."" ""They shall be brought out,"" said Hannibal. ""Many things whichare difficult in themselves, are easily effected by contrivance. Youhave a city situated upon a plain; you have level and sufficientlywide roads extending in every direction. By the road which runsthrough the midst of the city from the harbour to the sea I willconvey your ships in waggons without any great difficulty, and the seawill be ours which the enemy now commands. We will invest the citadelon one side by sea, on the other by land; nay, rather, in a shorttime, we will take it either abandoned by the enemy, or with the enemyin it."" This speech not only inspired hopes of accomplishing theobject, but excited the greatest admiration of the general. Waggonswere immediately collected from every quarter and joined together;machines were employed to haul the ships on shore, and the road wasprepared, in order that the waggons might run more easily, and thusthe difficulty of passing be diminished. Beasts of burden and men werenext collected, and the work was actively commenced. After the lapseof a few days, the fleet, equipped and ready for action, sailed roundthe citadel, and cast anchor just before the mouth of the harbour.Such was the state of things at Tarentum, when Hannibal left it andreturned to his winter quarters. Authors, however, are divided as towhether the defection of the Tarentines took place in the present orformer year. The greater number, and those who, from their age, weremore able to recollect these events, represent it to have occurred inthe present year."Book 25,Chapter 12,"The Latin holidays detained the consuls and praetors at Rome tillthe fifth of the calends of May; on which day, having completed thesolemnities on the mount, they proceeded to their respectiveprovinces. Afterwards a new difficulty respecting religious mattersarose out of the prophetic verses of Marcius, who had been adistinguished soothsayer; and on a search being made the year before,for books of this description, agreeably to a decree of the senate,these verses had fallen into the hands of Marcus Atilius, the citypraetor, who had the management of that business, and he hadimmediately handed them over to the new praetor, Sulla. The importanceattached to one of the two predictions of Marcius, which was broughtto light after the event to which it related had occurred, and thetruth of which was confirmed by the event, attached credence to theother, the time of whose fulfilment had not yet arrived. In the formerprophecy, the disaster at Cannae was predicted in nearly these words:""Roman of Trojan descent, fly the river Canna, lest foreigners shouldcompel thee to fight in the plain of Diomede. But thou wilt notbelieve me until thou shalt have filled the plain with blood, and theriver carries into the great sea, from the fruitful land, manythousands of your slain countrymen, and thy flesh becomes a prey forfishes, birds, and beasts inhabiting the earth. For thus hath Jupiterdeclared to me."" Those who had served in that quarter recognised thecorrespondence with respect to the plains of the Argive Diomede andthe river Canna, as well as the defeat itself. The other prophecy wasthen read, which was more obscure, not only because future events aremore uncertain than past, but also from being more perplexed in itsstyle of composition. ""Romans, if you wish to expel the enemy and theulcer which has come from afar, I advise, that games should be vowed,which may be performed in a cheerful manner annually to Apollo; whenthe people shall have given a portion of money from the publiccoffers, that private individuals then contribute, each according tohis ability. That the praetor shall preside in the celebration ofthese games, who holds the supreme administration of justice to thepeople and commons. Let the decemviri perform sacrifice with victimsafter the Grecian fashion. If you do these things properly you willever rejoice, and your affairs will be more prosperous, for that deitywill destroy your enemies who now, composedly, feed upon your plains.""They took one day to explain this prophecy. The next day a decree ofthe senate was passed, that the decemviri should inspect the booksrelating to the celebration of games and sacred rites in honour ofApollo. After they had been consulted, and a report made to thesenate, the fathers voted, that ""games should be vowed to Apollo andcelebrated; and that when the games were concluded, twelve thousand_asses_ should be given to the praetor to defray the expense ofsacred ceremonies, and also two victims of the larger sort."" A seconddecree was passed, that ""the decemviri should perform sacrifice in theGrecian mode, and with the following victims: to Apollo, with a gildedox, and two white goats gilded; to Latona, with a gilded heifer."" Whenthe praetor was about to celebrate the games in the Circus Maximus, heissued an order, that during the celebration of the games, the peopleshould pay a contribution, as large as was convenient, for the serviceof Apollo. This is the origin of the Apollinarian games, which werevowed and celebrated in order to victory, and not restoration tohealth, as is commonly supposed. The people viewed the spectacle ingarlands; the matrons made supplications; the people in generalfeasted in the courts of their houses, throwing the doors open; andthe day was distinguished by every description of ceremony."Book 25,Chapter 13,"While Hannibal was in the neighbourhood of Tarentum, and both theconsuls in Samnium, though they seemed as if they were about tobesiege Capua, the Campanians were experiencing famine, that calamitywhich is the usual attendant of a protracted siege. It was occasionedby the Roman armies' having prevented the sowing of the lands. Theytherefore sent ambassadors to Hannibal, imploring him to give ordersthat corn should be conveyed to Capua from the neighbouring places,before both the consuls led their legions into their fields, and allthe roads were blocked up by the troops of the enemy. Hannibal orderedHanno to pass with his army from Bruttium into Campania, and to takecare that the Campanians were supplied with corn. Hanno, setting outfrom Bruttium with his army, and carefully avoiding the camp of theenemy and the consuls who were in Samnium, when he drew near toBeneventum, pitched his camp on an eminence three miles from the city.He next ordered that the corn which had been collected during thesummer, should be brought from the neighbouring people in alliancewith him, into his camp, assigning a guard to escort those supplies.He then sent a messenger to the Capuans, fixing a day when they shouldattend at his camp to receive the corn, bringing with them vehiclesand beasts of every description, collected from every part of theircountry. The Campanians executed this business with their usualindolence and carelessness. Somewhat more than four hundred vehicles,with a few beasts of burden besides, were sent. After receiving areproof from Hanno for this conduct, who told them, that not evenhunger, which excited dumb animals to exertion, could stimulate themto diligence, another day was named when they were to fetch the cornafter better preparation. All these transactions being reported to theBeneventans, just as they occurred, they lost no time in sending tenambassadors to the Roman consuls, who were encamped in theneighbourhood of Bovianum. The consuls, hearing what was going on atCapua, arranged it so that one of them should lead an army intoCampania; and Fulvius, to whose lot that province had fallen, settingout by night, entered the walls of Beneventum. Being now near theenemy, he obtained information that Hanno had gone out to forage witha portion of his troops; that the Campanians were supplied with cornby a quaestor; that two thousand waggons had arrived together with anundisciplined and unarmed rabble; that every thing was done in adisorderly and hurried manner; and that the form of a camp, and allmilitary subordination, were destroyed by the intermixture of rusticsout of the neighbourhood. This intelligence being sufficientlyauthenticated, the consul ordered his soldiers to get ready only theirstandards and arms against the next night, as he must attack theCarthaginian camp. They set out at the fourth watch of the night,leaving all their packages and baggage of every description atBeneventum; and arriving a little before daylight at the camp, theyoccasioned such a panic, that, had the camp been situated on levelground, it might doubtlessly have been taken on the first assault. Theheight of its situation and the works defended it; for they could notbe approached on any side except by a steep and difficult ascent. Atbreak of day a hot engagement commenced, when the Carthaginians notonly defended their rampart, but having more even ground, threw downthe enemy as they attempted to ascend the steep."Book 25,Chapter 14,"Persevering courage, however, at length prevailed over everyimpediment, and they made their way up to the ditch and rampart inseveral parts at the same time, but with many wounds and much loss ofsoldiers. The consul, therefore assembling the military tribunes, saidthey must desist from this inconsiderate enterprise; and that itappeared to him to be the safer course, that the troops should be ledback to Beneventum for that day, and then on the following day topitch his camp close to that of the enemy, so that the Campanianscould not quit it, nor Hanno return to it; and in order that thatobject might be attained with the greater ease, that he should sendfor his colleague and his army; and that they would direct their wholeforce on that point. This plan of the general was disconcerted, afterthe signal began to sound for a retreat, by the clamours of thesoldiery, who despised so pusillanimous an order. Nearest to the gateof the enemy's camp was a Pelignian cohort, whose commander, VibiusAccuaeus, seizing the standard, threw it over the rampart. Thenpronouncing a curse upon himself and his cohort, if the enemy gotpossession of that standard, he rushed forward before the rest, andcrossing the ditch and rampart, burst into the camp of the enemy. ThePelignians were now fighting within the rampart, when in anotherquarter Valerius Flaccus, a military tribune of the third legion,taunting the Romans with cowardice for conceding to allies the honourof taking the camp. Titus Pedanius, first centurion of the firstcentury, snatched the standard out of the hands of thestandard-bearer, and cried out, ""Soon shall this standard, and thiscenturion, be within the rampart of the enemy; let those follow whowould prevent the standard's being captured by the enemy."" Crossingthe ditch, he was followed first by the men of his own maniple, andthen by the whole legion. By this time the consul also, changing hisplan on seeing them crossing the rampart, began to incite andencourage his soldiers, instead of calling them off; representing tothem, how critical and perilous was the situation of the bravestcohort of their allies and a legion of their countrymen. All,therefore, severally exerting themselves to the utmost, regardlesswhether the ground were even or uneven, while showers of weapons werethrown against them from all sides, the enemy opposing their arms andtheir persons to obstruct them, made their way and burst in. Many whowere wounded, even those whose blood and strength failed them, pressedforward, that they might fall within the rampart of the enemy. Thecamp, therefore, was taken in an instant, as if it had been situatedupon level ground, and not completely fortified. What followed was acarnage rather than a battle. The troops of both sides being huddledtogether within the rampart, above six thousand of the enemy wereslain; above seven thousand, together with the Campanians who fetchedthe corn, and the whole collection of waggons and beasts of burden,were captured. There was also a great booty, which Hanno in hispredatory excursions, which he had been careful to make in everyquarter, had drawn together from the lands of the allies of theRomans. After throwing down the camp of the enemy, they returnedthence to Beneventum; and there both the consuls (for Appius Claudiuscame thither a few days after) sold the booty and distributed it,making presents to those by whose exertions the camp of the enemy hadbeen captured; above all, to Accuaeus the Pelignian, and TitusPedanius, first centurion of the third legion. Hanno, setting off fromCominium in the territory of Cere, whither intelligence of the loss ofthe camp had reached him, with a small party of foragers, whom hehappened to have with him, returned to Bruttium, more after the mannerof a flight than a march."Book 25,Chapter 15,"The Campanians, when informed of the disaster which had befallenthemselves and their allies, sent ambassadors to Hannibal to informhim, that ""the two consuls were at Beneventum, which was a day's marchfrom Capua; that the war was all but at their gates and their walls;and that if he did not hasten to their assistance, Capua would fallinto the power of the enemy sooner than Arpi had; that not evenTarentum itself, much less its citadel, ought to be considered of somuch consequence as to induce him to deliver up to the Roman people,abandoned and undefended, Capua, which he used to place on an equalfooting with Carthage."" Hannibal, promising that he would not neglectthe interest of the Campanians, sent, for the present, two thousandhorse, with the ambassadors, aided by which, they might secure theirlands from devastation. The Romans, meanwhile, among the other thingswhich engaged their attention, had an eye to the citadel of Tarentum,and the garrison besieged therein. Caius Servilius,lieutenant-general, having been sent, according to the advice of thefathers, by Publius Cornelius, the praetor, to purchase corn inEtruria, made his way into the harbour of Tarentum, through theguard-ships of the enemy, with some ships of burden. At his arrival,those who before, having very slight hopes of holding out, werefrequently invited by the enemy, in conferences, to pass over to them,now, on the contrary, were the persons to invite and solicit the enemyto come over to them; and now, as the soldiers who were at Metapontumhad been brought to assist in guarding the citadel of Tarentum, thegarrison was sufficiently powerful. In consequence of this measure,the Metapontines, being freed from the fears which had influencedthem, immediately revolted to Hannibal. The people of Thurium,situated on the same coast, did the same. They were influenced notmore by the defection of the Metapontines and Tarentines, with whomthey were connected, being sprung from the same country, Achaia, thanby resentment towards the Romans, in consequence of the recentexecution of the hostages. The friends and relations of these hostagessent a letter and a message to Hanno and Mago, who were not far offamong the Bruttii, to the effect, that if they brought their troops upto the walls, they would deliver the city into their hands. MarcusAtinius was in command at Thurium, with a small garrison, who theythought might easily be induced to engage rashly in a battle, not fromany confidence which he reposed in his troops, of which he had veryfew, but in the youth of Thurium, whom he had purposely formed intocenturies, and armed against emergencies of this kind. The generals,after dividing their forces between them, entered the territory ofThurium; and Hanno, with a body of infantry, proceeded towards thecity in hostile array. Hanno staid behind with the cavalry, under thecover of some hills, conveniently placed for the concealment of anambush. Atinius, having by his scouts discovered only the body ofinfantry, led his troops into the field, ignorant both of the domestictreachery and of the stratagem of the enemy. The engagement with theinfantry was particularly dull, a few Romans in the first rankengaging while the Thurians rather waited than helped on the issue.The Carthaginian line retreated, on purpose that they might draw theincautious enemy to the back of the hill, where their cavalry werelying in ambush; and when they had come there, the cavalry rising upon a sudden with a shout, immediately put to flight the almostundisciplined rabble of the Thurians, not firmly attached to the sideon which they fought. The Romans, notwithstanding they were surroundedand hard pressed on one side by the infantry, on the other by thecavalry, yet prolonged the battle for a considerable time; but atlength even they were compelled to turn their backs, and fled towardsthe city. There the conspirators, forming themselves into a densebody, received the multitude of their countrymen with open gates; butwhen they perceived that the routed Romans were hurrying towards thecity, they exclaimed that the Carthaginian was close at hand, and thatthe enemy would enter the city mingled with them, unless they speedilyclosed the gates. Thus they shut out the Romans, and left them to becut up by the enemy. Atinius, however, and a few others were taken in.After this for a short time there was a division between them, somebeing of opinion that they ought to defend the city, others that theyought, after all that had happened, to yield to fortune, and deliverup the city to the conquerors; but, as it generally happens, fortuneand evil counsels prevailed. Having conveyed Atinius and his party tothe sea and the ships, more because they wished that care should betaken of him, in consequence of the mildness and justice of hiscommand, than from regard to the Romans, they received theCarthaginians into the city. The consuls led their legions fromBeneventum into the Campanian territory, with the intention not onlyof destroying the corn, which was in the blade, but of laying siege toCapua; considering that they would render their consulate illustriousby the destruction of so opulent a city, and that they would wipe awaythe foul disgrace of the empire, from the defection of a city so nearremaining unpunished for three years. Lest, however, Beneventum shouldbe left without protection, and that in case of any sudden emergency,if Hannibal should come to Capua, in order to bring assistance to hisfriends, which they doubted not he would do, the cavalry might be ableto sustain his attack, they ordered Tiberius Gracchus to come fromLucania to Beneventum with his cavalry and light-armed troops and toappoint some person to take the command of the legions and stationarycamp, for the defence of Lucania."Book 25,Chapter 16,"An unlucky prodigy occurred to Gracchus, while sacrificing,previous to his departure from Lucania. Two snakes gliding from asecret place to the entrails, after the sacrifice was completed, atethe liver; and after having been observed, suddenly vanished out ofsight. The sacrifice having been repeated according to the admonitionof the aruspices, and the vessel containing the entrails being watchedwith increased attention, it is reported that the snakes came asecond, and a third time, and, after tasting the liver, went awayuntouched. Though the aruspices forewarned him that the portent hadreference to the general, and that he ought to be on his guard againstsecret enemies and machinations, yet no foresight could avert thedestiny which awaited him. There was a Lucanian, named Flavius, theleader of that party which adhered to the Romans when the others wentover to Hannibal; he was this year in the magistracy, having beencreated praetor by the same party. Suddenly changing his mind, andseeking to ingratiate himself with the Carthaginians, he did not thinkit enough that he himself should pass over to them, or that he shouldinduce the Lucanians to revolt with him, unless he ratified his leaguewith the enemy with the head and blood of the general, betrayed tothem, though his guest. He entered into a secret conference with Mago,who had the command in Bruttium, and receiving a solemn promise fromhim, that he would take the Lucanians into his friendship, withoutinterfering with their laws, if he should betray the Roman general tothe Carthaginians, he conducted Mago to a place to which he was aboutto bring Gracchus with a few attendants. He then directed Mago to armhis infantry and cavalry, and to occupy the retired places there, inwhich he might conceal a very large number of troops. After thoroughlyinspecting and exploring the place on all sides, a day was agreed uponfor the execution of the affair. Flavius came to the Roman general,and said, that ""he had begun a business of great importance, for thecompletion of which, it was necessary to have the assistance ofGracchus himself. That he had persuaded the praetors of all the stateswhich had revolted to the Carthaginians in the general defection ofItaly, to return into the friendship of the Romans, since now theRoman power too, which had almost come to ruin by the disaster atCannae. was daily improving and increasing, while the strength ofHannibal was sinking into decay, and was almost reduced to nothing. Hehad told them that the Romans would be disposed to accept an atonementfor their former offence; that there never was any state more easy tobe entreated, or more ready to grant pardon; how often, he hadobserved to them, had they forgiven rebellion even in their ownancestors! These considerations,"" he said, ""he had himself urged, butthat they would rather hear the same from Gracchus himself in person,and touching his right hand, carry with them that pledge of faith.That he had agreed upon a place with those who were privy to thetransaction, out of the way of observation, and at no great distancefrom the Roman camp; that there the business might be settled in fewwords, so that all the Lucanian states might be in the alliance andfriendship of the Romans."" Gracchus, not suspecting any treacheryeither from his words or the nature of the proposal, and being caughtby the probability of the thing, set out from the camp with hislictors and a troop of horse, under the guidance of his host, and fellheadlong into the snare. The enemy suddenly arose from theirlurking-place, and Flavius joined them; which made the treacheryobvious. A shower of weapons was poured from all sides on Gracchus andhis troop. He immediately leaped from his horse, and ordering the restto do the same, exhorted them, that ""as fortune had left them only onecourse, they would render it glorious by their valour. And what isthere left,"" said he, ""to a handful of men, surrounded by a multitude,in a valley hemmed in by a wood and mountains, except death? The onlyquestion was, whether, tamely exposing themselves to be butchered likecattle, they should die unavenged; or whether, drawing the mind offfrom the idea of suffering and anticipation of the event, and givingfull scope to fury and resentment, they should fall while doing anddaring, covered with hostile blood, amid heaps of arms and bodies oftheir expiring foes."" He desired that ""all would aim at the Lucaniantraitor and deserter;"" adding, that ""the man who should send thatvictim to the shades before him, would acquire the most distinguishedglory, and furnish the highest consolation for his own death."" Whilethus speaking, he wound his cloak round his left arm, for they had noteven brought their shields out with them, and then rushed upon theenemy. The exertion made in the fight was greater than could beexpected from the smallness of the number. The bodies of the Romanswere most exposed to the javelins, with which, as they were thrown onall sides from higher ground into a deep valley, they were transfixed.The Carthaginians seeing Gracchus now bereft of support, endeavouredto take him alive; but he having descried his Lucanian host among theenemy, rushed with such fury into their dense body that it becameimpossible to save his life without a great loss. Mago immediatelysent his corpse to Hannibal, ordering it to be placed, with the fasceswhich were taken at the same time, before the tribunal of the general.This is the true account; Gracchus fell in Lucania, near the placecalled the Old Plains."Book 25,Chapter 17,"There are some who have put forth an account, stating, that whenin the territory of Beneventum, near the river Calor, having gone outfrom his camp with his lictors and three servants, for the purpose ofbathing, he was slain while naked and unarmed, and endeavouring todefend himself with the stones which the river brought down, by aparty of the enemy which happened to be concealed among the osierswhich grew upon the banks. Others state, that having gone out fivehundred paces from the camp, at the instance of the aruspices, inorder to expiate the prodigies before mentioned on unpolluted ground,he was cut off by two troops of Numidians who happened to be lying inambush there. So different are the accounts respecting the place andmanner of the death of so illustrious and distinguished a man. Variousalso are the accounts of the funeral of Gracchus. Some say that he wasburied by his own friends in the Roman camp; others relate, and thisis the more generally received account, that a funeral pile waserected by Hannibal, in the entrance of the Carthaginian camp; thatthe troops under arms performed evolutions, with the dances of theSpaniards, and motions of the arms and body, which were customary withthe several nations; while Hannibal himself celebrated his obsequieswith every mark of respect, both in word and deed. Such is the accountof those who assert that the affair occurred in Lucania. If you aredisposed to credit the statement of those who relate that he was slainat the river Calor, the enemy got possession only of the head ofGracchus; which being brought to Hannibal, he immediately despatchedCarthalo to convey it into the Roman camp to Cneius Cornelius, thequaestor, who buried the general in the camp, the Beneventans joiningthe army in the celebration."Book 25,Chapter 18,"The consuls having entered the Campanian territory, whiledevastating the country on all sides, were alarmed, and thrown intoconfusion, by an eruption of the townsmen and Mago with his cavalry.They called in their troops to their standards from the severalquarters to which they were dispersed, but having been routed whenthey had scarcely formed their line, they lost above fifteen hundredmen. The confidence of the Campanians, who were naturallypresumptuous, became excessive in consequence of this event, and inmany battles they challenged the Romans; but this one battle, whichthey had been incautiously and imprudently drawn into, had increasedthe vigilance of the consuls. Their spirits were restored, while thepresumption of the other party was diminished, by one triflingoccurrence; but in war nothing is so inconsiderable as not to becapable, sometimes, of producing important consequences. TitusQuinctius Crispinus was a guest of Badius, a Campanian, united withhim by the greatest intimacy. Their acquaintance had increased fromthe circumstance of Badius having received the most liberal and kindattentions at the house of Crispinus, in a fit of illness, at Rome,before the Campanian revolt. On the present occasion, Badius,advancing in front of the guards, which were stationed before thegate, desired Crispinus to be called; and Crispinus, on being informedof this, thinking that a friendly and familiar interview wasrequested, and the memory of their private connexion remaining evenamidst the disruption of public ties, advanced a little from the rest.When they had come within view of each other, Badius exclaimed, ""Ichallenge you to combat, Crispinus; let us mount our horses, andmaking the rest withdraw, let us try which is the better soldier."" Inreply, Crispinus said, that ""neither of them were in want of enemiesto display their valour upon; for his own part, even if he should meethim in the field he would turn aside, lest he should pollute hisright-hand with the blood of a guest;"" and then turning round, wasgoing away. But the Campanian, with increased presumption, began tocharge him with cowardice and effeminacy, and cast upon him reproacheswhich he deserved himself, calling him ""an enemy who sheltered himselfunder the title of host, and one who pretended to spare him for whomhe knew himself not to be a match. If he considered; that when publictreaties were broken, the ties of private connexion were not severedwith them, then Badius the Campanian openly, and in the hearing ofboth armies, renounced his connexion of hospitality with TitusQuinctius Crispinus the Roman. He said, that there could exist nofellowship or alliance with him and an enemy whose country andtutelary gods, both public and private, he had come to fight against.If he was a man, he would meet him."" Crispinus hesitated for a longtime; but the men of his troop at length prevailed upon him not toallow the Campanian to insult him with impunity. Waiting, therefore,only to ask his generals whether they would allow him to fight,contrary to rule, with an enemy who had challenged him; havingobtained their permission, he mounted his horse, and addressing Badiusby name, called him out to the combat. The Campanian made no delay.They engaged with their horses excited to hostility. Crispinustransfixed Badius with his spear in the left shoulder, over hisshield. He fell from his horse in consequence of the wound; andCrispinus leaped down to despatch him as he lay, on foot. But Badius,before his enemy was upon him, ran off to his friends, leaving hishorse and buckler. Crispinus, decorated with the spoils, anddisplaying the horse and arms which he had seized together with thebloody spear, was conducted amid the loud plaudits and congratulationsof the soldiery into the presence of the consuls, where he was highlycommended, and was presented with gifts."Book 25,Chapter 19,"Hannibal, having moved his camp from the territory of Beneventumto Capua, drew out his troops in order of battle the third day afterhis arrival; not entertaining the least doubt but that, as theCampanians had fought successfully a few days ago when he was absent,the Romans would be still less able to withstand him and his army,which had been so often victorious. After the battle had commenced,the Roman line was distressed chiefly from the attack of the cavalry,being overwhelmed with their darts, till the signal was given to theRoman cavalry to direct their horses against the enemy; thus it was abattle of the cavalry. But at this time the Sempronian army, commandedby Cneius Cornelius the quaestor, being descried at a distance,excited alarm in both parties equally, lest those who were approachingshould be fresh enemies. As if by concert, therefore, both sounded aretreat; and the troops were withdrawn from the field to their camps,in an equal condition; a greater number, however, of the Romans fellin the first charge of the cavalry. The consuls, to divert theattention of Hannibal from Capua, departed thence on the followingnight in different directions, Fulvius into the territory of Cuma,Claudius into Lucania. The next day Hannibal, having receivedintelligence that the camp of the Romans was deserted, and that theyhad gone off in different directions in two divisions, doubtful atfirst which he should follow, commenced the pursuit of Appius; who,after leading him about whichever way he pleased, returned by anotherroute to Capua. Hannibal, while in this quarter, had anotheropportunity of gaining an advantage. Marcus Centenius, surnamedPenula, was distinguished among the centurions of the first rank bythe size of his person, and his courage. Having gone through hisperiod of service, he was introduced to the senate by PubliusCornelius Sulla, when he requested of the fathers that five thousandmen might be placed at his disposal. He said, that ""as he wasacquainted with the character of the enemy, and the nature of thecountry, he should speedily perform some service; and that he wouldemploy those arts by which our generals and armies had been hithertoensnared against the inventor of them."" This was not promised morefoolishly than it was believed; as if the qualifications of a soldierand a general were the same. Instead of five, eight thousand men weregiven him, half Romans, half allies. He himself also got together aconsiderable number of volunteers, in the country, on his march; andhaving almost doubled his force, arrived in Lucania, where Hannibalhad halted after having in vain pursued Claudius. No doubt could beentertained of the issue of a contest which was to take place betweenHannibal, as general on one side, and a centurion on the other;between armies, one of which had grown old in victory, the otherentirely inexperienced, and for the most part even tumultuary andhalf-armed. As soon as the troops came within sight of each other,and neither of them declined an engagement, the lines were formed. Thebattle, notwithstanding the utter disparity of the contending parties,lasted more than two hours, the Roman troops acting with the greatestspirit as long as their general survived. But after that he hadfallen, for he continually exposed himself to the weapons of theenemy, not only from regard to his former character, but through fearof the disgrace which would attach to him if he survived a disasteroccasioned by his own temerity, the Roman line was immediately routed.But so completely were they prevented from flying, every way beingbeset by the cavalry, that scarcely a thousand men escaped out of solarge an army; the rest were destroyed on all hands, in one way orother."Book 25,Chapter 20,"The siege of Capua was now resumed by the consuls with the utmostenergy. Every thing requisite for the business was conveyed thitherand got in readiness. A store of corn was collected at Casilinum; atthe mouth of the Vulturnus, where a town now stands, a strong post wasfortified; and a garrison was stationed in Puteoli, which Fabius hadformerly fortified, in order to have the command of the neighbouringsea and the river. Into these two maritime forts, the corn recentlysent from Sicily, with that which Marcus Junius, the praetor, hadbought up in Etruria, was conveyed from Ostia, to supply the armyduring the winter. But, in addition to the disaster sustained inLucania, the army also of volunteer slaves, who had served during thelife of Gracchus with the greatest fidelity, as if discharged fromservice by the death of their general, left their standards. Hannibalwas not willing that Capua should be neglected, or his alliesdeserted, at so critical a juncture; but, having obtained such successfrom the temerity of one Roman general, his attention was fixed on theopportunity which presented itself of crushing the other general andhis army. Ambassadors from Apulia reported that Cneius Fulvius, thepraetor, had at first conducted his measures with caution, whileengaged in besieging certain towns of Apulia, which had revolted toHannibal; but that afterwards, in consequence of extraordinarysuccess, both himself and his soldiers, being glutted with booty, hadso given themselves up to licentiousness and indolence, that allmilitary discipline was disregarded. Having frequently on otheroccasions, as well as but a few days ago, experienced what an army wasgood for, when conducted by an unskilful commander, he moved his campinto Apulia."Book 25,Chapter 21,"The Roman legions, and the praetor, Fulvius, were in theneighbourhood of Herdonia, where, receiving intelligence of theapproach of the enemy, they had nearly torn up the standards and goneout to battle without the praetor's orders; nor did any thing tendmore to prevent it than the assured hope they entertained that theycould do so whenever they pleased, consulting only their own will. Thefollowing night, Hannibal having obtained information that the campwas in a state of tumult, and that most of the troops were in adisorderly manner urging the general to give the signal, and callingout to arms, and therefore feeling convinced that an opportunitypresented itself for a successful battle, distributed three thousandlight troops in the houses in the neighbourhood, and among the thornsand woods. These, on a signal being given, were to rise up from theirlurking-place with one accord; and Mago, with about two thousandhorse, was ordered to occupy all the roads in the direction in whichhe supposed their flight would be directed. Having made thesepreparations during the night, he led his troops into the field atbreak of day. Nor did Fulvius decline the challenge; not so much fromany hope of success entertained by himself, as drawn by the blindimpetuosity of his soldiers. Accordingly, the line itself was formedwith the same want of caution with which they entered the field,agreeably to the whim of the soldiers, who came up as chance directed,and took their stations just where they pleased; which they afterwardsabandoned, as fear or caprice suggested. The first legion and the leftwing of the allied troops were drawn up in front. The line wasextended to a great length, the tribunes remonstrating, that there wasno strength in it, and that wherever the enemy made the charge theywould break through it: but no salutary advice reached their minds,nor even their ears. Hannibal was now come up, a general of a totallydifferent character, with an army neither similar in its nature, norsimilarly marshalled. The consequence was, that the Romans did not somuch as sustain their shout and first attack. Their general, equal toCentenius in folly and temerity, but by no means to be compared withhim in courage, when he saw things going against him, and his troopsin confusion, hastily mounting his horse, fled from the field withabout two hundred horsemen. The rest of the troops, beaten in front,and surrounded on the flank and rear, were slaughtered to such adegree, that out of eighteen thousand men, not more than two thousandescaped. The enemy got possession of the camp."Book 25,Chapter 22,"When these disastrous defeats, happening one upon another, werereported at Rome, great grief and consternation seized the city. Butstill, as the consuls had been hitherto successful when it was mostimportant, they were the less affected by these disasters. CaiusLastorius and Marcus Metilius were sent as ambassadors to the consuls,with directions carefully to collect the remains of the two armies,and use every endeavour to prevent their surrendering themselves tothe enemy, through fear or despair, (which was the case after thebattle of Cannae,) and to search for the deserters from the army ofvolunteer slaves. Publius Cornelius was charged with the samebusiness; to him also the levy was intrusted. He caused an order to beissued throughout the market and smaller towns, that search should bemade for the volunteer slaves, and that they should be brought back totheir standards. All these things were executed with the most vigilantcare. The consul, Appius Claudius, having placed Decius Junius incommand at the mouth of the Vulturnus, and Marcus Aurelius Cotta atPuteoli, with directions to send off the corn immediately to the camp,as each of the ships from Etruria and Sardinia arrived with it,returned himself to Capua, and found his colleague Quintus Fulvius atCasilinum, conveying every requisite thence, and making everypreparation for the siege of Capua. Both of them then joined inbesieging the city, summoning Claudius Nero, the praetor, from theClaudian camp at Suessula; who, leaving a small garrison there,marched down to Capua with all the rest of his forces. Thus there werethree generals' tents erected round Capua; and three armies, applyingthemselves to the work in different parts, proceeded to surround thecity with a ditch and rampart, erecting forts at moderate intervals.The Campanians attempting to obstruct the work, a battle was fought inseveral places at once; the consequence of which was, that at lengththe Campanians confined themselves within their gates and walls.Before, however, these works were carried quite round, ambassadorswere sent to Hannibal to complain that Capua was abandoned, and almostgiven up to the Romans, and to implore him, that he would now, atleast, bring them assistance, when they were not only besieged, butsurrounded by a rampart. A letter was sent to the consuls from PubliusCornelius, the praetor, directing that before they completely enclosedCapua with their works, they should grant permission to such of theCampanians as chose to quit Capua, and take their property with them.That those should retain their liberty, and all their possessions, whoquitted it before the ides of March, but that those who quitted itafter that day, as well as those who continued there, would beconsidered as enemies. Proclamation was made to the Campanians to thiseffect, but it was received with such scorn, that they spontaneouslyused insulting language and menaces. Hannibal had marched his legionsfrom Herdonea to Tarentum, with the hope of getting possession of thecitadel of that place, by force or stratagem. But not succeedingthere, he turned his course to Brundusium, thinking that town would bebetrayed to him, but, while fruitlessly spending time there also, theCampanian ambassadors came to him with complaints and entreaties.Hannibal answered them in a proud manner, that he had before raisedthe siege of Capua, and that now the consuls would not sustain hisapproach. The ambassadors, dismissed with these hopes, with difficultyeffected their return to Capua, which was by this time surrounded by adouble trench and rampart."Book 25,Chapter 23,"At the time when the circumvallation of Capua was carrying on withthe greatest activity, the siege of Syracuse, which had been forwardedby intestine treachery, in addition to the efforts and bravery of thegeneral and his army, was brought to a conclusion. For in thebeginning of spring, Marcellus being in doubt whether he should directthe operations of the war against Himilco and Hippocrates atAgrigentum, or press the siege of Syracuse, though he saw that it wasimpossible to take the city by force, which, from its situation, bothwith respect to sea and land, was impregnable, nor by famine, as itwas supported by an uninterrupted supply of provisions from Carthage,yet that he might leave no course untried, directed the Syracusandeserters (and there were in the Roman camp some men in this situationof the highest rank, who had been driven out of the city during thedefection from the Romans, because they were averse to a change ofmeasures) to sound the feelings of those who were of the same party inconferences, and to promise them, that if Syracuse was delivered up,they should have their liberty, and be governed by their own laws.There was no opportunity however, of having a conference; for as manywere suspected of disaffection, the attention and observation of allwere exerted, lest any thing of the kind should occur unknown to them.One of the exiles, who was a servant, having been allowed to enter thecity in the character of a deserter, assembled a few persons, andopened a conversation upon the subject. After this, certain persons,covering themselves with nets in a fishing smack, were in this wayconveyed round to the Roman camp, and conferred with the fugitives.The same was frequently repeated by different parties, one afteranother; and at last they amounted to eighty. But after every thinghad been concerted for betraying the city, the plot was reported toEpicydes, by one Attalus, who felt hurt that he had not been intrustedwith the secret; and they were all put to death with torture. Thisattempt having miscarried, another hope was immediately raised. OneDamippus, a Lacedaemonian, who had been sent from Syracuse to kingPhilip, had been taken prisoner by the Roman fleet. Epicydes wasparticularly anxious to ransom this man above any other; nor wasMarcellus disinclined to grant it; the Romans, even at this time,being desirous of gaining the friendship of the Aetolians, with whomthe Lacedaemonians were in alliance. Some persons having been sent totreat respecting his ransom, the most central and convenient place toboth parties for this purpose appeared to be at the Trogilian port,near the tower called Galeagra. As they went there several times, oneof the Romans, having a near view of the wall, and having determinedits height, as nearly as it could be done by conjecture, from countingthe stones, and by forming an estimate, in his own mind, what was theheight of each stone in the face of the work; and having come to theconclusion that it was considerably lower than he himself and all therest had supposed it, and that it was capable of being scaled withladders of moderate size, laid the matter before Marcellus. Itappeared a thing not to be neglected; but as the spot could not beapproached, being on this very account guarded with extraordinarycare, a favourable opportunity of doing it was sought for. This adeserter suggested, who brought intelligence that the Syracusans werecelebrating the festival of Diana; that it was to last three days, andthat as there was a deficiency of other things during the siege, thefeasts would be more profusely celebrated with wine, which wasfurnished by Epicydes to the people in general, and distributedthrough the tribes by persons of distinction. When Marcellus hadreceived this intelligence, he communicated it to a few of themilitary tribunes; then having selected, through their means, suchcenturions and soldiers as had courage and energy enough for soimportant an enterprise, and having privately gotten together a numberof scaling-ladders, he directed that a signal should be given to therest of the troops to take their refreshment, and go to rest early,for they were to go upon an expedition that night. Then the time, asit was supposed, having arrived, when, after having feasted from themiddle of the day, they would have had their fill of wine, and havebegun to sleep, he ordered the soldiers of one company to proceed withthe ladders, while about a thousand armed men were in silence marchedto the spot in a slender column. The foremost having mounted the wall,without noise or confusion, the others followed in order; the boldnessof the former inspiring even the irresolute with courage."Book 25,Chapter 24,"The thousand armed men had now taken a part of the city, when therest, applying a greater number of ladders, mounted the wall on asignal given from the Hexapylos. To this place the former party hadarrived in entire solitude; as the greater part of them, havingfeasted in the towers, were either asleep from the effects of wine, orelse, half asleep, were still drinking. A few of them, however, theysurprised in their beds, and put to the sword. They began then tobreak open a postern gate near the Hexapylos, which required greatforce; and a signal was given from the wall by sounding a trumpet, ashad been agreed upon. After this, the attack was carried on in everyquarter, not secretly, but by open force; for they had now reachedEpipolae, a place protected by numerous guards, where the business wasto terrify the enemy, and not to escape their notice. In effect theywere terrified; for as soon as the sound of the trumpets was heard,and the shouts of the men who had got possession of the walls and apart of the city, the guards concluded that every part was taken, andsome of them fled along the wall, others leaped down from it, or werethrown down headlong by a crowd of the terrified townsmen. A greatpart of the inhabitants, however, were ignorant of this disastrousevent, all of them being overpowered with wine and sleep; and because,in a city of so wide extent, what was perceived in one quarter was notreadily made known through the whole city. A little before day,Marcellus having entered the city with all his forces, through theHexapylos, which was forced open roused all the townsmen; who ran toarms, in order, if possible, by their efforts, to afford succour tothe city, which was now almost taken. Epicydes advanced with a body oftroops at a rapid pace from the Insula, which the Syracusansthemselves call Nasos, not doubting but that he should be able todrive out what he supposed a small party, which had got over the wallthrough the negligence of the guards. He earnestly represented to theterrified inhabitants who met him, that they were increasing theconfusion, and that in their accounts they made things greater andmore important than they really were. But when he perceived that everyplace around Epipolae was filled with armed men, after just teasingthe enemy with the discharge of a few missiles, he marched back to theAchradina, not so much through fear of the number and strength of theenemy, as that some intestine treachery might show itself, takingadvantage of the opportunity, and he might find the gates of theAchradina and island closed upon him in the confusion. When Marcellus,having entered the walls, beheld this city as it lay subjected to hisview from the high ground on which he stood, a city the mostbeautiful, perhaps, of any at that time, he is said to have shed tearsover it; partly from the inward satisfaction he felt at havingaccomplished so important an enterprise, and partly in considerationof its ancient renown. The fleets of the Athenians sunk there, and twovast armies destroyed, with two generals of the highest reputation, aswell as the many wars waged with the Carthaginians with so much perilarose before his mind; the many and powerful tyrants and kings; butabove all Hiero, a king who was not only fresh in his memory, but whowas distinguished for the signal services he had rendered the Romanpeople, and more than all by the endowments which his own virtues andgood fortune had conferred. All these considerations presentingthemselves at once to his recollection, and reflecting, that in aninstant every thing before him would be in flames, and reduced toashes; before he marched his troops to the Achradina, he sent beforehim some Syracusans, who, as was before observed, were among the Romantroops, to induce the enemy, by a persuasive address, to surrender thecity."Book 25,Chapter 25,"The gates and walls of the Achradina were occupied principally bydeserters, who had no hopes of pardon in case of capitulation. Thesemen would neither suffer those who were sent to approach the walls,nor to address them. Marcellus, therefore, on the failure of thisattempt, gave orders to retire to the Euryalus, which is an eminenceat the extremity of the city, at the farthest point from the sea, andcommanding the road leading into the fields and the interior of theisland, and is conveniently situated for the introduction of supplies.This fort was commanded by Philodemus, an Argive, who was placed inthis situation by Epicydes. Marcellus sent Sosis, one of theregicides, to him. After a long conversation, being put off for thepurpose of frustrating him, he brought back word to Marcellus, thatPhilodemus had taken time to deliberate. This man postponing hisanswer day after day, till Hippocrates and Himilco should quit theirpresent position, and come up with their legions; not doubting butthat if he should receive them into the fort, the Roman army, shut upas it was within the walls, might be annihilated, Marcellus, who sawthat the Euryalus would neither be delivered up to him, nor could betaken by force, pitched his camp between Neapolis and Tycha, which arenames of divisions of the city, and are in themselves like cities;fearful lest if he entered populous parts of the city, he should notbe able to restrain his soldiers, greedy of plunder, from running upand down after it. When three ambassadors came to him from Tycha andNeapolis with fillets and other badges of supplicants, imploring himto abstain from fire and slaughter, Marcellus, having held a councilrespecting these entreaties, for so they were, rather than demands,ordered his soldiers, according to the unanimous opinion of thecouncil, not to offer violence to any free person, but told them thatevery thing else might be their booty. The walls of the houses forminga protection for his camp, he posted guards and parties of troops atthe gates, which were exposed, as they faced the streets, lest anyattack should be made upon his camp while the soldiers were dispersedin pursuit of plunder. After these arrangements, on a signal given,the soldiers dispersed for that purpose; and though they broke opendoors and every place resounded in consequence of the alarm andconfusion created, they nevertheless refrained from blood. They didnot desist from plunder till they had gutted the houses of all theproperty which had been accumulated during a long period ofprosperity. Meanwhile, Philodemus also, who despaired of obtainingassistance, having received a pledge that he might return to Epicydesin safety, withdrew the garrison, and delivered up the fortress to theRomans. While the attention of all was engaged by the tumultoccasioned in that part of the city which was captured, Bomilcar,taking advantage of the night, when, from the violence of the weatherthe Roman fleet was unable to ride at anchor in the deep, set out fromthe bay of Syracuse, with thirty-five ships, and sailed away into themain without interruption; leaving fifty-five ships for Epicydes andthe Syracusans; and having informed the Carthaginians in what acritical situation Syracuse was placed, returned, after a few days,with a hundred ships; having, as report says, received many presentsfrom Epicydes out of the treasure of Hiero."Book 25,Chapter 26,"Marcellus, by gaining possession of the Euryalus, and placing agarrison in it, was freed from one cause of anxiety; which was, lestany hostile force received into that fortress on his rear might annoyhis troops, shut up and confined as they were within the walls. Henext invested the Achradina, erecting three camps in convenientsituations, with the hope of reducing those enclosed within it to thewant of every necessary. The outposts of both sides had remainedinactive for several days, when the arrival of Hippocrates and Himilcosuddenly caused the Romans to be attacked aggressively on all sides;for Hippocrates, having fortified a camp at the great harbour, andgiven a signal to those who occupied the Achradina, attacked the oldcamp of the Romans, in which Crispinus had the command; and Epicydessallied out against the outposts of Marcellus, the Carthaginian fleetcoming up to that part of the shore which lay between the city and theRoman camp, so that no succour could be sent by Marcellus toCrispinus. The enemy, however, produced more tumult than conflict; forCrispinus not only drove back Hippocrates from his works, but pursuedhim as he fled with precipitation, while Marcellus drove Epicydes intothe city; and it was considered that enough was now done even toprevent any danger arising in future from their sudden sallies. Theywere visited too by a plague; a calamity extending to both sides, andone which might well divert their attention from schemes of war. Foras the season of the year was autumn, and the situation naturallyunwholesome, though this was much more the case without than withinthe city, the intolerable intensity of the heat had an effect upon theconstitution of almost every man in both the camps. At first theysickened and died from the unhealthiness of the season and climate;but afterwards the disease was spread merely by attending upon, andcoming in contact with, those affected; so that those who were seizedwith it either perished neglected and deserted, or else drew with themthose who sat by them and attended them, by infecting them with thesame violence of disease. Daily funerals and death were before theeye; and lamentations were heard from all sides, day and night. Atlast, their feelings had become so completely brutalized by beinghabituated to these miseries, that they not only did not follow theirdead with tears and decent lamentations, but they did not even carrythem out and bury them; so that the bodies of the dead lay strewedabout, exposed to the view of those who were awaiting a similar fate;and thus the dead were the means of destroying the sick, and the sickthose who were in health, both by fear and by the filthy state and thenoisome stench of their bodies. Some preferring to die by the sword,even rushed alone upon the outposts of the enemy. The violence of theplague, however, was much greater in the Carthaginian than the Romanarmy; for the latter, from having been a long time before Syracuse,had become more habituated to the climate and the water. Of the armyof the enemy, the Sicilians, as soon as they perceived that diseaseshad become very common from the unwholesomeness of the situation,dispersed to their respective cities in the neighbourhood; but theCarthaginians, who had no place to retire to, perished, together withtheir generals, Hippocrates and Himilco, to a man. Marcellus, onseeing the violence with which the disease was raging, had removed histroops into the city, where their debilitated frames were recruited inhouses and shade. Many however, of the Roman army were cut off by thispestilence."Book 25,Chapter 27,"The land forces of the Carthaginians being thus destroyed, theSicilians, who had served under Hippocrates retired to two towns of nogreat size, but well secured by natural situation and fortifications;one was three miles, the other fifteen, from Syracuse. Here theycollected a store of provisions from their own states, and sent forreinforcements. Meanwhile, Bomilcar, who had gone a second time toCarthage, by so stating the condition of their allies as to inspire ahope that they might not only render them effectual aid, but also thatthe Romans might in a manner be made prisoners in the city which theyhad captured, induced the Carthaginians to send with him as many shipsof burden as possible, laden with every kind of provisions, and toaugment the number of his ships. Setting sail, therefore, fromCarthage with a hundred and thirty men of war and seven hundredtransports, he had tolerably fair winds for crossing over to Sicily,but was prevented by the same wind from doubling Cape Pachynum. Thenews of the approach of Bomilcar, and afterwards his unexpected delay,excited alternate fear and joy in the Romans and Syracusans. Epicydes,apprehensive lest if the same wind which now detained him shouldcontinue to blow from the east for several days, the Carthaginianfleet would return to Africa, put the Achradina in the hands of thegenerals of the mercenary troops, and sailed to Bomilcar; whom he atlength prevailed upon to try the issue of a naval battle, though hefound him with his fleet stationed in the direction of Africa, andafraid of fighting, not so much because he was unequal in the strengthor the number of his ships, for he had more than the Romans, asbecause the wind was more favourable to the Roman fleet than to hisown. Marcellus also seeing that an army of Sicilians was assemblingfrom every part of the island, and that the Carthaginian fleet wasapproaching with a great want of supplies, though inferior in thenumber of his ships, resolved to prevent Bomilcar from coming toSyracuse, lest, blocked up in the city of his enemies, he should bepressed both by sea and land. The two hostile fleets were stationednear the promontory of Pachynum, ready to engage as soon as the seashould become calm enough to admit of their sailing out into the deep.Accordingly, the east wind, which had blown violently for severaldays, now subsiding, Bomilcar got under sail first, his van seeming tomake for the main sea, in order to double the promontory with greaterease; but seeing the Roman ships bearing down upon him, terrified bysome unexpected occurrence, it is not known what, he sailed away intothe main sea; and sending messengers to Heraclea, to order thetransports to return to Africa, he passed along the coast of Sicilyand made for Tarentum. Epicydes, thus suddenly disappointed in suchgreat expectations, to avoid returning to endeavour to raise the siegeof a city, a great part of which was already in the hands of theenemy, sailed to Agrigentum, intending to wait the issue of thecontest, rather than take any new measures when there."Book 25,Chapter 28,"Intelligence of these events having been carried into the camp ofthe Sicilians, that Epicydes had departed from Syracuse, that theisland was deserted by the Carthaginians, and almost again deliveredup to the Romans; after sounding the inclinations of the besieged inconferences, they sent ambassadors to Marcellus, to treat about termsof capitulation. They had not much difficulty in coming to anagreement, that all the parts of the island which had been under thedominion of their kings should be ceded to the Romans; that the rest,with their liberty and their own laws, should be preserved to theSicilians. They then invited to a conference the persons who had beenintrusted with the management of affairs by Epicydes; to whom theysaid, that they were sent from the army of the Sicilians, at once toMarcellus and to them, that both those who were besieged and those whowere not might share the same fortune; and that neither of them mightstipulate any thing for themselves separately. They were then allowedto enter, in order to converse with their relations and friends; when,laying before them the terms which they had made with Marcellus, andholding out to them a hope of safety, they induced them to join withthem in an attack upon the prefects of Epicydes, Polyclitus,Philistion, and Epicydes, surnamed Sindon. Having put them to death,they summoned the multitude to an assembly; and after complaining ofthe famine, at which they had been accustomed to express theirdissatisfaction to each other in secret, they said, that ""althoughthey were pressed by so many calamities, they had no right to accuseFortune, because it was at their own option how long they shouldcontinue to suffer them. That the motive which the Romans had inbesieging Syracuse was affection for the Syracusans, and not hatred;for when they heard that the government was usurped by Hippocrates andEpicydes, the creatures first of Hannibal and then of Hieronymus, theytook arms and began to besiege the city, in order to reduce not thecity itself, but its cruel tyrants. But now that Hippocrates is slain,Epicydes shut out of Syracuse, his praefects put to death, and theCarthaginians driven from the entire possession of Sicily by sea andland, what reason can the Romans have left why they should not desirethe preservation of Syracuse, in the same manner as they would ifHiero were still lining, who cultivated the friendship of Rome withunequalled fidelity? That, therefore, neither the city nor itsinhabitants were in any danger, except from themselves, if theyneglected an opportunity of restoring themselves to the favour of theRomans; and that no so favourable a one would ever occur as that whichpresented itself at the present instant, immediately upon itsappearing that they were delivered from their insolent tyrants."""Book 25,Chapter 29,"This speech was received with the most unqualified approbation ofall present. It was resolved, however, that praetors should be electedbefore the nomination of deputies; which being done, some of thepraetors themselves were sent as deputies to Marcellus, the chief ofwhom thus addressed him: ""Neither in the first instance did weSyracusans revolt from you, but Hieronymus, whose impiety towards youwas by no means so great as towards us; nor afterwards was it anySyracusan who disturbed the peace established by the death of thetyrant, but Hippocrates and Epicydes, creatures of the tyrant; whilewe were overpowered, on the one hand by fear, and on the other bytreachery. Nor can any one say that there ever was a time when we werein possession of our liberty, when we were not also at peace with you.In the present instance, manifestly, as soon as ever we became our ownmasters, by the death of those persons who held Syracuse insubjection, we lost no time in coming to deliver up our arms, tosurrender ourselves, our city, and our walls, and to refuse noconditions which you shall impose upon us. To you, Marcellus, the godshave given the glory of having captured the most renowned andbeautiful of the Grecian cities. Every memorable exploit which we haveat any time achieved by land or sea accrues to the splendour of yourtriumph. Would you wish that it should be known only by fame, howgreat a city has been captured by you, rather than that she shouldstand as a monument even to posterity; so that to every one who visitsher by sea or land, she may point out at one time our trophies gainedfrom the Athenians and Carthaginians, at another time those which youhave gained from us; and that you should transmit Syracuse unimpairedto your family, to be kept under the protection and patronage of therace of the Marcelli? Let not the memory of Hieronymus have greaterweight with you than that of Hiero. The latter was your friend for amuch longer period than the former was your enemy. From the latter youhave realized even benefits, while the frenzy of Hieronymus onlybrought ruin upon himself."" At the hands of the Romans all things wereobtainable and secure. There was a greater disposition to war, andmore danger to be apprehended among themselves; for the deserters,thinking that they were delivered up to the Romans, induced themercenary auxiliaries to entertain the same apprehension; and hastilyseizing their arms, they first put the praetors to death, and then ranthrough the city to massacre the Syracusans. In their rage they slewall whom chance threw in their way, and plundered every thing whichpresented itself; and then, lest they should have no leaders, theyelected six praetors, so that three might have the command in theAchradina, and three in the island. At length, the tumult havingsubsided, and the mercenary troops having ascertained, by inquiry,what had been negotiated with the Romans, it began to appear, as wasreally the case, that their cause and that of the deserters weredifferent."Book 25,Chapter 30,"The ambassadors returned from Marcellus very opportunely. Theyinformed them that they had been influenced by groundless suspicions,and that the Romans saw no reason why they should inflict punishmentupon them. Of the three praefects of the Achradina one was a Spaniard,named Mericus. To him one of the Spanish auxiliaries was designedlysent, among those who accompanied the ambassadors. Having obtained aninterview with Mericus in the absence of witnesses, he first explainedto him the state in which he had left Spain, from which he had latelyreturned: ""That there every thing was in subjection to the Roman arms;that it was in his power, by doing the Romans a service, to become thefirst man among his countrymen, whether he might be inclined to servewith the Romans, or to return to his country. On the other hand, if hepersisted in preferring to hold out against the siege, what hope couldhe have, shut up as he was by sea and land?"" Mericus was moved bythese suggestions, and when it was resolved upon to send ambassadorsto Marcellus, he sent his brother among them; who, being brought intothe presence of Marcellus, apart from the rest, by means of the sameSpaniard, after receiving an assurance of protection, arranged themethod of carrying their object into effect, and then returned to theAchradina. Mericus then, in order to prevent any one from conceiving asuspicion of treachery, declared, that he did not like that deputiesshould be passing to and fro; he thought that they should neitheradmit nor send any; and in order that the guards might be kept morestrictly, that such parts as were most exposed should be distributedamong the prefects, each being made responsible for the safety of hisown quarter. All approved of the distribution of the posts. Thedistrict which fell to the lot of Mericus himself extended from thefountain Arethusa to the mouth of the large harbour, of which hecaused the Romans to be informed. Accordingly, Marcellus ordered atransport with armed men to be towed by a quadrireme to the Achradinaduring the night, and the soldiers to be landed in the vicinity ofthat gate which is near the fountain of Arethusa. This order havingbeen executed at the fourth watch, and Mericus having received thesoldiers when landed at the gate, according to the agreement,Marcellus assaulted the walls of the Achradina with all his forces atbreak of day, so that he not only engaged the attention of those whooccupied the Achradina, but also bands of armed men, quitting theirown posts ran to the spot from the island, in order to repel thefurious attack of the Romans. During this confusion, some light shipswhich had been prepared beforehand, and had sailed round, landed abody of armed men at the island; these suddenly attacking thehalf-manned stations and the opened door of the gate at which thetroops had a little before run out, got possession of the islandwithout much opposition, abandoned as it was, in consequence of theflight and trepidation of its guards. Nor were there any who renderedless service, or showed less firmness in maintaining their posts, thanthe deserters; for as they did not repose much confidence even inthose of their own party, they fled in the middle of the contest. WhenMarcellus learnt that the island was taken, one quarter of theAchradina in the hands of his troops, and that Mericus, with the menunder his command, had joined them, he sounded a retreat, lest theroyal treasure, the fame of which was greater than the reality, shouldbe plundered."Book 25,Chapter 31,"The impetuosity of the soldiers having been checked, time andopportunity to escape were given to the deserters in the Achradina;and the Syracusans, at length delivered from their fears, threw openthe gates of the Achradina, and sent deputies to Marcellus, requestingonly safety for themselves and children. Having summoned a council, towhich the Syracusans were invited who were among the Roman troops,having been driven from home during the disturbances, Marcellusreplied, ""that the services rendered by Hiero through a period offifty years, were not more in number than the injuries committedagainst the Roman people in these few years by those who had hadpossession of Syracuse; but that most of these injuries had justlyrecoiled upon their authors, and that they had inflicted much moresevere punishment upon themselves for the violation of treaties, thanthe Roman people desired. That he was indeed now besieging Syracusefor the third year, but not that the Romans might hold that state in acondition of slavery, but that the ringleaders of the deserters mightnot keep it in a state of thraldom and oppression. What the Syracusanscould do was exemplified, either by the conduct of those Syracusanswho were among the Roman troops, or that of the Spanish general,Mericus, who had delivered up the post which he was appointed tocommand, or, lastly, by the late but bold measure adopted by theSyracusans themselves. That the greatest possible recompence for allthe evils and dangers which he had for so long a time undergone, bothby sea and land, around the walls of Syracuse, was the reflection,that he had been able to take that city."" The quaestor was then sentwith a guard to the island, to receive and protect the royal treasure.The city was given up to be plundered by the soldiery, after guardshad been placed at each of the houses of those who had been with theRoman troops. While many acts exhibited horrid examples of rage andrapacity, it is recorded that Archimedes, while intent on some figureswhich he had described in the dust, although the confusion was asgreat as could possibly exist in a captured city, in which soldierswere running up and down in search of plunder, was put to death by asoldier, who did not know who he was; that Marcellus was grieved atthis event, and that pains were taken about his funeral, while hisrelations also for whom diligent inquiry was made, derived honour andprotection from his name and memory. Such, for the most part, was themanner in which Syracuse was captured. The quantity of booty was sogreat, that had Carthage itself, which was carrying on a contest onequal terms, been captured, it would scarcely have afforded so much. Afew days before the taking of Syracuse, Titus Otacilius passed overfrom Lilybaeum to Utica with eighty quinqueremes, and entering theharbour before it was light, took some transports laden with corn;then landing, he laid waste a considerable portion of the countryaround Utica, and brought back to his ships booty of everydescription. He returned to Lilybaeum, the third day after he set out,with a hundred and thirty transports laden with corn and booty. Thecorn he sent immediately to Syracuse; and had it not been for the veryseasonable arrival of this supply, a destructive famine threatenedalike the victors and the vanquished."Book 25,Chapter 32,"Nothing very memorable had been done in Spain for about two years,the operations of the war consisting more in laying plans than infighting; but during the same summer in which the events aboverecorded took place, the Roman generals, quitting their winterquarters, united their forces; then a council was summoned; and theopinions of all accorded, that since their only object hitherto hadbeen to prevent Hasdrubal from pursuing his march into Italy, it wasnow time that an effort should be made to bring the war in Spain to atermination; and they thought that the twenty thousand Celtiberians,who had been induced to take arms that winter, formed a sufficientaccession to their strength. There were three armies of the enemy.Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, and Mago, who had united their forces, wereabout a five days' journey from the Romans. Hasdrubal, son ofHamilcar, who was the old commander in Spain, was nearer to them: hewas with his army near the city Anitorgis. The Roman generals weredesirous that he should be overpowered first; and they hoped that theyhad enough and more than enough strength for the purpose. Their onlysource of anxiety was, lest the other Hasdrubal and Mago, terrified athis discomfiture, should protract the war by withdrawing intotrackless forests and mountains. Thinking it, therefore, the wisestcourse to divide their forces and embrace the whole Spanish war, theyarranged it so that Publius Cornelius should lead two-thirds of theRoman and allied troops against Mago and Hasdrubal, and that CneiusCornelius, with the remaining third of the original army, and with theCeltiberians added to them, should carry on the war with the BarcineHasdrubal. The two generals and their armies, setting out together,preceded by the Celtiberians, pitched their camp near the cityAnitorgis, within sight of the enemy, the river only separating them.Here Cneius Scipio, with the forces above mentioned, halted, butPublius Scipio proceeded to the portion of the war assigned to him."Book 25,Chapter 33,"Hasdrubal perceiving that there were but few Roman troops in thecamp, and that their whole dependence was on the Celtiberianauxiliaries; and having had experience of the perfidy of the barbariannations in general, and particularly of all those nations among whichhe had served for so many years; as there was every facility ofintercourse, for both camps were full of Spaniards, by secretconferences with the chiefs of the Celtiberians, he agreed with them,for a large consideration, to take their forces away. Nor did theyconceive it to be any great crime; for the object was not that theyshould turn their arms against the Romans, while the reward which theywere to receive to abstain from the war was large enough to remuneratethem for their service in it. At the same time the mere rest fromlabour, the return to their homes, with the pleasure of seeing theirfriends and property, were pleasing to the generality. Accordingly,the multitude were prevailed upon as easily as their leaders. Theyhad, moreover, nothing to fear from the Romans, in consequence of thesmallness of their numbers, should they endeavour to detain them byforce. It will indeed be the duty of all Roman generals to take care,and the instances here recorded should be considered as strongarguments, never to place so much confidence in foreign auxiliaries,as not to retain in their camps a preponderance of their own strengthand of that force which is properly their own. The Celtiberians,suddenly taking up their standards, marched away, replying only to theRomans, who asked the cause of their departure and entreated them tostay, that they were called away by a war at home. Scipio seeing thathis allies could be detained neither by prayers nor force, and that hewas neither a match for his enemy without them, nor could again effecta junction with his brother, no other course which promised safetyoffering itself, resolved to retire as far as possible, carefullyusing every caution not to encounter the enemy any where on levelground. On his departing, the enemy, crossing the river, pursued himalmost in his footsteps."Book 25,Chapter 34,"During the same period an equal terror and a greater dangerpressed upon Publius Scipio. Masinissa was a young man at that time anally of the Carthaginians, whom afterwards the friendship of theRomans rendered illustrious and powerful. He not only opposed himselfwith his Numidian cavalry to Scipio on his approach, but afterwardsharassed him incessantly day and night, so as both to cut off hisstragglers, who had gone out to a distance from the camp in search ofwood and forage, and riding up to the very gates of his camp, andcharging into the midst of his advanced guards, to fill every quarterwith the utmost confusion. By night also alarm was frequentlyoccasioned in the gates and rampart by his sudden attacks. Nor wasthere any time or place at which the Romans were exempt from fear andanxiety; and driven within their rampart, and deprived of everynecessary, they suffered in a manner a regular siege; and it appearedthat it would have been still straiter, if Indibilis, who it wasreported was approaching with seven thousand five hundred Suessetani,should form a junction with the Carthaginians. Scipio, though a waryand provident general, overpowered by difficulties, adopted the rashmeasure of going to meet Indibilis by night, with the intention offighting him wherever he should meet him. Leaving, therefore, a smallforce in his camp, under the command of Titus Fonteius,lieutenant-general, he set out at midnight, and meeting with theenemy, came to battle with him. The troops fought in the order ofmarch rather than of battle. The Romans, however, had the advantage,though in an irregular fight; but the Numidian cavalry, whoseobservation the general supposed that he had escaped, suddenlyspreading themselves round his flanks, occasioned great terror. Aftera new contest had been entered into with the Numidians, a third enemycame up in addition to the rest, the Carthaginian generals having comeup with their rear when they were now engaged in fighting. Thus theRomans were surrounded on every side by enemies; nor could they makeup their minds which they should attack first, or in what part,forming themselves into a close body, they should force their waythrough. The general, while fighting and encouraging his men, exposinghimself wherever the strife was the hottest, was run through the rightside with a lance; and when the party of the enemy, which, formed intoa wedge, had charged the troops collected round the general, perceivedScipio falling lifeless from his horse, elated with joy, they ranshouting through the whole line with the news that the Roman generalhad fallen. These words spreading in every direction, caused the enemyto be considered as victors, and the Romans as vanquished. On the lossof the general the troops immediately began to fly from the field; butthough it was not difficult to force their way through the Numidiansand the other light-armed auxiliaries, yet it was scarcely possiblefor them to escape so large a body of cavalry, and infantry equal tohorses in speed. Almost more were slain in the flight than in thebattle; nor would a man have survived, had not night put a stop to thecarnage, the day by this time rapidly drawing to a close."Book 25,Chapter 35,"After this, the Carthaginian generals, who were not slow infollowing up their victory, immediately after the battle, scarcelygiving their soldiers necessary rest, hurry their army to Hasdrubal,son of Hamilcar; confidently hoping, that after uniting their forceswith his, the war might be brought to a conclusion. On their arrival,the warmest congratulations passed between the troops and theirgenerals, who were delighted with their recent victory; for they hadnot only destroyed one distinguished general and all his men, butlooked forward to another victory of equal magnitude as a matter ofcertainty. The intelligence of this great disaster had not yet reachedthe Romans; but there prevailed a kind of melancholy silence and muteforeboding, such as is usually found in minds which have apresentiment of impending calamity. The general himself, besidesfeeling that he was deserted by his allies, and that the forces of theenemy were so much augmented, was disposed from conjecture andreasoning rather to a suspicion that some defeat had been sustained,than to any favourable hopes. ""For how could Hasdrubal and Mago bringup their troops without opposition, unless they had terminated theirpart of the war? How was it that his brother had not opposed hisprogress or followed on his rear? in order that if he could notprevent the armies and generals of the enemy from forming a junction,he might himself join his forces with his brother's."" Disturbed withthese cares, he believed that the only safe policy for the present wasto retire as far as possible; and, accordingly, he marched aconsiderable distance thence in one night, the enemy not being awareof it, and on that account continuing quiet. At dawn, perceiving thattheir enemy had decamped, they sent the Numidians in advance, andbegan to pursue them as rapidly as possible. The Numidians overtookthem before night, and charged; sometimes their rear, at other timestheir flanks. They then began to halt and defend themselves as well asthey could; but Scipio exhorted them at once to fight so as not toexpose themselves, and march at the same time, lest the infantryshould overtake them."Book 25,Chapter 36,"But having made but little progress for a long time, inconsequence of his making his troops sometimes advance and at othershalt, and night now drawing on, Scipio recalled his troops from thebattle, and collecting them, withdrew to a certain eminence, not verysafe, indeed, particularly for dispirited troops, but higher than anyof the surrounding places. There, at first, his infantry, drawn uparound his baggage and cavalry, which were placed in their centre, hadno difficulty in repelling the attacks of the charging Numidians; butafterwards, when three generals with three regular armies marched upin one entire body, and it was evident that his men would not be ableto do much by arms in defending the position without fortifications,the general began to look about, and consider whether he could by anymeans throw a rampart around; but the hill was so bare, and the soilso rough, that neither could a bush be found for cutting a palisade,nor earth for making a mound, nor the requisites for making a trenchor any other work; nor was the place naturally steep or abrupt enoughto render the approach and ascent difficult to the enemy, as it roseon every side with a gentle acclivity. However, that they might raiseup against them some semblance of a rampart, they placed around themthe panniers tied to the burdens, building them up as it were to theusual height, and when there was a deficiency of panniers for raisingit, they presented against the enemy a heap of baggage of every kind.The Carthaginian armies coming up, very easily marched up theeminence, but were stopped by the novel appearance of thefortification, as by something miraculous, when their leaders calledout from all sides, asking ""what they stopped at? and why they did nottear down and demolish that mockery, which was scarcely strong enoughto impede the progress of women and children; that the enemy, who wereskulking behind their baggage, were, in fact, captured and in theirhands."" Such were the contemptuous reproofs of their leaders. But itwas not an easy task either to leap over or remove the burdens raisedup against them, or to cut through the panniers, closely packedtogether and covered completely with baggage. When the removal of theburdens had opened a way to the troops, who were detained by them fora long time, and the same had been done in several quarters, the campwas now captured on all sides; the Romans were cut to pieces on allhands, the few by the many, the dispirited by the victorious. A greatnumber of the men, however, having fled for refuge into theneighbouring woods, effected their escape to the camp of PubliusScipio, which Titus Fonteius commanded. Some authors relate thatCneius Scipio was slain on the eminence on the first assault of theenemy; others that he escaped with a few attendants to a castle nearthe camp; this, they say, was surrounded with fire, by which means thedoors which they could not force were consumed; that it was thustaken, and all within, together with the general himself, put todeath. Cneius Scipio was slain in the eighth year after his arrival inSpain, and on the twenty-ninth day after the death of his brother. AtRome the grief occasioned by their death was not more intense thanthat which was felt throughout Spain. The sorrow of the citizens,however, was partly distracted by the loss of the armies, thealienation of the province, and the public disaster, while in Spainthey mourned and regretted the generals themselves, Cneius, however,the more, because he had been longer in command of them, had firstengaged their affections, and first exhibited a specimen of Romanjustice and forbearance."Book 25,Chapter 37,"When it seemed that the Roman armies were annihilated, and Spainlost, one man recovered this desperate state of affairs. There was inthe army one Lucius Marcius, the son of Septimus, a Roman knight, anenterprising youth, and possessing a mind and genius far superior tothe condition in which he had been born. To his high talents had beenadded the discipline of Cneius Scipio, under which he had beenthoroughly instructed during a course of so many years in all thequalifications of a soldier. This man, having collected the troopswhich had been dispersed in the flight, and drafted some from thegarrisons, had formed an army not to be despised, and united it withTitus Tonteius, the lieutenant-general of Publius Scipio. But sotranscendent was the Roman knight in authority and honour among thetroops, that when, after fortifying a camp on this side of the Iberus,it had been resolved that a general of the two armies should beelected in an assembly of the soldiers, relieving each other in theguard of the rampart, and in keeping the outposts until every one hadgiven his vote, they unanimously conferred the supreme command uponLucius Marcius. All the intervening time, which was but short, wasoccupied in fortifying their camp and collecting provisions, and thesoldiers executed every order not only with vigour, but with feelingsby no means depressed. But when intelligence was brought them thatHasdrubal, son of Gisgo, who was coming to put the finishing stroke tothe war, had crossed the Iberus and was drawing near, and when theysaw the signal for battle displayed by a new commander, then callingto mind whom they had had for their leaders a little while ago,relying on what leaders and what forces they used to go out to fight,they all suddenly burst into tears and beat their heads, some raisingtheir hands to heaven and arraigning the gods, others prostratingthemselves upon the ground and invoking by name each his own formercommander. Nor could their lamentations be restrained, though thecenturions endeavoured to animate their companies, and though Marciushimself soothed and remonstrated with them, asking them ""why they hadgiven themselves up to womanish and unavailing lamentations ratherthan summon up all their courage to protect themselves and thecommonwealth together, and not suffer their generals to lieunavenged?"" But suddenly a shout and the sound of trumpets were heard;for by this time the enemy were near the rampart. Upon this, theirgrief being suddenly converted into rage, they hastily ran to arms,and, as it were, burning with fury, rushed to the gates and chargedthe enemy, while advancing in a careless and disorderly manner. Thisunexpected event instantly struck terror into the Carthaginians, whowondering whence so many enemies could have sprung up so suddenly, asthe army had been almost annihilated; what could have inspired men whohad been vanquished and routed with such boldness and confidence inthemselves; what general could have arisen now that the two Scipioswere slain; who could command the camp, and who had given the signalfor battle; in consequence of these so many and so unexpectedcircumstances, at first, being in a state of complete uncertainty andamazement, they gave ground; but afterwards, discomfited by theviolence of the charge, they turned their backs; and either therewould have been a dreadful slaughter of the flying enemy, or a rashand dangerous effort on the part of the pursuers, had not Marciuspromptly given the signal for retreat, and by throwing himself in theway of the front rank, and even holding some back with his own hands,repressed the infuriated troops. He then led them back to the camp,still eager for blood and slaughter. When the Carthaginians, who wereat first compelled to fly with precipitation from the rampart of theirenemy, saw that no one pursued them, concluding that they had stoppedfrom fear, now on the other hand went away to their camp at an easypace, with feelings of contempt for the enemy. There was acorresponding want of care in guarding their camp; for though theenemy were near, yet it seemed that they were but the remains of thetwo armies which had been cut to pieces a few days before. As inconsequence of this all things were neglected in the enemy's camp,Marcius having ascertained this, addressed his mind to a measure whichon the first view of it might appear rather rash than bold: it was,aggressively to assault the enemy's camp, concluding that the camp ofHasdrubal, while alone, might be carried with less difficulty than hisown could be defended, if the three armies and as many generals shouldagain unite; taking into consideration also that either if hesucceeded he would retrieve their prostrate fortune, or if repulsed,still, by making the attack himself, he would rescue himself fromcontempt."Book 25,Chapter 38,"Lest, however, the suddenness of the affair, and the fear ofnight, should frustrate a measure which was in itself ill adapted tohis condition, he thought it right that his soldiers should beaddressed and exhorted; and having called an assembly, he discoursedas follows: ""Soldiers, either my veneration for our late commanders,both living and dead, or our present situation, may impress on everyone the belief that this command, as it is highly honourable to me,conferred by your suffrages, so is it in its nature a heavy andanxious charge. For at a time when I should be scarcely so far masterof myself as to be able to find any solace for my afflicted mind, didnot fear deaden the sense of sorrow, I am compelled to take uponmyself alone the task of consulting for the good of you all; a task ofthe greatest difficulty when under the influence of grief. And noteven at that critical moment, when I ought to be considering in whatmanner I may be enabled to keep together for my country these remainsof two armies, can I divert my mind from the affliction whichincessantly preys upon me. For bitter recollection is ever present,and the Scipios ever disturb me with anxious cares by day and dreamsby night, frequently rousing me from my sleep, and imploring me not tosuffer themselves nor their soldiers, your companions in war, who hadbeen victorious in this country for eight years, nor the commonwealthto remain unrevenged; enjoining me also to follow their discipline andtheir plans; and desiring that as there was no one more obedient totheir commands while they were alive than I, so after their death Iwould consider that conduct as best, which I might have the strongestreason for believing they would have adopted in each case. I couldwish also that you, my soldiers, should not show your respect for themby lamentations and tears, as if they were dead; (for they still liveand flourish in the fame of their achievements;) but that whenever thememory of those men shall occur to you, you would go into battle asthough you saw them encouraging you and giving you the signal. Norcertainly could anything else than their image presenting itselfyesterday to your eyes and minds, have enabled you to fight thatmemorable battle, in which you proved to the enemy that the Roman namehad not become extinct with the Scipios; and that the energy andvalour of that people, which had not been overwhelmed by the disasterat Cannae, would, doubtlessly, emerge from the severest storms offortune. Now since you have dared so much of your own accord, I have amind to try how much you will dare when authorized by your general:for yesterday, when I gave the signal for retreat while you werepursuing the routed enemy with precipitation, I did not wish to breakyour spirit, but to reserve it for greater glory and more advantageousopportunities; that you might afterwards, when prepared and armed,seize an occasion of attacking your enemy while off their guard,unarmed, and even buried in sleep. Nor do I entertain the hope ofgaining an opportunity of this kind rashly, but from the actual stateof things. Doubtless, if any one should ask even himself, by whatmeans, though few in number and disheartened by defeat, you defendedyour camp against troops superior in number and victorious, you wouldgive no other answer than that, as this was the very thing you wereafraid of, you had kept every place secured by works and yourselvesready and equipped. And so it generally happens: men are least secureagainst that which fortune causes not to be feared; because you leaveunguarded and exposed what you think is not necessary to be caredabout. There is nothing whatever which the enemy fear less at thepresent time, than lest we, who were a little while ago besieged andassaulted, should aggressively assault their camp ourselves. Let usdare, then, to do that which it is incredible we should have thecourage to attempt; it will be most easy from the very fact of itsappearing most difficult. At the third watch of the night I will leadyou thither in silence. I have ascertained by means of scouts thatthey have no regular succession of watches, no proper outposts. Ourshout at their gates, when heard, and the first assault, will carrytheir camp. Then let that carnage be made among men, torpid withsleep, terrified at the unexpected tumult, and overpowered while lyingdefenceless in their beds, from which you were so grieved to berecalled yesterday. I know that the measure appears to you a daringone; but in difficult and almost desperate circumstances the boldestcounsels are always the safest. For if when the critical moment hasarrived, the opportunity of seizing which is of a fleeting nature, youdelay ever so little, in vain do you seek for it afterwards when ithas been neglected. One army is near us; two more are not far off. Wehave some hopes if we make an attack now; and you have already madetrial of your own and their strength. If we postpone the time andcease to be despised in consequence of the fame of yesterday'sirruption, there is danger lest all the generals and all the forcesshould unite. Shall we be able then to withstand three generals andthree armies, whom Cneius Scipio with his army unimpaired could notwithstand? As our generals have perished by dividing their forces, sothe enemy may be overpowered while separated and divided. There is noother mode of maintaining the war; let us, therefore, wait for nothingbut the opportunity of the ensuing night. Now depart, with the favourof the gods, and refresh yourselves, that, unfatigued and vigorous,you may burst into the enemy's camp with the same spirit with whichyou have defended your own."" This new enterprise, proposed by theirnew general, they received with joy; and the more daring it was themore it pleased them. The remainder of the day was spent in gettingtheir arms in readiness and recruiting their strength, the greaterpart of the night was given to rest, and at the fourth watch they werein motion."Book 25,Chapter 39,"At a distance of six miles beyond their nearest camp lay otherforces of the Carthaginians. A deep valley, thickly planted withtrees, intervened. Near about the middle of this wood a Roman cohortand some cavalry were placed in concealment with Punic craft. Thecommunication between the two armies being thus cut off, the rest ofthe forces were marched in silence to the nearest body of the enemy;and as there were no outposts before the gates, and no guards on therampart, they entered quite into the camp, as though it had been theirown, no one any where opposing them. The signals were then sounded anda shout raised. Some put the enemy to the sword when half asleep;others threw fire upon the huts, which were covered in with dry straw;others blocked up the gates to intercept their escape. The enemy, whowere assailed at once with fire, shouting, and the sword, were in amanner bereaved of their senses, and could neither hear each other,nor take any measures for their security. Unarmed, they fell into themidst of troops of armed men: some hastened to the gates; others, asthe passes were flocked up, leaped over the rampart, and as eachescaped they fled directly towards the other camp, where they were cutoff by the cohort and cavalry rushing forward from their concealment,and were all slain to a man. And even had any escaped from thatcarnage, the Romans, after taking the nearer camp, ran over to theother with such rapidity, that no one could have arrived before themwith news of the disaster. In this camp, as they were far distant fromthe enemy, and as some had gone off just before daylight for forage,wood, and plunder, they found every thing in a still more neglectedand careless state. Their arms only were placed at the outposts, themen being unarmed, and either sitting and reclining upon the ground,or else walking up and down before the rampart and the gates. On thesemen, thus at their ease and unguarded, the Romans, still hot from therecent battle, and flushed with victory, commenced an attack; noeffectual opposition therefore could be made to them in the gates.Within the gates, the troops having rushed together from every part ofthe camp at the first shout and alarm, a furious conflict arose; whichwould have continued for a long time, had not the bloody appearance ofthe Roman shields discovered to the Carthaginians the defeat of theother forces, and consequently struck them with dismay. This alarmproduced a general flight; and all except those who were overtakenwith the sword, rushing out precipitately wherever they could find apassage, abandoned their camp. Thus, in a night and a day, two campsof the enemy were carried, under the conduct of Lucius Marcius.Claudius, who translated the annals of Acilius out of Greek intoLatin, states that as many as thirty-seven thousand men were slain,one thousand eight hundred and thirty made prisoners, and a greatbooty obtained; among which was a silver shield of a hundred andthirty-eight pounds' weight, with an image upon it of the BarcineHasdrubal. Valerius Antias states, that the camp Of Mago only wascaptured, and seven thousand of the enemy slain; and that in the otherbattle, when the Romans sallied out and fought with Hasdrubal, tenthousand were slain, and four thousand three hundred captured. Pisowrites, that five thousand were slain in an ambuscade when Magoincautiously pursued our troops who retired. With all, the name of thegeneral, Marcius, is mentioned with great honour, and to his realglory they add even miracles. They say, that while he was haranguinghis men a stream of fire poured from his head without his perceivingit, to the great terror of the surrounding soldiers; and that ashield, called the Marcian, with an image of Hasdrubal upon it,remained in the temple up to the time of the burning of the Capitol, amonument of his victory over the Carthaginians. After this, affairscontinued for a considerable time in a tranquil state in Spain, asboth parties, after giving and receiving such important defeats,hesitated to run the hazard of a general battle."Book 25,Chapter 40,"During these transactions in Spain, Marcellus, after the captureof Syracuse, having settled the other affairs in Sicily with so muchhonour and integrity as not only to add to his own renown, but also tothe majesty of the Roman people, conveyed to Rome the ornaments of thecity, together with the statues and pictures with which Syracuseabounded. These were certainly spoils taken from enemies, and acquiredaccording to the laws of war; but hence was the origin of theadmiration of the products of Grecian art, and to that freedom withwhich at present all places, both sacred and profane, are despoiled;which at last recoiled upon the Roman gods, and first upon that verytemple which was so choicely adorned by Marcellus. For foreigners werein the habit of visiting the temples dedicated by Marcellus near theCapuan gate, on account of their splendid ornaments of thisdescription, of which a very small portion can be found. Embassiesfrom almost all the states of Sicily came to him. As their cases weredifferent, so were also the terms granted to them. Those who hadeither not revolted or had returned to the alliance before the captureof Syracuse, were received and honoured as faithful allies. Those whohad been induced to submit through fear after the capture of Syracuse,as vanquished, received laws from the conqueror. The Romans, however,had still remaining a war of no small magnitude at Agrigentum, headedby Epicydes and Hanno, generals in the late war, and a third new onesent by Hannibal in the room of Hippocrates, a Libyphoenician bynation, and a native of Hippo, called by his countrymen Mutines; anenergetic man, and thoroughly instructed in all the arts of war underthe tuition of Hannibal. To this man the Numidian auxiliaries wereassigned by Epicydes and Hanno. With these he so thoroughly overranthe lands of his enemies, and visited his allies with such activity,in order to retain them in their allegiance, and for the purpose ofbringing them seasonable aid as each required it, that in a short timehe filled all Sicily with his fame, nor was greater confidence placedin any one else by those who favoured the Carthaginian interest.Accordingly the Carthaginian and Syracusan generals, who had beenhitherto compelled to keep within the walls of Agrigentum, not more atthe advice of Mutines than from the confidence they reposed in him,had the courage to go out from the walls, and pitched a camp near theriver Himera. When this was announced to Marcellus, he immediatelyadvanced and sat down at a distance of about four miles from theenemy, with the intention of waiting to see what steps they took, andwhat they meditated. But Mutines allowed no room or time for delay ordeliberation, but crossed the river, and, charging the outposts of hisenemy, created the greatest terror and confusion. The next day, in anengagement which might almost be called regular, he compelled hisenemy to retire within their works. Being called away by a mutiny ofthe Numidians, which had broken out in the camp, and in which aboutthree hundred of them had retired to Heraclea Minoa, he set out toappease them and bring them back; and is said to have earnestly warnedthe generals not to engage with the enemy during his absence. Both thegenerals were indignant at this conduct, but particularly Hanno, whowas before disturbed at his reputation. ""Is it to be borne,"" said he,""that a mongrel African should impose restraints upon me, aCarthaginian general, commissioned by the senate and people?""Epicydes, who wished to wait, was prevailed upon by him to agree totheir crossing the river and offering battle; for, said he, if theyshould wait for Mutines, and the battle should terminate successfully,Mutines would certainly have the credit of it."Book 25,Chapter 41,"But Marcellus, highly indignant that he who had repulsed Hannibalfrom Nola, when rendered confident by his victory at Cannae, shouldsuccumb to enemies whom he had vanquished by sea and land, ordered hissoldiers immediately to take arms and raise the standards. Whilemarshalling his army, ten Numidians rode up rapidly from the enemy'sline with information that their countrymen, first induced by the samecauses which brought on the mutiny, in which three hundred of theirnumber retired to Heraclea, and secondly, because they saw theircommander, just on the approach of a battle, sent out of the way bygenerals who wished to detract from his glory, would not take any partin the battle. This deceitful nation made good their promise in thisinstance. Accordingly the spirits of the Romans were increased by theintelligence, which was speedily conveyed through the lines, that theenemy were abandoned by the cavalry, which the Romans principallyfeared; while at the same time the enemy were dispirited, not onlybecause they were deprived of the principal part of their strength,but further, because they were afraid lest they should themselves beattacked by their own cavalry. Accordingly, there was no greatresistance made: the first shout and onset determined the business.The Numidians who stood quiet in the wings during the action, whenthey saw their party turning their backs, accompanied them in theirflight only for a short time; but when they perceived that they wereall making for Agrigentum with the most violent haste, they turned offto the neighbouring towns round about, through fear of a siege. Manythousand men were slain and captured, together with eight elephants.This was the last battle which Marcellus fought in Sicily, after whichhe returned victorious to Syracuse. The year was now about closing;the senate therefore decreed that Publius Cornelius, the praetor,should send a letter to Capua to the consuls, with directions thatwhile Hannibal was at a distance, and nothing of any great importancewas going on at Capua, one of them, if they thought fit, should cometo Rome to elect new magistrates. On the receipt of the letter, theconsuls arranged it between themselves, that Claudius should hold theelection, and Fulvius remain at Capua. The consuls created by Claudiuswere Cneius Fulvius Centumalus, and Publius Sulpicius Galba, the sonof Servius, who had never exercised any curule magistracy. After thisLucius Cornelius Lentulus, Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, Caius Sulpicius,and Caius Calpurnius Piso, were created praetors. Piso had the cityjurisdiction; Sulpicius, Sicily; Cethegus, Apulia; Lentulus, Sardinia.The consuls were continued in command for a year longer."Book 26,Chapter 1,"The consuls, Cneius Fulvius Centumalus and Publius Sulpicius Galba,having entered on their office on the ides of March, assembled thesenate in the Capitol, and took the opinion of the fathers on thestate of the republic, the manner of conducting the war, and on whatrelated to the provinces and the armies. Quintus Fulvius and AppiusClaudius, the consuls of the former year, were continued in command;and the armies which they before had were assigned to them, it beingadded that they should not withdraw from Capua, which they werebesieging, till they had taken it. The Romans were now solicitouslyintent upon this object, not from resentment so much, which was neverjuster against any city, as from the consideration that as this city,so celebrated and powerful, had by its defection drawn away severalstates, so when reduced it would bring back their minds to respect forthe former supreme government. Two praetors also of the former year,Marcus Junius and Publius Sempronius, were each continued in commandof the two legions which they had under them, the former in Etruria,the latter in Gaul. Marcus Marcellus also was continued in command,that he might, as proconsul, finish the war in Sicily with the army hehad there. If he wanted recruits he was to take them from the legionswhich Publius Cornelius, the propraetor, commanded in Sicily, providedhe did not choose any soldier who was of the number of those whom thesenate had refused to allow to be discharged, or to return home tillthe war was put an end to. To Caius Sulpicius, to whose lot Sicily hadfallen, the two legions which Publius Cornelius had commanded wereassigned, to be recruited from the army of Cneius Fulvius, which hadbeen shamefully beaten, and had experienced a dreadful loss the yearbefore in Apulia. To soldiers of this description the senate hadassigned the same period of service as to those who fought at Cannae;and as an additional mark of ignominy upon both, they were not allowedto winter in towns, or to build huts for wintering within the distanceof ten miles from any town. To Lucius Cornelius, in Sardinia, the twolegions which Quintus Mucius had commanded were assigned; if recruitswere wanted, the consuls were ordered to enlist them. To TitusOtacilius and Marcus Valerius was allotted the protection of thecoasts of Sicily and Greece, with the legions and fleets which theyhad commanded. The Greek coast had fifty ships with one legion; theSicilian, a hundred ships with two legions. Twenty-three legions wereemployed by the Romans in carrying on the war this year by land andsea."Book 26,Chapter 2,"In the beginning of the year, on a letter from Lucius Marcius beinglaid before the senate, they considered his achievements as mostglorious; but the title of honour which he assumed (for though he wasneither invested with the command by the order of the people, nor bythe direction of the fathers, his letter ran in this form, ""Thepropraetor to the senate"") gave offence to a great many. It wasconsidered as an injurious precedent for generals to be chosen by thearmies, and for the solemn ceremony of elections, held under auspices,to be transferred to camps and provinces, and (far from the control ofthe laws and magistrates) to military thoughtlessness. And though somegave it as their opinion, that the sense of the senate should be takenon the matter, yet it was thought more advisable that the discussionshould be postponed till after the departure of the horsemen whobrought the letter from Marcius. It was resolved, that an answershould be returned respecting the corn and clothing of the army,stating, that the senate would direct its attention to both thosematters; but that the letter should not be addressed to LuciusMarcius, propraetor, lest he should consider that as alreadydetermined which was the very point they reserved for discussion.After the horsemen were dismissed, it was the first thing the consulsbrought before the senate; and the opinions of all to a man coincided,that the plebeian tribunes should be instructed to consult the commonswith all possible speed, as to whom they might resolve to send intoSpain to take the command of that army which had been under theconduct of Cneius Scipio. The plebeian tribunes were instructedaccordingly, and the question was published. But another contest hadpre-engaged the minds of the people: Caius Sempronius Blaesus, havingbrought Cneius Fulvius to trial for the loss of the army in Apulia,harassed him with invectives in the public assemblies: ""Manygenerals,"" he reiterated, ""had by indiscretion and ignorance broughttheir armies into most perilous situations, but none, save CneiusFulvius, had corrupted his legions by every species of excess beforehe betrayed them to the enemy; it might therefore with truth be said,that they were lost before they saw the enemy, and that they weredefeated, not by Hannibal, but by their own general. No man, when hegave his vote, took sufficient pains in ascertaining who it was towhom he was intrusting an army. What a difference was there betweenthis man and Tiberius Sempronius! The latter having been intrustedwith an army of slaves, had in a short time brought it to pass, bydiscipline and authority, that not one of them in the field of battleremembered his condition and birth, but they became a protection toour allies and a terror to our enemies. They had snatched, as it were,from the very jaws of Hannibal, and restored to the Roman people,Cumae, Beneventum, and other towns. But Cneius Fulvius had infectedwith the vices peculiar to slaves, an army of Roman citizens, ofhonourable parentage and liberal education; and had thus made theminsolent and turbulent among their allies, inefficient and dastardlyamong their enemies, unable to sustain, not only the charge, but theshout of the Carthaginians. But, by Hercules, it was no wonder thatthe troops did not stand their ground in the battle, when theirgeneral was the first to fly; with him, the greater wonder was thatany had fallen at their posts, and that they were not all thecompanions of Cneius Fulvius in his consternation and his flight.Caius Flaminius, Lucius Paullus, Lucius Posthumius, Cneius and PubliusScipio, had preferred falling in the battle to abandoning their armieswhen in the power of the enemy. But Cneius Fulvius was almost the onlyman who returned to Rome to report the annihilation of his army. Itwas a shameful crime that the army of Cannae should be transportedinto Sicily, because they fled from the field of battle, and not beallowed to return till the enemy has quitted Italy; that the samedecree should have been lately passed with respect to the legions ofCneius Fulvius; while Cneius Fulvius himself has no punishmentinflicted upon him for running away, in a battle brought about by hisown indiscretion; that he himself should be permitted to pass his oldage in stews and brothels, where he passed his youth, while histroops, whose only crime was that they resembled their general, shouldbe sent away in a manner into banishment, and suffer an ignominiousservice. So unequally,"" he said, ""was liberty shared at Rome by therich and the poor, by the ennobled and the common people."""Book 26,Chapter 3,"The accused shifted the blame from himself to his soldiers; hesaid, ""that in consequence of their having in the most turbulentmanner demanded battle, they were led into the field, not on the daythey desired, for it was then evening, but on the following; that theywere drawn up at a suitable time and on favourable ground; but eitherthe reputation or the strength of the enemy was such, that they wereunable to stand their ground. When they all fled precipitately, hehimself also was carried away with the crowd, as had happened to Varroat the battle of Cannae, and to many other generals. How could he, byhis sole resistance, benefit the republic, unless his death wouldremedy the public disasters? that he was not defeated in consequenceof a failure in his provisions; that he had not, from want of caution,been drawn into a disadvantageous position; that he had not been cutoff by an ambuscade in consequence of not having explored his route,but had been vanquished by open force, and by arms, in a regularengagement. He had not in his power the minds of his own troops, orthose of the enemy. Courage and cowardice were the result of eachman's natural constitution."" He was twice accused, and the penalty waslaid at a fine. On the third accusation, at which witnesses wereproduced, he was not only overwhelmed with an infinity of disgracefulcharges, but a great many asserted on oath, that the flight and paniccommenced with the praetor, that the troops being deserted by him, andconcluding that the fears of their general were not unfounded, turnedtheir backs; when so strong a feeling of indignation was excited, thatthe assembly clamorously rejoined that he ought to be tried capitally.This gave rise to a new controversy; for when the tribune, who hadtwice prosecuted him as for a finable offence, now, on the thirdoccasion, declared that he prosecuted him capitally; the tribunes ofthe commons being appealed to, said, ""they would not prevent theircolleague from proceeding, as he was permitted according to the customof their ancestors, in the manner he himself preferred, whetheraccording to the laws or to custom, until he had obtained judgmentagainst a private individual, convicting him either of a capital orfinable offence."" Upon this, Sempronius said, that he charged CneiusFulvius with the crime of treason; and requested Caius Calpurnius, thecity praetor, to appoint a day for the comitia. Another ground of hopewas then tried by the accused, viz. if his brother, Quintus Fulvius,could be present at his trial, who was at that time flourishing in thefame of his past achievements and in the near expectation of takingCapua. Fulvius wrote to the senate, requesting the favour in termscalculated to excite compassion, in order to save the life of hisbrother; but the fathers replied, that the interest of the state wouldnot admit of his leaving Capua. Cneius Fulvius, therefore, before theday appointed for the comitia arrived, went into exile to Tarquinii,and the commons resolved that it was a legal exile."Book 26,Chapter 4,"Meanwhile all the strength of the war was directed against Capua.It was, however, more strictly blockaded than besieged. The slaves andpopulace could neither endure the famine, nor send messengers toHannibal through guards so closely stationed. A Numidian was at lengthfound, who, on undertaking to make his way with it, was charged with aletter; and going out by night, through the midst of the Roman camp,in order to fulfil his promise, he inspired the Campanians withconfidence to try the effect of a sally from every quarter, while theyhad any strength remaining. In the many encounters which followed,their cavalry were generally successful, but their infantry werebeaten: however, it was by no means so joyful to conquer, as it wasmiserable to be worsted in any respect by a besieged and almostsubdued enemy. A plan was at length adopted, by which their deficiencyin strength might be compensated by stratagem. Young men were selectedfrom all the legions, who, from the vigour and activity of theirbodies, excelled in swiftness; these were supplied with bucklersshorter than those worn by horsemen, and seven javelins each, fourfeet in length, and pointed with steel in the same manner as thespears used by light-armed troops. The cavalry taking one of theseeach upon their horses, accustomed them to ride behind them, and toleap down nimbly when the signal was given. When, by daily practice,they appeared to be able to do this in an orderly manner, theyadvanced into the plain between the camp and the walls, against thecavalry of the Campanians, who stood there prepared for action. Assoon as they came within a dart's cast, on a signal given, the lighttroops leaped down, when a line of infantry formed out of the body ofhorse suddenly rushed upon the cavalry of the enemy, and dischargedtheir javelins one after another with great rapidity; which beingthrown in great numbers upon men and horses indiscriminately, woundeda great many. The sudden and unsuspected nature of the attack,however, occasioned still greater terror; and the cavalry chargingthem, thus panic-struck, chased them with great slaughter as far astheir gates. From that time the Roman cavalry had the superiority; andit was established that there should be velites in the legions. It issaid that Quintus Navius was the person who advised the mixing ofinfantry with cavalry, and that he received honour from the general onthat account."Book 26,Chapter 5,"While affairs were in this state at Capua, Hannibal was perplexedbetween two objects, the gaining possession of the citadel ofTarentum, and the retaining of Capua. His concern for Capua, however,prevailed, on which he saw that the attention of every body, alliesand enemies, was fixed; and whose fate would be regarded as a proof ofthe consequences resulting from defection from the Romans. Leavingtherefore, a great part of his baggage among the Bruttians, and allhis heavier armed troops, he took with him a body of infantry andcavalry, the best he could select for marching expeditiously, and benthis course into Campania. Rapidly as he marched he was followed bythirty-three elephants. He took up his position in a retired valleybehind Mount Tifata, which overhung Capua. Having at his coming takenpossession of fort Galatia, the garrison of which he dislodged byforce, he then directed his efforts against those who were besiegingCapua. Having sent forward messengers to Capua stating the time atwhich he would attack the Roman camp, in order that they also, havinggotten themselves in readiness for a sally, might at the same timepour forth from all their gates, he occasioned the greatest possibleterror; for on one side he himself attacked them suddenly, and on theother side all the Campanians sallied forth, both foot and horse,joined by the Carthaginian garrison under the command of Bostar andHanno. The Romans, lest in so perilous an affair they should leave anypart unprotected, by running together to any one place, thus dividedtheir forces: Appius Claudius was opposed to the Campanians; Fulviusto Hannibal; Caius Nero, the propraetor, with the cavalry of the sixthlegion, placed himself in the road leading to Suessula; and CaiusFulvius Flaccus, the lieutenant-general, with the allied cavalry, onthe side opposite the river Vulturnus. The battle commenced not onlywith the usual clamour and tumult, but in addition to the din of men,horses, and arms, a multitude of Campanians, unable to bear arms,being distributed along the walls, raised such a shout together withthe clangour of brazen vessels, similar to that which is usually madein the dead of night when the moon is eclipsed, that it diverted theattention even of the combatants. Appius easily repulsed theCampanians from the rampart. On the other side Hannibal and theCarthaginians, forming a larger force, pressed hard on Fulvius. Therethe sixth legion gave way; being repulsed, a cohort of Spaniards withthree elephants made their way up to the rampart. They had brokenthrough the centre of the Roman line, and were in a state of anxiousand perilous suspense, whether to force their way into the camp, or becut off from their own army. When Fulvius saw the disorder of thelegion, and the danger the camp was in, he exhorted Quintus Navius,and the other principal centurions, to charge the cohort of the enemywhich was fighting under the rampart; he said, ""that the state ofthings was most critical; that either they must retire before them, inwhich case they would burst into the camp with less difficulty thanthey had experienced in breaking through a dense line of troops, orthey must cut them to pieces under the rampart: nor would it require agreat effort; for they were few, and cut off from their own troops,and if the line which appeared broken, now while the Romans weredispirited, should turn upon the enemy on both sides, they wouldbecome enclosed in the midst, and exposed to a twofold attack.""Navius, on hearing these words of the general, snatched the standardof the second company of spearmen from the standard-bearer, andadvanced with it against the enemy, threatening that he would throw itinto the midst of them unless the soldiers promptly followed him andtook part in the fight. He was of gigantic stature, and his arms sethim off; the standard also, raised aloft, attracted the gaze both ofhis countrymen and the enemy. When, however, he had reached thestandards of the Spaniards, javelins were poured upon him from allsides, and almost the whole line was turned against him; but neitherthe number of his enemies nor the force of the weapons could repel theonset of this hero."Book 26,Chapter 6,"Marcus Atilius, the lieutenant-general, also caused the standard ofthe first company of principes of the same legion to be borne againsta cohort of the Spaniards. Lucius Portius Licinus and Titus Popilius,the lieutenant-generals, who had the command of the camp, foughtvaliantly in defence of the rampart, and slew the elephants while inthe very act of crossing it. The carcasses of these filling up theditch, afforded a passage for the enemy as effectually as if earth hadbeen thrown in, or a bridge erected over it; and a horrid carnage tookplace amid the carcasses of the elephants which lay prostrate. On theother side of the camp, the Campanians, with the Carthaginiangarrison, had by this time been repulsed, and the battle was carriedon immediately under the gate of Capua leading to Vulturnus. Nor didthe armed men contribute so much in resisting the Romans, whoendeavoured to force their way in, as the gate itself, which, beingfurnished with ballistas and scorpions, kept the enemy at bay by themissiles discharged from it. The ardour of the Romans was also clampedby the general, Appius Claudius, receiving a wound; he was struck by ajavelin in the upper part of his breast, beneath the left shoulder,while encouraging his men before the front line. A great number,however, of the enemy were slain before the gate, and the rest weredriven in disorder into the city. When Hannibal saw the destruction ofthe cohort of Spaniards, and that the camp of the enemy was defendedwith the utmost vigour, giving up the assault, he began to withdrawhis standards, making his infantry face about, but throwing out hiscavalry in the rear lest the enemy should pursue them closely. Theardour of the legions to pursue the enemy was excessive, but Flaccusordered a retreat to be sounded, considering that enough had beenachieved to convince the Campanians, and Hannibal himself, how unablehe was to afford them protection. Some who have undertaken to giveaccounts of this battle, record that eight thousand of the army ofHannibal, and three thousand Campanians, were slain; that fifteenmilitary standards were taken from the Carthaginians, and eighteenfrom the Campanians. In other authors I find the battle to have beenby no means so important, and that there was more of panic thanfighting; that a party of Numidians and Spaniards suddenly burstinginto the Roman camp with some elephants, the elephants, as they madetheir way through the midst of the camp, threw down their tents with agreat noise, and caused the beasts of burden to break their haltersand run away. That in addition to the confusion occasioned, astratagem was employed; Hannibal having sent in some personsacquainted with the Latin language, for he had some such with him, whomight command the soldiers, in the name of the consuls, to escapeevery one as fast as he could to the neighbouring mountains, since thecamp was lost; but that the imposture was soon discovered, andfrustrated with a great slaughter of the enemy; that the elephantswere driven out of the camp by fire. However commenced, and howeverterminated, this was the last battle which was fought before thesurrender of Capua. Seppius Lesius was Medixtuticus, or chiefmagistrate of Capua, that year, a man of obscure origin and slenderfortune. It is reported that his mother, when formerly expiating aprodigy which had occurred in the family in behalf of this boy, whowas an orphan, received an answer from the aruspex, stating, that ""thehighest office would come to him;"" and that not recognising, at Capua,any ground for such a hope, exclaimed, ""the state of the Campaniansmust be desperate indeed, when the highest office shall come to myson."" But even this expression, in which the response was turned intoridicule, turned to be true, for those persons whose birth allowedthem to aspire to high offices, refusing to accept them when the citywas oppressed by sword and famine, and when all hope was lost, Lesius,who complained that Capua was deserted and betrayed by its nobles,accepted the office of chief magistrate, being the last Campanian whoheld it."Book 26,Chapter 7,"But Hannibal, when he saw that the enemy could not be drawn intoanother engagement, nor a passage be forced through their camp intoCapua, resolved to remove his camp from that place and leave theattempt unaccomplished, fearful lest the new consuls might cut off hissupplies of provision. While anxiously deliberating on the point towhich he should next direct his course, an impulse suddenly enteredhis mind to make an attack on Rome, the very source of the war. Thatthe opportunity of accomplishing this ever coveted object, whichoccurred after the battle of Cannae, had been neglected, and wasgenerally censured by others, he himself did not deny. He thought thatthere was some hope that he might be able to get possession of somepart of the city, in consequence of the panic and confusion which hisunexpected approach would occasion, and that if Rome were in danger,either both the Roman generals, or at least one of them, wouldimmediately leave Capua; and if they divided their forces, bothgenerals being thus rendered weaker, would afford a favourableopportunity either to himself or the Campanians of gaining someadvantage. One consideration only disquieted him, and that was, leston his departure the Campanians should immediately surrender. By meansof presents he induced a Numidian, who was ready to attempt any thing,however daring, to take charge of a letter; and, entering the Romancamp under the disguise of a deserter, to pass out privately on theother side and go to Capua. As to the letter, it was full ofencouragement. It stated, that ""his departure, which would bebeneficial to them, would have the effect of drawing off the Romangenerals and armies from the siege of Capua to the defence of Rome.That they must not allow their spirits to sink; that by a few days'patience they would rid themselves entirely of the siege."" He thenordered the ships on the Vulturnus to be seized, and rowed up to thefort which he had before erected for his protection. And when he wasinformed that there were as many as were necessary to convey his armyacross in one night, after providing a stock of provisions for tendays, he led his legions down to the river by night, and passed themover before daylight."Book 26,Chapter 8,"Fulvius Flaccus, who had discovered from deserters that this wouldhappen, before it took place, having written to Rome to the senate toapprize them of it, men's minds were variously affected by itaccording to the disposition of each. As might be expected in soalarming an emergency, the senate was immediately assembled, whenPublius Cornelius, surnamed Asina, was for recalling all the generalsand armies from every part of Italy to protect the city, disregardingCapua and every other concern. Fabius Maximus thought that it would behighly disgraceful to retire from Capua, and allow themselves to beterrified and driven about at the nod and menaces of Hannibal. ""Was itprobable that he, who, though victorious at Cannae, nevertheless darednot approach the city, now, after having been repulsed from Capua, hadconceived hopes of making himself master of Rome? It was not tobesiege Rome, but to raise the siege of Capua that he was coming.Jupiter, the witness of treaties violated by Hannibal, and the otherdeities, would defend the city of Rome with that army which is now atthe city."" To these opposite opinions, that of Publius ValeriusFlaccus, which recommended a middle course, was preferred. Regardfulof both objects, he thought that a letter should be written to thegenerals at Capua, informing them of the force they had at the cityfor its protection, and stating, that as to the number of forces whichHannibal was bringing with him, or how large an army was necessary tocarry on the siege of Capua, they themselves knew. If one of thegenerals and a part of the army could be sent to Rome, and at the sametime Capua could be efficiently besieged by the remaining general andarmy, that then Claudius and Fulvius should settle between themselveswhich should continue the siege of Capua, and which should come toRome to protect their capital from being besieged. This decree of thesenate having been conveyed to Capua, Quintus Fulvius, the proconsul,who was to go to Rome, as his colleague was ill from his wound,crossed the Vulturnus with a body of troops, to the number of fifteenthousand infantry and a thousand horse, selected from the threearmies. Then having ascertained that Hannibal intended to proceedalong the Latin road, he sent persons before him to the towns on andnear the Appian way, Setia, Cora, and Lanuvium, with directions thatthey should not only have provisions ready in their towns, but shouldbring them down to the road from the fields which lay out of the way,and that they should draw together into their towns troops for theirdefence, in order that each state might be under its own protection."Book 26,Chapter 9,"On the day he crossed the Vulturnus, Hannibal pitched his camp at asmall distance from the river. The next day, passing by Cales, hereached the Sidicinian territory, and having spent a day there indevastating the country, he led his troops along the Latin way throughthe territory of Suessa, Allifae, and Casinum. Under the walls ofCasinum he remained encamped for two days, ravaging the country allaround; thence passing by Interamna and Aquinum, he came into theFregellan territory, to the river Liris, where he found the bridgebroken down by the Fregellans in order to impede his progress. Fulviusalso was detained at the Vulturnus, in consequence of Hannibal'shaving burnt the ships, and the difficulty he had in procuring raftsto convey his troops across that river from the great scarcity ofmaterials. The army having been conveyed across by rafts, theremainder of the march of Fulvius was uninterrupted, a liberal supplyof provisions having been prepared for him, not only in all the towns,but also on the sides of the road; while his men, who were allactivity, exhorted each other to quicken their pace, remembering thatthey were going to defend their country. A messenger from Fregella,who had travelled a day and a night without intermission, arriving atRome, caused the greatest consternation; and the whole city was throwninto a state of alarm by the running up and down of persons who madevague additions to what they heard, and thus increased the confusionwhich the original intelligence created. The lamentations of womenwere not only heard from private houses, but the matrons from everyquarter, rushing into the public streets, ran up and down around theshrines of the gods, sweeping the altars with their dishevelled hair,throwing themselves upon their knees and stretching their upliftedhands to heaven and the gods, imploring them to rescue the city ofRome out of the hands of their enemies, and preserve the Roman mothersand their children from harm. The senate sat in the forum near themagistrates, in case they should wish to consult them. Some werereceiving orders and departing to their own department of duty; otherswere offering themselves wherever there might be occasion for theiraid. Troops were posted in the citadel, in the Capitol, upon the wallsaround the city, and also on the Alban mount, and the fort of Aesula.During this confusion, intelligence was brought that Quintus Fulvius,the proconsul, had set out from Capua with an army; when the senatedecreed that Quintus Fulvius should have equal authority with theconsuls, lest on entering the city his power should cease. Hannibal,having most destructively ravaged the Fregellan territory, on accountof the bridge having been broken down, came into the territory of theLavici, passing through those of Frusino, Ferentinum, and Anagnia;thence passing through Algidum he directed his course to Tusculum; butnot being received within the walls, he went down to the right belowTusculum to Gabii; and marching his army down thence into theterritory of the Pupinian tribe, he pitched his camp eight miles fromthe city. The nearer the enemy came, the greater was the number offugitives slain by the Numidians who preceded him, and the greater thenumber of prisoners made of every rank and age."Book 26,Chapter 10,"During this confusion, Fulvius Flaccus entered the city with histroops through the Capuan gate, passed through the midst of the city,and through Carinae, to Esquiliae; and going out thence, pitched hiscamp between the Esquiline and Colline gates. The plebeian aedilesbrought a supply of provisions there. The consuls and the senate cameto the camp, and a consultation was held on the state of the republic.It was resolved that the consuls should encamp in the neighbourhood ofthe Colline and Esquiline gates; that Caius Calpurnius, the citypraetor, should have the command of the Capitol and the citadel; andthat a full senate should be continually assembled in the forum, incase it should be necessary to consult them amidst such suddenemergencies. Meanwhile, Hannibal advanced his camp to the Anio, threemiles from the city, and fixing his position there, he advanced withtwo thousand horse from the Colline gate as far as the temple ofHercules, and riding up, took as near a view as he could of the wallsand site of the city. Flaccus, indignant that he should do this sofreely, and so much at his ease, sent out a party of cavalry, withorders to displace and drive back to their camp the cavalry of theenemy. After the fight had begun, the consuls ordered the Numidiandeserters who were on the Aventine, to the number of twelve hundred,to march through the midst of the city to the Esquiliae, judging thatno troops were better calculated to fight among the hollows, thegarden walls, and tombs, or in the enclosed roads which were on allsides. But some persons, seeing them from the citadel and Capitol asthey filed off on horseback down the Publician hill, cried out thatthe Aventine was taken. This circumstance occasioned such confusionand terror, that if the Carthaginian camp had not been without thecity, the whole multitude, such was their alarm, would have rushedout. They then fled for refuge into their houses and upon the roofs,where they threw stones and weapons on their own soldiers as theypassed along the streets, taking them for enemies. Nor could thetumult be repressed, or the mistake explained, as the streets werethronged with crowds of rustics and cattle, which the sudden alarm haddriven into the city. The battle between the cavalry was successful,and the enemy were driven away; and as it was necessary to repress thetumults which were arising in several quarters without any cause, itwas resolved that all who had been dictators, consuls, or censors,should be invested with authority till such time as the enemy hadretired from the walls. During the remainder of the day and thefollowing night, several tumults arose without any foundation, andwere repressed."Book 26,Chapter 11,"The next day Hannibal, crossing the Anio, drew out all his forcesin order of battle; nor did Flaccus and the consuls decline to fight.When the troops on both sides were drawn up to try the issue of abattle, in which Rome was to be the prize of the victors, a violentshower of rain mingled with hail created such disorder in both thelines, that the troops, scarcely able to hold their arms, retired totheir camps, less through fear of the enemy than of any thing else. Onthe following day, likewise, a similar tempest separated the armiesmarshalled on the same ground; but after they had retired to theircamps the weather became wonderfully serene and tranquil. TheCarthaginians considered this circumstance as a Divine interposition,and it is reported that Hannibal was heard to say, ""That sometimes hewanted the will to make himself master of Rome, at other times theopportunity."" Two other circumstances also, one inconsiderable, theother important, diminished his hopes. The important one was, thatwhile he lay with his armed troops near the walls of the city, he wasinformed that troops had marched out of it with colours flying, as areinforcement for Spain; that of less importance was, that he wasinformed by one of his prisoners, that the very ground on which hiscamp stood was sold at this very time, without any diminution in itsprice. Indeed, so great an insult and indignity did it appear to himthat a purchaser should be found at Rome for the very soil which heheld and possessed by right of conquest, that he immediately called acrier, and ordered that the silversmiths' shops, which at that timestood around the Roman forum, should be put up for sale. Induced bythese circumstances he retired to the river Tutia, six miles from thecity, whence he proceeded to the grove of Feronia, where was a templeat that time celebrated for its riches. The Capenatians and otherstates in the neighbourhood, by bringing here their first-fruits andother offerings according to their abilities, kept it decorated withabundance of gold and silver. Of all these offerings the temple wasnow despoiled. After the departure of Hannibal, vast heaps of brasswere found there, as the soldiers, from a religious feeling, hadthrown in pieces of uncoined brass. The spoliation of this temple isundoubted by historians; but Caelius asserts, that Hannibal, in hisprogress to Rome, turned out of his way to it from Eretum. Accordingto him his route commenced with Amiternum, Caetilii, and Reate. Hecame from Campania into Samnium, and thence into Pelignia; thenpassing the town Sulmio, he entered the territory of the Marrucini;thence through the Alban territory he came to that of the Marsi, fromwhich he came to Amiternum and the village of Foruli. Nor is thisdiversity of opinion a proof that the traces of so great an army couldbe confounded in the lapse of so brief a period. That he went that wayis evident. The only question is, whether he took this route to thecity, or returned by it from the city into Campania?"Book 26,Chapter 12,"With regard to Capua, Hannibal did not evince such obstinateperseverance in raising the siege of it as the Romans did in pressingit; for quitting Lucania, he came into the Bruttian territory, andmarched to the strait and Rhegium with such rapidity, that he was verynear taking the place by surprise, in consequence of the suddenness ofhis arrival. Though the siege had been urged with undiminished vigourduring his absence, yet Capua felt the return of Flaccus; andastonishment was excited that Hannibal had not returned with him.Afterwards they learnt, by conversations, that they were abandoned anddeserted, and that the Carthaginians had given up all hopes ofretaining Capua. In addition to this a proclamation was made by theproconsul, agreeably to a decree of the senate, and published amongthe enemy, that any Campanian citizen who came over before a statedday should be indemnified. No one, however, came over, as they wereheld together by fear more than fidelity; for the crimes they hadcommitted during their revolt were too great to admit of pardon. Asnone of them passed over to the enemy, consulting their own individualinterest, so no measure of safety was taken with regard to the generalbody. The nobility had deserted the state, nor could they be inducedto meet in the senate, while the office of chief magistrate was filledby a man who had not derived honour to himself from his office, butstripped the office of its influence and authority by his ownunworthiness. Now none of the nobles made their appearance even in theforum, or any public place, but shut themselves up in their houses, indaily expectation of the downfall of their city, and their owndestruction together. The chief responsibility in every thing devolvedupon Bostar and Hanno, the praefects of the Punic garrison, who wereanxious on account of their own danger, and not that of their allies.They addressed a letter to Hannibal, in terms, not only of freedom,but severity, charging him with ""delivering, not only Capua into thehands of the enemy, but with treacherously abandoning themselves also,and their troops, to every species of torture;"" they told him ""he hadgone off to the Bruttians, in order to get out of the way, as it were,lest Capua should be taken before his eyes; while, by Hercules, theRomans, on the contrary, could not be drawn off from the siege ofCapua, even by an attack upon their city. So much more constant werethe Romans in their enmity than the Carthaginians in their friendship.If he would return to Capua and direct the whole operations of the warto that point, that both themselves and the Campanians would beprepared for a sally. That they had crossed the Alps not to carry on awar with the people of Rhegium nor Tarentum. That where the Romanlegions were, there the armies of the Carthaginians ought to be. Thusit was that victories had been gained at Cannae and Trasimenus; byuniting, by pitching their camp close to that of the enemy, by tryingtheir fortune."" A letter to this effect was given to some Numidianswho had already engaged to render their services for a stated reward.These men came into the camp to Flaccus under pretence of beingdeserters, with the intention of quitting it by seizing anopportunity, and the famine, which had so long existed at Capua,afforded a pretext for desertion which no one could suspect. But aCampanian woman, the paramour of one of the deserters, unexpectedlyentered the camp, and informed the Roman general that the Numidianshad come over according to a preconcerted plan of treachery, and werethe bearers of letters to Hannibal; that she was prepared to convictone of the party of that fact, as he had discovered it to her. Onbeing brought forward, he at first pretended, with considerablepertinacity, that he did not know the woman; but afterwards, graduallysuccumbing to the force of truth, when he saw the instruments oftorture called for and preparing, he confessed that it was so. Theletters were produced, and a discovery was made of an additional fact,before concealed, that other Numidians were strolling about in theRoman camp, under pretence of being deserters. Above seventy of thesewere arrested, and, with the late deserters, scourged with rods; andafter their hands had been cut off, were driven back to Capua. Thesight of so severe a punishment broke the spirit of the Campanians."Book 26,Chapter 13,"The people, rushing in crowds to the senate-house, compelledLesius to assemble a senate, and openly threatened the nobles, who hadnow for a long time absented themselves from the public deliberations,that unless they attended the meeting of the senate, they would goround to their houses and drag them all before the public by force.The fear of this procured the magistrate a full senate. Here, whilethe rest contended for sending ambassadors to the Roman generals,Vibius Virrius, who had been the instigator of the revolt from theRomans, on being asked his opinion, observed, that ""those persons whospoke of sending ambassadors, and of peace, and a surrender, did notbear in mind either what they would do if they had the Romans in theirpower, or what they themselves must expect to suffer. What! do youthink,"" says he, ""that your surrender will be like that in whichformerly we placed ourselves and every thing belonging to us at thedisposal of the Romans, in order that we might obtain assistance fromthem against the Samnites? Have you already forgotten at what ajuncture we revolted from the Romans, and what were theircircumstances? Have you forgotten how at the time of the revolt we putto death, with torture and indignity, their garrison, which might havebeen sent out? How often, and with determined hostility, we havesallied out against them when besieging us, and assaulted their camp?How we invited Hannibal to come and cut them off? And how mostrecently we sent him hence to lay siege to Rome? But come, retrace onthe other hand what they have done in hostility towards us, that youmay learn therefrom what you have to hope for. When a foreign enemywas in Italy, and that enemy Hannibal; when the flame of war waskindled in every quarter; disregarding every other object,disregarding even Hannibal himself, they sent two consuls with twoconsular armies to lay siege to Capua. This is the second year, that,surrounded with lines and shut up within our walls, they consume us byfamine, having suffered in like manner with ourselves the extremestdangers and the severest hardships, having frequently had their troopsslain near their rampart and trenches, and at last having been almostdeprived of their camp. But I pass over these matters. It has beenusual, even from of old, to suffer dangers and hardships in besiegingan enemy's city. The following is a proof of their animosity andbitter hatred. Hannibal assaulted their camp with an immense force ofhorse and foot, and took a part of it. By so great a danger they werenot in the least diverted from the siege. Crossing the Vulturnus, helaid waste the territory of Cales with fire. Such calamities inflictedupon their allies had no effect in calling them off. He ordered histroops to march in hostile array to the very city of Rome. Theydespised the tempest which threatened them in this case also. Crossingthe Anio, he pitched his camp three miles from the city, and lastly,came up to the very walls and gates. He gave them to understand thathe would take their city from them, unless they gave up Capua. Butthey did not give it up. Wild beasts, impelled by headlong fury andrage, you may divert from their object to bring assistance to thosebelonging to them, if you attempt to approach their dens and theiryoung. The Romans could not be diverted from Capua by the blockade ofRome, by their wives and children, whose lamentations could almost beheard from this place, by their altars, their hearths, the temples oftheir gods, and the sepulchres of their ancestors profaned andviolated. So great was their avidity to bring us to punishment, soinsatiable their thirst for drinking our blood. Nor, perhaps, withoutreason. We too would have done the same had the opportunity beenafforded us. Since, however, the gods have thought proper to determineit otherwise, though I ought not to shrink from death, while I amfree, while I am master of myself, I have it in my power, by a deathnot only honourable but mild, to escape the tortures and indignitieswhich the enemy hope to inflict upon me. I will not see AppiusClaudius and Quintus Fulvius in the pride and insolence of victory,nor will I be dragged in chains through Rome as a spectacle in atriumph, that afterwards in a dungeon, or tied to a stake, after myback has been lacerated with stripes, I may place my neck under aRoman axe. I will neither see my native city demolished and burnt, northe matrons, virgins, and free-born youths of Campania dragged toconstupration. Alba, from which they themselves derived their origin,they demolished from her foundations, that there might remain no traceof their rise and extraction, much less can I believe they will spareCapua, towards which they bear a more rancorous hatred than towardsCarthage. For such of you, therefore, as have a mind to yield to fate,before they behold such horrors, a banquet is furnished and preparedat my house. When satiated with wine and food, the same cup whichshall have been given to me shall be handed round to them. That potionwill rescue our bodies from torture, our minds from insult, our eyesand ears from seeing and hearing all those cruelties and indignitieswhich await the vanquished. There will be persons in readiness whowill throw our lifeless bodies upon a large pile kindled in thecourt-yard of the house. This is the only free and honourable way todeath. Our very enemies will admire our courage, and Hannibal willlearn that those whom he deserted and betrayed were brave allies."""Book 26,Chapter 14,"More of those who heard this speech of Virrius approved of theproposal contained in it, than had strength of mind to execute whatthey approved. The greater part of the senate being not without hopesthat the Romans, whose clemency they had frequently had proof of inmany wars, would be exorable by them also, decreed and sentambassadors to surrender Capua to the Romans. About twenty-sevensenators, following Vibius Virrius to his home, partook of the banquetwith him; and after having, as far as they could, withdrawn theirminds, by means of wine, from the perception of the impending evil,all took the poison. They then rose from the banquet, after givingeach other their right hands, and taking a last embrace, minglingtheir tears for their own and their country's fate; some of themremained, that they might be burned upon the same pile, and the restretired to their homes. Their veins being filled in consequence ofwhat they had eaten, and the wine they drank, rendered the poison lessefficacious in expediting death; and accordingly, though the greaterpart of them languished the whole of that night and part of thefollowing day, all of them, however, breathed their last before thegates were opened to the enemy. The following day the gate of Jupiter,which faced the Roman camp, was opened by order of the proconsul, whenone legion and two squadrons of allies marched in at it, under thecommand of Caius Fulvius, lieutenant-general. When he had taken carethat all the arms and weapons to be found in Capua should be broughtto him; having placed guards at all the gates to prevent any one'sgoing or being sent out, he seized the Carthaginian garrison, andordered the Campanian senators to go into the camp to the Romangenerals. On their arrival they were all immediately thrown intochains, and ordered to lay before the quaestor an account of all thegold and silver they had. There were seventy pounds of gold, and threethousand two hundred of silver. Twenty-five of the senators were sentto Cales, to be kept in custody, and twenty-eight to Teanum; thesebeing the persons by whose advice principally it appeared that therevolt from the Romans had taken place."Book 26,Chapter 15,"Fulvius and Claudius were far from being agreed as to thepunishment of the Campanian senators. Claudius was disposed to granttheir prayer for pardon, but Fulvius was more inclined to severity.Appius, therefore, was for referring the entire disposal of thequestion to the Roman senate. He thought it right also, that thefathers should have the opportunity of asking them whether any of theLatin confederates, or of the municipal towns, had taken part in thesedesigns, and whether they had derived any assistance from them in thewar. Fulvius, on the contrary, urged that they ought by no means torun the hazard of having the minds of faithful allies harassed bydoubtful accusations, and subjected to informers who never cared atall what they did or what they said. For this reason he said that heshould prevent and put a stop to any such inquiry. After thisconversation they separated; Appius not doubting but that hiscolleague, though he expressed himself so warmly, would, nevertheless,wait for a letter from Rome, in an affair of such magnitude. ButFulvius, fearing that his designs would be frustrated by that verymeans, dismissed his council, and commanded the military tribunes andthe praefects of the allies to give notice to two thousand chosenhorsemen to be in readiness at the third trumpet. Setting out forTeanum with this body of cavalry, he entered the gate at break of day,and proceeded direct to the forum; and a number of people havingflocked together at the first entrance of the horsemen, he ordered theSidicinian magistrate to be summoned; when he desired him to bringforth the Campanians whom he had in custody. These were allaccordingly brought forth, scourged, and beheaded. He then proceededat full speed to Cales; where, when he had taken his seat on thetribunal, and while the Campanians, who had been brought forth, werebeing bound to the stake, an express arrived from Rome, and deliveredto him a letter from Caius Calpurnius, the praetor, and a decree ofthe senate. A murmur immediately pervaded the whole assembly,beginning at the tribunal, that the entire question respecting theCampanians was referred to the decision of the fathers, and Fulvius,suspecting this to be the case, took the letter, and without openingit put it into his bosom, and then commanded the crier to order thelictor to do his duty. Thus punishment was inflicted on those also whowere at Cales. The letter was then read, together with the decree ofthe senate, when it was too late to prevent the business which wasalready executed, and which had been accelerated by every means toprevent its being obstructed. When Fulvius was now rising from hisseat, Jubellius Taurea, a Campanian making his way through the middleof the city and the crowd, called upon him by name, and when Flaccus,who wondered greatly what he could want, had resumed his seat, hesaid, ""Order me also to be put to death, that you may be able toboast, that a much braver man than yourself has been put to death byyou."" Fulvius at first said, that the man could not certainly be inhis senses, then, that he was restrained by a decree of the senate,even though he might wish it, when Jubellius exclaimed ""Since, afterthe capture of my country, and the loss of my relations and friends,after having killed, with my own hand, my wife and children to preventtheir suffering any indignity, I am not allowed even to die in thesame manner as these my countrymen, let a rescue be sought in couragefrom this hated existence."" So saying, he thrust a sword, which he hadconcealed under his garment, right through his breast, and felllifeless at the general's feet."Book 26,Chapter 16,"Because not only what related to the punishment of the Campanians,but most of the other particulars of this affair, were transactedaccording to the judgment of Flaccus alone, some authors affirm thatAppius Claudius died about the time of the surrender of Capua, andthat this same Taurea neither came to Cales voluntarily nor died byhis own hand, but that while he was being tied to the stake among therest, Flaccus, who could not distinctly hear what he vociferated fromthe noise which was made, ordered silence, when Taurea said the thingswhich have been before related ""that he, a man of the greatestcourage, was being put to death by one who was by no means his equalin respect to valour."" That immediately on his saying this, theherald, by command of the proconsul, pronounced this order. ""Lictor,apply the rods to this man of courage, and execute the law upon himfirst."" Some authors also relate, that he read the decree of thesenate before he beheaded them, but that as there was a clause in it,to the effect, that if he thought proper he should refer the entirequestion to the senate, he construed it that the decision as to whatwas most for the interest of the state was left to himself. Hereturned from Cales to Capua. Atella and Calatia surrenderedthemselves, and were received. Here also the principal promoters ofthe revolt were punished. Thus eighty principal members of the senatewere put to death, and about three hundred of the Campanian noblesthrown into prison. The rest were distributed through the severalcities of the Latin confederacy, to be kept in custody, where theyperished in various ways. The rest of the Campanian citizens weresold. The remaining subject of deliberation related to the city andits territory. Some were of opinion that a city so eminently powerful,so near, and so hostile, ought to be demolished. But immediate utilityprevailed, for on account of the land, which was evidently superior toany in Italy from the variety and exuberance of its produce, the citywas preserved that it might become a settlement of husbandmen. For thepurpose of peopling the city, a number of sojourners, freed-men,dealers, and artificers, were retained, but all the land and buildingswere made the property of the Roman state. It was resolved, however,that Capua should only be inhabited and peopled as a city, that thereshould be no body-politic, nor assembly of the senate or people, normagistrates. For it was thought that a multitude not possessing anypublic council, without a ruling power, and unconnected by theparticipation of any common rights, would be incapable of combination.They resolved to send a praefect annually from Rome to administerjustice. Thus were matters adjusted at Capua, upon a plan in everyrespect worthy of commendation. Punishment was inflicted upon the mostguilty with rigour and despatch, the populace dispersed beyond allhope of return, no rage vented in fire and ruins upon the unoffendinghouses and walls. Together also with advantage, a reputation forclemency was obtained among the allies, by the preservation of a cityof the greatest celebrity and opulence, the demolition of which, allCampania, and all the people dwelling in the neighbourhood ofCampania, would have bewailed, while their enemies were compelled toadmit the ability of the Romans to punish their faithless allies, andhow little assistance could be derived from Hannibal towards thedefence of those whom he had taken under his protection."Book 26,Chapter 17,"The Roman senate having gone through every thing which requiredtheir attention relative to Capua, decreed to Caius Nero six thousandfoot and three hundred horse, whichever he should himself choose outof those two legions which he had commanded at Capua, with an equalnumber of infantry, and eight hundred horse of the Latin confederacy.This army Nero embarked at Puteoli, and conveyed over into Spain.Having arrived at Tarraco with his ships, landed his troops, hauledhis ships ashore, and armed his mariners to augment his numbers, heproceeded to the river Iberus, and received the army from TitusFonteius and Lucius Marcius. He then marched towards the enemy.Hasdrubal, son of Hamilcar, was encamped at the black stones inAusetania, a place situated between the towns Illiturgi and Mentissa.The entrance of this defile Nero seized, and Hasdrubal, to prevent hisbeing shut up in it, sent a herald to engage that, if he were allowedto depart thence, he would convey the whole of his army out of Spain.The Roman general having received this proposition gladly, Hasdrubalrequested the next day for a conference, when the Romans might draw upconditions relative to the surrender of the citadels of the towns, andthe appointment of a day on which the garrisons might be withdrawn,and the Carthaginians might remove every thing belonging to themwithout imposition. Having obtained his point in this respect,Hasdrubal gave orders that as soon as it was dark, and during thewhole of the night afterwards, the heaviest part of his force shouldget out of the defile by whatever way they could. The strictest carewas taken that many should not go out that night, that the veryfewness of their numbers might both be more adapted to elude thenotice of the enemy from their silence, and to an escape throughconfined and rugged paths. Next day they met for the conference; butthat day having been spent, on purpose, in speaking and writing abouta variety of subjects, which were not to this point, the conferencewas put off to the next day. The addition of the following night gavehim time to send still more out; nor was the business concluded thenext day. Thus several days were spent in openly discussingconditions, and as many nights in privately sending the Carthaginiantroops out of their camp; and after the greater part of the army hadbeen sent out, he did not even keep to those terms which he hadhimself proposed; and his sincerity decreasing with his fears, theybecame less and less agreed. By this time nearly all the infantry hadcleared the defile, when at daybreak a dense mist enveloped the wholedefile and the neighbouring plains; which Hasdrubal perceiving, sentto Nero to put off the conference to the following day, as theCarthaginians held that day sacred from the transaction of any seriousbusiness. Not even then was the cheat suspected. Hasdrubal havinggained the indulgence he sought for that day also, immediately quittedhis camp with his cavalry and elephants, and without creating anyalarm escaped to a place of safety. About the fourth hour the mist,being dispelled by the sun, left the atmosphere clear, when the Romanssaw that the camp of the enemy was deserted. Then at length Claudius,recognising the Carthaginian perfidy, and perceiving that he had beencaught by trickery, immediately began to pursue the enemy as theymoved off, prepared to give battle; but they declined fighting. Someskirmishes, however, took place between the rear of the Carthaginiansand the advanced guard of the Romans."Book 26,Chapter 18,"During the time in which these events occurred, neither did thosestates of Spain which had revolted after the defeat that wassustained, return to the Romans, nor did any others desert them. AtRome, the attention of the senate and people, after the recovery ofCapua, was not fixed in a greater degree upon Italy than upon Spain.They resolved that the army there should be augmented and a generalsent. They were not, however, so clear as to the person whom theyshould send, as that, where two generals had fallen within the spaceof thirty days, he who was to supply the place of them should beselected with unusual care. Some naming one person, and othersanother, they at length came to the resolution that the people shouldassemble for the purpose of electing a proconsul for Spain, and theconsuls fixed a day for the election. At first they waited inexpectation that those persons who might think themselves qualifiedfor so momentous a command would give in their names, but thisexpectation being disappointed, their grief was renewed for thecalamity they had suffered, and then regret for the generals they hadlost. The people thus afflicted, and almost at their wits' end, camedown, however, to the Campus Martius on the day of the election,where, turning towards the magistrates, they looked round at thecountenances of their most eminent men, who were earnestly gazing ateach other, and murmured bitterly, that their affairs were in soruinous a state, and the condition of the commonwealth so desperate,that no one dared undertake the command in Spain. When suddenlyPublius Cornelius, son of Publius who had fallen in Spain, who wasabout twenty-four years of age, declaring himself a candidate, tookhis station on an eminence from which he could be seen by all. Theeyes of the whole assembly were directed towards him, and byacclamations and expressions of approbation, a prosperous and happycommand were at once augured to him. Orders were then given that theyshould proceed to vote, when not only every century, but everyindividual to a man, decided that Publius Scipio should be investedwith the command in Spain. But after the business had been concluded,and the ardour and impetuosity of their zeal had subsided, a suddensilence ensued, and a secret reflection on what they had done, whethertheir partiality had not got the better of their judgment? Theychiefly regretted his youth, but some were terrified at the fortunewhich attended his house and his name, for while the two families towhich he belonged were in mourning, he was going into a province wherehe must carry on his operations between the tombs of his father andhis uncle."Book 26,Chapter 19,"Perceiving the solicitude and anxiety which people felt, afterperforming the business with so much ardour, he summoned an assembly,in which he discoursed in so noble and high minded a manner, on hisyears, the command intrusted to him, and the war which he had to carryon, as to rekindle and renew the ardour which had subsided, andinspire the people with more confident hopes than the reliance placedon human professions, or reasoning on the promising appearance ofaffairs, usually engenders. For Scipio was not only deserving ofadmiration for his real virtues, but also for his peculiar address indisplaying them, to which he had been formed from his earliestyears;--effecting many things with the multitude, either by feigningnocturnal visions or as with a mind divinely inspired; whether it wasthat he was himself, too, endued with a superstitious turn of mind, orthat they might execute his commands and adopt his plans withouthesitation, as if they proceeded from the responses of an oracle. Withthe intention of preparing men's minds for this from the beginning, henever at any time from his first assumption of the manly gowntransacted any business, public or private, without first going to theCapitol, entering the temple, and taking his seat there; where hegenerally passed a considerable time in secret and alone. Thispractice, which was adhered to through the whole of his life,occasioned in some persons a belief in a notion which generallyprevailed, whether designedly or undesignedly propagated, that he wasa man of divine extraction; and revived a report equally absurd andfabulous with that formerly spread respecting Alexander the Great,that he was begotten by a huge serpent, whose monstrous form wasfrequently observed in the bedchamber of his mother, but which, on anyone's coming in, suddenly unfolding his coils, glided out of sight.The belief in these miraculous accounts was never ridiculed by him,but rather increased by his address; neither positively denying anysuch thing nor openly affirming it. There were also many other things,some real and others counterfeit, which exceeded in the case of thisyoung man the usual measure of human admiration, in reliance on whichthe state intrusted him with an affair of so much difficulty, and withso important a command, at an age by no means ripe for it. To theforces in Spain, consisting of the remains of the old army, and thosewhich had been conveyed over from Puteoli by Claudius Nero, tenthousand infantry and a thousand horse were added; and Marcus JuniusSilanus, the propraetor, was sent to assist in the management ofaffairs. Thus with a fleet of thirty ships, all of which werequinqueremes, he set sail from the mouth of the Tiber, and coastingalong the shore of the Tuscan Sea, the Alps, and the Gallic Gulf, andthen doubling the promontory of the Pyrenees, landed his troops atEmporiae, a Greek city, which also derived its origin from Phocaea.Ordering his ships to attend him, he marched by land to Tarraco; wherehe held a congress of deputies from all the allies; for embassies hadpoured forth from every province on the news of his arrival. Here heordered his ships to be hauled on shore, having sent back the fourtriremes of the Massilians which had, in compliment to him, attendedhim from their home. After that, he began to give answers to theembassies of the several states, which had been in suspense on accountof the many vicissitudes of the war; and this with so great dignity,arising from the great confidence he had in his own talents, that nopresumptuous expression ever escaped him; and in every thing he saidthere appeared at once the greatest majesty and sincerity."Book 26,Chapter 20,"Setting out from Tarraco, he visited the states of his allies andthe winter quarters of his army; and bestowed the highestcommendations upon the soldiers, because, though they had received twosuch disastrous blows in succession, they had retained possession ofthe province, and not allowing the enemy to reap any advantage fromtheir successes, had excluded them entirely from the territory on thisside of the Iberus, and honourably protected their allies. Marcius hekept with him, and treated him with such respect, that it wasperfectly evident there was nothing he feared less than lest any oneshould stand in the way of his own glory. Silanus then took the placeof Nero, and the fresh troops were led into winter quarters. Scipiohaving in good time visited every place where his presence wasnecessary, and completed every thing which was to be done, returned toTarraco. The reputation of Scipio among his enemies was not inferiorto that which he enjoyed among his allies and countrymen. They feltalso a kind of presentiment of what was to come, which occasioned thegreater apprehension, the less they could account for their fears,which had arisen without any cause. They had retired to their winterquarters in different directions. Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, had gonequite to the ocean and Gades; Mago into the midland parts chieflyabove the forest of Castulo; Hasdrubal, son of Hamilcar, wintered inthe neighbourhood of Saguntum, close upon the Iberus. At the close ofthe summer in which Capua was recovered and Scipio entered Spain, aCarthaginian fleet, which had been fetched from Sicily to Tarentum, tocut off the supplies of the Roman garrison in the citadel of thatplace, had blocked up all the approaches to the citadel from the sea;but by lying there too long, they caused a greater scarcity ofprovisions to their friends than to their enemies. For so much corncould not be brought in for the townsmen, along the coasts which werefriendly to them, and through the ports which were kept open throughthe protection afforded by the Carthaginian fleet, as the fleet itselfconsumed, which had on board a crowd made up of every description ofpersons. So that the garrison of the citadel, which was small innumber, could be supported from the stock they had previously laid inwithout importing any, while that which they imported was notsufficient for the supply of the Tarentines and the fleet. At lengththe fleet was sent away with greater satisfaction than it wasreceived. The scarcity of provisions, however, was not much relievedby it; because when the protection by sea was removed corn could notbe brought in."Book 26,Chapter 21,"At the close of the same summer, Marcus Marcellus arriving at thecity from his province of Sicily, an audience of the senate was givenhim by Caius Calpurnius, the praetor, in the temple of Bellona. Here,after discoursing on the services he had performed, and complaining ingentle terms, not on his own account more than that of his soldiers,that after having completely reduced the province, he had not beenallowed to bring home his army, he requested that he might be allowedto enter the city in triumph; this he did not obtain. A long debatetook place on the question, whether it was less consistent to deny atriumph on his return to him, in whose name, when absent, asupplication had been decreed and honours paid to the immortal gods,for successes obtained under his conduct; or, when they had orderedhim to deliver over his army to a successor, which would not have beendecreed unless there were still war in the province, to allow him totriumph, as if the war had been terminated, when the army, theevidence of the triumph being deserved or undeserved, were absent. Asa middle course between the two opinions, it was resolved that heshould enter the city in ovation. The plebeian tribunes, by directionof the senate, proposed to the people, that Marcus Marcellus should beinvested with command during the day on which he should enter the cityin ovation. The day before he entered the city he triumphed on theAlban mount; after which he entered the city in ovation, having agreat quantity of spoils carried before him, together with a model ofthe capture of Syracuse. The catapultas and ballistas, and every otherinstrument of war were carried; likewise the rich ornaments laid up byits kings during a long continuance of peace; a quantity of wroughtsilver and brass, and other articles, with precious garments, and anumber of celebrated statues, with which Syracuse had been adorned insuch a manner as to rank among the chief Grecian cities in thatrespect. Eight elephants were also led as an emblem of victory overthe Carthaginians. Sosis, the Syracusan, and Mericus, the Spaniard,who preceded him with golden crowns, formed not the least interestingpart of the spectacle; under the guidance of one of whom the Romanshad entered Syracuse by night, while the other had betrayed to themthe island and the garrison in it. To both of them the freedom of thecity was given, and five hundred acres of land each. Sosis was to havehis portion in the Syracusan territory, out of the lands which hadbelonged either to the kings or the enemies of the Roman people,together with a house at Syracuse, which had belonged to any one ofthose persons who had been punished according to the laws of war.Mericus and the Spaniards who had come over with him were ordered tohave a city and lands assigned to them in Sicily, which had belongedto some of those who had revolted from the Romans. It was given incharge to Marcus Cornelius to assign them the city and lands whereverhe thought proper. In the same country, four hundred acres of landwere decreed to Belligenes, by whose means Mericus had been persuadedto come over. After the departure of Marcellus from Sicily, aCarthaginian fleet landed eight thousand infantry and three thousandNumidian cavalry. To these the Murgantian territories revolted; Hybla,Macella, and certain other towns of less note followed theirdefection. The Numidians also, headed by Mutines, ranging withoutrestraint through the whole of Sicily, ravaged with fire the lands ofthe allies of the Romans. In addition to these unfortunatecircumstances, the Roman soldiers, incensed partly because they hadnot been taken from the province with their general, and partlybecause they had been forbidden to winter in towns, discharged theirduties negligently, and wanted a a leader more than inclination for amutiny. Amid these difficulties Marcus Cornelius, the praetor,sometimes by soothing, at other times by reproving them, pacified theminds of the soldiers; and reduced to obedience all the states whichhad revolted; out of which he gave Murgantia to those Spaniards whowere entitled to a city and land, in conformity with the decree of thesenate."Book 26,Chapter 22,"As both the consuls had Apulia for their province, and as therewas now less to be apprehended from Hannibal and the Carthaginians,they were directed to draw lots for the provinces of Apulia andMacedonia. Macedonia fell to the lot of Sulpicius, who succeededLaevinus. Fulvius having been called to Rome on account of theelection, held an assembly to elect new consuls; when the juniorVeturian century, which had the right of voting first, named TitusManlius Torquatus and Titus Otacilius. A crowd collecting roundManlius, who was present, to congratulate him, and it being certainthat the people would concur in his election, he went, surrounded ashe was with a multitude of persons, to the tribunal of the consul, andrequested that he would listen to a few words from him; and that hewould order the century which had voted to be recalled. While allpresent were waiting impatiently to hear what it was he was going toask, he alleged as an excuse the weakness of his eyes; observing, that""a pilot or a general might fairly be charged with presumption whoshould request that the lives and fortunes of others might beintrusted to him, when in every thing which was to be done he mustmake use of other people's eyes. Therefore he requested, that, if itseemed good to him, he would order the junior Veturian century to comeand vote again; and to recollect, while electing consuls, the warwhich they had in Italy, and the present exigencies of the state. Thattheir ears had scarcely yet ceased to ring with the noise and tumultraised by the enemy, when but a few months ago they nearly scaled thewalls of Rome."" This speech was followed by the century's shoutingout, one and all, that ""they would not in the least alter their vote,but would name the same persons for consuls;"" when Torquatus replied,""neither shall I as consul be able to put up with your conduct, norwill you be satisfied with my government. Go back and vote again, andconsider that you have a Punic war in Italy, and that the leader ofyour enemies is Hannibal."" Upon this the century, moved by theauthority of the man and the shouts of admirers around, besought theconsul to summon the elder Veturian century; for they were desirous ofconferring with persons older than themselves, and to name the consulsin accordance with their advice. The elder Veturian century havingbeen summoned, time was allowed them to confer with the others bythemselves in the _ovile_. The elders said that there were threepersons whom they ought to deliberate about electing, two of themhaving already served all the offices of honour, namely, QuintusFabius and Marcus Marcellus; and if they wished so particularly toelect some fresh person as consul to act against the Carthaginians,that Marcus Valerius Laevinus had carried on operations against kingPhilip by sea and land with signal success. Thus, three persons havingbeen proposed to them to deliberate about, the seniors were dismissed,and the juniors proceeded to vote. They named as consuls, MarcusClaudius Marcellus, then glorious with the conquest of Sicily, andMarcus Valerius, both in their absence. All the centuries followed therecommendation of that which voted first. Let men now ridicule theadmirers of antiquity. Even if there existed a republic of wise men,which the learned rather imagine than know of; for my own part Icannot persuade myself that there could possibly be a nobility ofsounder judgment, and more moderate in their desire of power, or apeople better moralled. Indeed that a century of juniors should havebeen willing to consult their elders, as to the persons to whom theyshould intrust a command by their vote, is rendered scarcely probableby the contempt and levity with which the parental authority istreated by children in the present age."Book 26,Chapter 23,"The assembly for the election of praetors was then held, at whichPublius Manlius Vulso, Lucius Manlius Acidinus, Caius Laetorius, andLucius Cincius Alimentus were elected. It happened that just as theelections were concluded, news was brought that Titus Otacilius, whomit seemed the people would have made consul in his absence, with TitusManlius, had not the course of the elections been interrupted, haddied in Sicily. The games in honour of Apollo had been performed thepreceding year, and on the motion of Calpurnius, the praetor, thatthey should be performed this year also, the senate decreed that theyshould be vowed every year for the time to come. The same year severalprodigies were seen and reported. At the temple of Concord, a statueof Victory, which stood on the roof, having been struck by lightningand thrown down, stuck among the figures of Victory, which were amongthe ornaments under the eaves, and did not fall to the ground fromthence. Both from Anagnia and Fregellae it was reported that a walland some gates had been struck by lightning. That in the forum ofSudertum streams of blood had continued flowing through a whole day;at Eretum, that there had been a shower of stones; and at Reate, thata mule had brought forth. These prodigies were expiated with victimsof the larger sort, the people were commanded to offer up prayers forone day, and perform the nine days' sacred rite. Several of the publicpriests died off this year, and fresh ones were appointed. In the roomof Manius Aemilius Numida, decemvir for sacred rites, Marcus AemiliusLepidus was appointed; in the room of Manius Pomponius Matho, thepontiff, Caius Livius; in the room of Spurius Carvilius Maximus, theaugur, Marcus Servilius. As Titus Otacilius Crassus, a pontiff, diedafter the year was concluded, no person was nominated to succeed him.Caius Claudius, flamen of Jupiter, retired from his office, because hehad distributed the entrails improperly."Book 26,Chapter 24,"During the same time Marcus Valerius Laevinus, having firstsounded the intentions of the leading men by means of secretconferences, came with some light ships to a council of the Aetolians,which had been previously appointed to meet for this very purpose.Here having proudly pointed to the capture of Syracuse and Capua, asproofs of the success of the Roman arms in Sicily and Italy, he added,that ""it was a custom with the Romans, handed down to them from theirancestors, to respect their allies; some of whom they had receivedinto their state, and had admitted to the same privileges they enjoyedthemselves, while others they treated so favourably that they choserather to be allies than citizens. That the Aetolians would behonoured by them so much the more, because they were the first of thenations across the sea which had entered into friendship with them.That Philip and the Macedonians were troublesome neighbours to them,but that he had broken their strength and spirits already, and wouldstill further reduce them to that degree, that they should not onlyevacuate the cities which they had violently taken from the Aetolians,but have Macedonia itself disturbed with war. And that as to theAcarnanians, whose separation from their body was a source of grief tothe Aetolians, he would place them again under their ancient system ofjurisdiction and dominion."" These assertions and promises of the Romangeneral, Scopas, who was at that time praetor of the nation, andDorymachus, a leading man among the Aetolians, confirmed on their ownauthority, extolling the power and greatness of the Roman people withless reserve, and with greater force of conviction. However, the hopeof recovering Acarnania principally moved them. The terms, therefore,were reduced to writing, on which they should enter into alliance andfriendship with the Roman people, and it was added, that ""if it wereagreeable to them and they wished it, the Eleans and Lacedaemonians,with Attalus, Pleuratus, and Scerdilaedas, should be included on thesame conditions."" Attalus was king of Asia; the latter, kings of theThracians and Illyrians. The conditions were, that ""the Aetoliansshould immediately make war on Philip by land, in which the Romansshould assist, with not less than twenty quinqueremes. That the siteand buildings, together with the walls and lands, of all the cities asfar as Corcyra, should become the property of the Aetolians, everyother kind of booty, of the Romans. That the Romans should endeavourto put the Aetolians in possession of Acarnania. If the Aetoliansshould make peace with Philip, they should insert a stipulation thatthe peace should stand good only on condition that they abstained fromhostilities against the Romans, their allies, and the states subjectto them. In like manner, if the Romans should form an alliance withthe king, that they should provide that he should not have liberty tomake war upon the Aetolians and their allies."" Such were the termsagreed upon; and copies of them having been made, they were laid uptwo years afterwards by the Aetolians at Olympia, and by the Romans inthe Capitol, that they might be attested by these consecrated records.The delay had been occasioned by the Aetolian ambassadors' having beendetained at Rome. This, however, did not form an impediment to thewar's proceeding. Both the Aetolians immediately commenced war againstPhilip, and Laevinus taking, all but the citadel, Zacynthus, a smallisland near to Aetolia, and having one city of the same name with theisland; and also taking Aeniadae and Nasus from the Acarnanians,annexed them to the Aetolians; and also considering that Philip wassufficiently engaged in war with his neighbours to prevent histhinking of Italy, the Carthaginians, and his compact with Hannibal,he retired to Corcyra."Book 26,Chapter 25,"To Philip intelligence of the defection of the Aetolians wasbrought while in winter quarters at Pella. As he was about to march anarmy into Greece at the beginning of the spring, he undertook a suddenexpedition into the territories of Oricum and Apollonia, in order thatMacedonia might not be molested by the Illyrians, and the citiesbordering upon them, in consequence of the terror he would thus strikethem with in turn. The Apollonians came out to oppose him, but hedrove them, terrified and dismayed, within their walls. Afterdevastating the adjacent parts of Illyricum he turned his course intoPelagonia, with the same expedition. He then took Sintia, a town ofthe Dardanians, which would have afforded them a passage intoMacedonia. Having with the greatest despatch performed theseachievements, not forgetting the war made upon him by the Aetoliansand Romans in conjunction, he marched down into Thessaly throughPelagonia, Lyncus, and Bottiaea. He trusted that people might beinduced to take part with him in the war against the Aetolians, and,therefore, leaving Perseus with four thousand armed men at the gorge,which formed the entrance into Thessaly, to prevent the Aetolians frompassing it, before he should be occupied with more important business,he marched his army into Macedonia, and thence into Thrace andMaedica. This nation had been accustomed to make incursions intoMacedonia when they perceived the king engaged in a foreign war, andthe kingdom left unprotected. Accordingly, he began to devastate thelands in the neighbourhood of Phragandae, and to lay siege to the cityJamphorina, the capital and chief fortress of Maedica. Scopas, onhearing that the king had gone into Thrace, and was engaged in a warthere, armed all the Aetolian youths, and prepared to invadeAcarnania. The Acarnanian nation, unequal to their enemy in point ofstrength, and seeing that they had lost Aeniadae and Nasus, andmoreover that the Roman arms were threatening them, prepare the warrather with rage than prudence. Having sent their wives, children, andthose who were above sixty years old into the neighbouring parts ofEpirus, all who were between the ages of fifteen and sixty, bound eachother by an oath not to return unless victorious. That no one mightreceive into his city or house, or admit to his table or hearth, suchas should retire from the field vanquished, they drew up a form ofdireful execration against their countrymen who should do so; and themost solemn entreaty they could devise, to friendly states. At thesame time they entreated the Epirotes to bury in one tomb such oftheir men as should fall in the encounter, adding this inscriptionover their remains: HERE LIE THE ACARNANIANS, WHO DIED WHILE FIGHTINGIN DEFENCE OF THEIR COUNTRY, AGAINST THE VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE OF THEAETOLIANS. Having worked up their courage to the highest pitch bythese means, they fixed their camp at the extreme borders of theircountry in the way of the enemy; and sending messengers to Philip toinform him of the critical situation in which they stood, they obligedhim to suspend the war in which he was engaged, though he had gainedpossession of Jamphorina by surrender, and had succeeded in otherrespects. The ardour of the Aetolians was damped, in the firstinstance, by the news of the combination formed by the Acarnanians;but afterwards the intelligence of Philip's approach compelled themeven to retreat into the interior of the country. Nor did Philipproceed farther than Dium, though he had marched with great expeditionto prevent the Acarnanians being overpowered; and when he had receivedinformation that the Aetolians had returned out of Acarnania, he alsoreturned to Pella."Book 26,Chapter 26,"Laevinus set sail from Corcyra in the beginning of the spring, anddoubling the promontory Leucate, arrived at Naupactus; when he gavenotice that he should go thence to Anticyra, in order that Scopas andthe Aetolians might be ready there to join him. Anticyra is situatedin Locris, on the left hand as you enter the Corinthian Gulf. Thedistance between Naupactus and this place is short both by sea andland. In about three days after, the attack upon this place commencedon both elements. The attack from the sea produced the greatesteffect, because there were on board the ships engines and machines ofevery description, and because the Romans besieged from that quarter.In a few days, therefore, the town surrendered, and was delivered overto the Aetolians, the booty, according to compact, was given up to theRomans. Laevinus then received a letter informing him, that he hadbeen elected consul in his absence, and that Publius Sulpicius wascoming as his successor. He arrived at Rome later than he wasgenerally expected, being detained by a lingering illness. MarcusMarcellus, having entered upon the consulship on the ides of March,assembled the senate on that day merely for form's sake He declared,that ""in the absence of his colleague he would not enter into anyquestion relative to the state or the provinces."" He said, ""he wellknew there were crowds of Sicilians in the neighbourhood of the cityat the country-houses of those who maligned him, whom he was so farfrom wishing to prevent from openly publishing, at Rome, the chargeswhich had been circulated and got up against him by his enemies, thatdid they not pretend that they entertained some fear of speaking of aconsul in the absence of his colleague, he would forthwith have giventhem a hearing of the senate. That when his colleague had arrived, hewould not allow any business to be transacted before the Sicilianswere brought before the senate. That Marcus Cornelius had in a mannerheld a levy throughout all Sicily, in order that as many as possiblemight come to Rome to prefer complaints against him, that the sameperson had filled the city with letters containing falserepresentations that there was still war in Sicily, in order todetract from his merit."" The consul, having acquired on that day thereputation of having a well-regulated mind, dismissed the senate, andit appeared that there would be almost a total suspension of everykind of business till the other consul returned to the city. The wantof employment, as usual, produced expressions of discontent among thepeople. They complained of the length of the war, that the landsaround the city were devastated wherever Hannibal had marched hishostile troops; that Italy was exhausted by levies, and that almostevery year their armies were cut to pieces, that the consuls electedwere both of them fond of war, men over-enterprising and impetuous,who would probably stir up war in a time of profound peace, andtherefore were the less likely to allow the state to breathe in timeof war."Book 26,Chapter 27,"A fire which broke out in several places at once in theneighbourhood of the forum, on the night before the festival ofMinerva, interrupted these discourses. Seven shops, where five wereafterwards erected, and the banks, which are now called the new banks,were all on fire at once. Afterwards the private dwellings caught, forthere were no public halls there then, the prisons called the Quarry,the fish-market, and the royal palace. The temple of Vesta was withdifficulty saved, principally by the exertions of thirteen slaves, whowere redeemed at the public expense and manumitted. The fire continuedfor a day and a night. It was evident to every body that it was causedby human contrivance, because the flames burst forth in several placesat once, and those at a distance from each other. The consul,therefore, on the recommendation of the senate, publicly notified,that whoever should make known by whose act the conflagration waskindled, should rewarded, if a free-man, with money, if a slave, withliberty. Induced by this reward, a slave of the Campanian family, theCalavii, named Mannus, gave information that ""his masters, with fivenoble Campanian youths, whose parents had been executed by Fulvius,were the authors of the fire, and that they would commit various otheracts of the same kind if they were not seized."" Upon this they wereseized, as well as their slaves. At first, the informer and hisevidence were disparaged, for that ""he had run away from his mastersthe day before in consequence of a whipping, and that from an eventwhich had happened by mere chance, he had fabricated this charge, fromresentment and wantonness."" But when they were charged by theiraccusers face to face, and the ministers of their villanies begin tobe examined in the middle of the forum, they all confessed, andpunishment was inflicted upon the masters and their accessory slaves.The informer received his liberty and twenty thousand _asses_.The consul Laevinus, while passing by Capua, was surrounded by amultitude of Campanians, who besought him, with tears, that they mightbe permitted to go to Rome to the senate, so that if they could atlength be in any degree moved by compassion, they might not carrytheir resentment so far as to destroy them utterly, nor suffer thevery name of the Campanian nation to be obliterated by QuintusFlaccus. Flaccus declared, that ""he had individually no quarrel withthe Campanians, but that he did entertain an enmity towards them onpublic grounds and because they were foes, and should continue to doso as long as he felt assured that they had the same feelings towardsthe Roman people; for that there was no nation or people on earth moreinveterate against the Roman name. That his reason for keeping themshut up within their walls was, that if any of these got out any wherethey roamed through the country like wild beasts, tearing andmassacring whatever fell in their way. That some of them had desertedto Hannibal, others had gone and set fire to Rome; that the consulwould find the traces of the villany of the Campanians in thehalf-burnt forum. That the temple of Vesta, the eternal fire, and thefatal pledge for the continuance of the Roman empire deposited in theshrine, had been the objects of their attack. That in his opinion itwas extremely unsafe for any Campanians to be allowed to enter thewalls of Rome."" Laevinus ordered the Campanians to follow him to Rome,after Flaccus had bound them by an oath to return to Capua on thefifth day after receiving an answer from the senate. Surrounded bythis crowd, and followed also by the Sicilians and Aeolians, who cameout to meet him, he went to Rome; taking with him into the city asaccusers of two men who had acquired the greatest celebrity by theoverthrow of two most renowned cities, those whom they had vanquishedin war. Both the consuls, however, first proposed to the senate theconsideration of the state of the commonwealth, and the arrangementsrespecting the provinces."Book 26,Chapter 28,"On this occasion Laevinus reported the state of Macedonia andGreece, of the Aetolians, Acarnanians, and Locrians, and the serviceshe had himself performed there on sea and land. That ""Philip, who wasbringing an army against the Aetolians, had been driven back by himinto Macedonia, and compelled to retire into the heart of his kingdom.That the legion might therefore be withdrawn from that quarter, andthat the fleet was sufficient to keep the king out of Italy."" Thusmuch he said respecting himself and the province where he hadcommanded. The consuls jointly proposed the consideration of theprovinces, when the senate decreed, that, ""Italy and the war withHannibal should form the province of one of the consuls; that theother should have the command of the fleet which Titus Otacilius hadcommanded, and the province of Sicily, in conjunction with LuciusCincius, the praetor."" The two armies decreed to them were those inEtruria and Gaul, consisting of four legions. That the two citylegions of the former year should be sent into Etruria and the twowhich Sulpicius, the consul, had commanded, into Gaul; that he shouldhave the command of Gaul, and the legions there whom the consul, whohad the province of Italy, should appoint. Caius Calpurnius, havinghis command continued to him for a year after the expiration of hispraetorship, was sent into Etruria. To Quintus Fulvius also theprovince of Capua was decreed, with his command continued for a year.The army of citizens and allies was ordered to be reduced, so that,out of two, one legion should be formed consisting of five thousandfoot and three hundred horse, those being discharged who had servedthe greatest number of campaigns. That of the allies there should beleft seven thousand infantry and three hundred horse, the same rulebeing observed with regard to the periods of their service indischarging the old soldiers. With Cneius Fulvius, the consul of theformer year, no change was made touching his province of Apulia norhis army; only he was continued in command for a year. PubliusSulpicius, his colleague, was ordered to discharge the whole of hisarmy excepting the marines. It was ordered also, that the army whichMarcus Cornelius had commanded, should be sent out of Sicily as soonas the consul arrived in his province. The soldiers which had foughtat Cannae, amounting to two legions, were assigned to Lucius Cincius,the praetor, for the occupation of Sicily. As many legions wereassigned to Publius Manlius Vulso, the praetor, for Sardinia, beingthose which Lucius Cornelius had commanded in that province the formeryear. The consuls were directed so to raise legions for the service ofthe city, as not to enlist any one who had served in the armies ofMarcus Claudius, Marcus Valerius, or Quintus Fulvius, so that theRoman legions might not exceed twenty-one that year."Book 26,Chapter 29,"After the senate had passed these decrees, the consuls drew lotsfor their provinces. Sicily and the fleet fell to the lot ofMarcellus; Italy, with the war against Hannibal, to Laevinus. Thisresult so terrified the Sicilians, who were standing in sight of theconsuls waiting the determination of the lots, that their bitterlamentations and mournful cries both drew upon them the eyes of all atthe time, and afterwards furnished matter for conversation. For theywent round to the several senators in mourning garments, affirming,that ""they would not only abandon, each of them, his native country,but all Sicily, if Marcellus should again go thither with command.That he had formerly been implacable toward them for no demerit oftheirs, what would he do now, when exasperated that they had come toRome to complain of him? That it would be better for that island to beoverwhelmed with the fires of Aetna, or sunk in the sea, than to bedelivered up, as it were, for execution to an enemy."" These complaintsof the Sicilians, having been carried round to the houses of thenobility, and frequently canvassed in conversations, which wereprompted partly by compassion for the Sicilians and partly by dislikefor Marcellus, at length reached the senate also. The consuls wererequested to take the sense of the senate on an exchange of provinces.Marcellus said, that ""if the Sicilians had already had an audience ofthe senate, his opinion perhaps might have been different, but as thecase now stood, lest any one should be able to say that they wereprevented by fear from freely venting their complaints respecting him,to whose power they were presently about to be subject, he waswilling, if it made no difference to his colleague, to exchangeprovinces with him. That he deprecated a premature decision on thepart of the senate, for since it would be unjust that his colleagueshould have the power of selecting his province without drawing lots,how much greater injustice would it be, nay, rather indignity, for hislot to be transferred to him."" Accordingly the senate, having rathershown than decreed what they wished, adjourned. An exchange ofprovinces was made by the consuls of themselves, fate hurrying onMarcellus to encounter Hannibal, that he might be the last of theRoman generals, who, by his fall, when the affairs of the war weremost prosperous, might add to the glory of that man, from whom hederived the reputation of having been the first Roman general whodefeated him."Book 26,Chapter 30,"After the provinces had been exchanged, the Sicilians, on beingintroduced into the senate, discoursed largely on the constantfidelity of king Hiero to the Roman people, converting it into apublic merit. They said, ""that the tyrants, Hieronymus, and, afterhim, Hippocrates and Epicydes, had been objects of detestation tothem, both on other accounts and especially on account of thendeserting the Romans to take part with Hannibal. For this causeHieronymus was put to death by the principal young men among them,almost with the public concurrence, and a conspiracy was formed tomurder Epicydes and Hippocrates, by seventy of the most distinguishedof their youth; but being left without support in consequence of thedelay of Marcellus, who neglected to bring up his troops to Syracuseat the time agreed upon, they were all, on an indictment that wasmade, put to death by the tyrants. That Marcellus, by the crueltyexercised in the sacking of Leontini, had given occasion to thetyranny of Hippocrates and Epicydes. From that time the leading menamong the Syracusans never ceased going over to Marcellus, andpromising him that they would deliver the city to him whenever hepleased; but that he, in the first instance, was disposed rather totake it by force, and afterwards, finding it impossible to effect hisobject by sea or land, after trying every means, he preferred havingSyracuse delivered to him by Sosis, a brazier, and Mericus, aSpaniard, to receiving it from the principal men of Syracuse, who hadso often offered it to him voluntarily to no purpose; doubtless inorder that he might with a fairer pretext butcher and plunder the mostancient allies of the Roman people. If it had not been Hieronymus whorevolted to Hannibal, but the people and senate of Syracuse; if thebody of the Syracusan people, and not their tyrants, Hippocrates andEpicydes, who held them in thraldom, had closed the gates againstMarcellus; if they had carried on war with the Roman people with theanimosity of Carthaginians, what more could Marcellus have done inhostility than he did, without levelling Syracuse with the ground?Nothing indeed was left at Syracuse except the walls and gutted housesof her city, the temples of her gods broken open and plundered; hervery gods and their ornaments having been carried away. From manytheir possessions also were taken away, so that they were unable tosupport themselves and their families, even from the naked soil, theonly remains of their plundered property. They entreated the conscriptfathers, that they would order, if not all, at least such of theirproperty as could be found and identified, to be restored to theowners."" After they had made these complaints, Laevinus ordered themto withdraw from the senate-house, that the senate might deliberate ontheir requests, when Marcellus exclaimed, ""Nay, rather let them stayhere, that I may reply to their charges in their presence, since weconduct your wars for you, conscript fathers, on the condition ofhaving as our accusers those whom we have conquered with our arms. Ofthe two cities which have been captured this year, let Capua arraignFulvius, and Syracuse Marcellus."""Book 26,Chapter 31,"The deputies having been brought back into the senate-house, theconsul said: ""I am not so unmindful of the dignity of the Roman peopleand of the office I fill as consul, conscript fathers, as to make adefence against charges brought by Greeks, had the inquiry relatedonly to my own delinquency. But it is not so much what I have done, aswhat they deserved to suffer, which comes into dispute. For if theywere not our enemies, there was no difference between sacking Syracusethen, and when Hiero was alive. But if, on the other hand, they haverenounced their connexion with us, attacked our ambassadors sword inhand, shut us out of their city and walls, and defended themselvesagainst us with an army of Carthaginians, who can feel indignant thatthey should suffer the hostilities they have offered? I turned awayfrom the leading men of the Syracusans, when they were desirous ofdelivering up the city to me, and esteemed Sosis and Mericus as moreproper persons for so important an affair. Now you are not the meanestof the Syracusans, who reproach others with the meanness of theircondition. But who is there among you, who has promised that he wouldopen the gates to me, and receive my armed troops within the city? Youhate and execrate those who did so; and not even here can you abstainfrom speaking with insult of them; so far is it from being the casethat you would yourselves have done any thing of the kind. The verymeanness of the condition of those persons, conscript fathers, withwhich these men reproach them, forms the strongest proof that I didnot turn away from any man who was willing to render a service to ourstate. Before I began the siege of Syracuse I attempted a peace, atone time by sending ambassadors, at another time by going to conferwith them; and after that they refrained not from laying violent handson my ambassadors, nor would give me an answer when I held aninterview with their chief men at their gates, then, at length, aftersuffering many hardships by sea and land, I took Syracuse by force ofarms. Of what befell them after their city was captured they wouldcomplain with more justice to Hannibal, the Carthaginians, and thosewho were vanquished with them, than to the senate of the victoriouspeople. If, conscript fathers, I had intended to conceal the fact thatI had despoiled Syracuse, I should never have decorated the city ofRome with her spoils. As to what things I either took from individualsor bestowed upon them, as conqueror, I feel assured that I have actedagreeably to the laws of war, and the deserts of each. That you shouldconfirm what I have done, conscript fathers, certainly concerns thecommonwealth more than myself, since I have discharged my dutyfaithfully; but it is the duty of the state to take care, lest, byrescinding my acts, they should render other commanders for the timeto come less zealous. And since, conscript fathers, you have heardboth what the Sicilians and I had to say, in the presence of eachother, we will go out of the senate-house together, in order that inmy absence the senate may deliberate more freely."" Accordingly, theSicilians having been dismissed, he himself also went away to theCapitol to levy soldiers."Book 26,Chapter 32,"The other consul then proposed to the fathers the consideration ofthe requests of the Sicilians, when a long debate took place. A greatpart of the senate acquiesced in an opinion which originated withTitus Manlius Torquatus, ""that the war ought to have been carried onagainst the tyrants, the enemies both of the Syracusans and the Romanpeople; that the city ought to have been recovered, not captured; and,when recovered, should have been firmly established under its ancientlaws and liberty, and not distressed by war, when worn out with awretched state of bondage. That in the contest between the tyrants andthe Roman general, that most beautiful and celebrated city, formerlythe granary and treasury of the Roman people, which was held up as thereward of the victor, had been destroyed; a city by whose munificenceand bounty the commonwealth had been assisted and adorned on manyoccasions, and lastly, during this very Punic war. Should king Hiero,that most faithful friend of the Roman empire, rise from the shades,with what face could either Syracuse or Rome be shown to him, when,after beholding his half-demolished and plundered native city, heshould see, on entering Rome, the spoils of his country in thevestibule, as it were, of the city, and almost in the very gates?""Although these and other similar things were said, to throw odium uponthe consul and excite compassion for the Sicilians, yet the fathers,out of regard for Marcellus, passed a milder decree, to the effect,""that what Marcellus had done while prosecuting the war, and whenvictorious, should be confirmed. That for the time to come, the senatewould look to the affairs of Syracuse, and would give it in charge tothe consul Laevinus, to consult the interest of that state, so far asit could be done without detriment to the commonwealth."" Two senatorshaving been sent to the Capitol to request the consul to return to thesenate-house, and the Sicilians having been called in, the decree ofthe senate was read. The deputies were addressed in terms of kindness,and dismissed, when they threw themselves at the knees of the consul,Marcellus, beseeching him to pardon them for what they had said forthe purpose of exciting compassion, and procuring relief from theircalamities, and to receive themselves and the city of Syracuse underhis protection and patronage; after which, the consul addressed themkindly and dismissed them."Book 26,Chapter 33,"An audience of the senate was then granted to the Campanians.Their speech was more calculated to excite compassion, but their caseless favourable, for neither could they deny that they deserved thepunishment they had suffered, nor were there any tyrants to whom theycould transfer their guilt. But they trusted that sufficient atonementhad been made by the death of so many of their senators by poison andthe hands of the executioner. They said, ""that a few only of theirnobles remained, being such as were not induced by the consciousnessof their demerit to adopt any desperate measure respecting themselves,and had not been condemned to death through the resentment of theirconquerors. That these implored the restoration of their liberty, andsome portion of their goods for themselves and families, beingcitizens of Rome, and most of them connected with the Romans byaffinity and now too near relationship, in consequence ofintermarriages which had taken place for a long period."" After thisthey were removed from the senate-house, when for a short time doubtswere entertained whether it would be right or not to send for QuintusFulvius from Capua, (for Claudius, the proconsul, died after thecapture of that place,) that the question might be canvassed in thepresence of the general who had been concerned, as was done in theaffair between Marcellus and the Sicilians. But afterwards, when theysaw in the senate Marcus Atilius, and Caius Fulvius, the brother ofFlaccus, his lieutenant-generals, and Quintus Minucius, and LuciusVeturius Philo, who were also his lieutenant-generals, who had beenpresent at every transaction; and being unwilling that Fulvius shouldbe recalled from Capua, or the Campanians put off, Marcus AtiliusRegulus, who possessed the greatest weight of any of those present whohad been at Capua, being asked his opinion, thus spoke: ""I believe Iassisted at the council held by the consuls after the capture ofCapua, when inquiry was made whether any of the Campanians haddeserved well of our state; and it was found that two women had doneso; Vestia Oppia, a native of Atella and an inhabitant of Capua, andFaucula Cluvia, formerly a common woman. The former had daily offeredsacrifice for the safety and success of the Roman people, and thelatter had clandestinely supplied the starving prisoners with food.The sentiments of all the rest of the Campanians towards us had beenthe same,"" he said, ""as those of the Carthaginians; and those who hadbeen decapitated by Fulvius, were the most conspicuous in rank, butnot in guilt. I do not see,"" said he, ""how the senate can deciderespecting the Campanians who are Roman citizens, without an order ofthe people. And the course adopted by our ancestors, in the case ofthe Satricani when they had revolted, was, that Marcus Antistius, theplebeian tribune, should first propose and the commons make an order,that the senate should have the power of pronouncing judgment upon theSatricani. I therefore give it as my opinion, that application shouldbe made to the plebeian tribunes, that one or more of them shouldpropose to the people a bill, by which we may be empowered todetermine in the case of the Campanians."" Lucius Atilius, plebeiantribune, proposed to the people, on the recommendation of the senate,a bill to the following effect: ""Concerning all the Campanians,Atellanians, Calatinians, and Sabatinians, who have surrenderedthemselves to the proconsul Fulvius, and have placed themselves underthe authority and dominion of the Roman people; also concerning whatthings they have surrendered, together with their persons, both landsand city, divine or human, together with their utensils and whatsoeverelse they have surrendered; concerning these things, Roman citizens, Iask you what it is your pleasure should be done."" The commons thusordered: ""Whatsoever the senate on oath, or the majority of thosepresent, may determine, that we will and order."""Book 26,Chapter 34,"The senate having taken the matter into their consideration inconformity with this order of the people, first restored to Oppia andCluvia their goods and liberty; directing, that if they wished tosolicit any other rewards from the senate, they should come to Rome.Separate decrees were passed respecting each of the Campanianfamilies, all of which it is not worth while to enumerate. The goodsof some were to be confiscated; themselves, their children, and theirwives were to be sold, excepting such of their daughters as hadmarried before they came into the power of the Roman people. Otherswere ordered to be thrown into chains, and their cases to beconsidered at a future time. They made the amount of income the groundon which they decided, whether the goods of the rest of the Campaniansshould be confiscated or not. They voted, that all the cattle takenexcept the horses, all the slaves except adult males, and every thingwhich did not belong to the soil, should be restored to the owners.They ordered that all the Campanians, Atellanians, Calatinians, andSabatinians, except such as were themselves, or whose parents were,among the enemy, should be free, with a proviso, that none of themshould become a Roman citizen or a Latin confederate; and that none ofthose who had been at Capua while the gates were shut should remain inthe city or territory of Capua after a certain day. That a placeshould be assigned to them to inhabit beyond the Tiber, but notcontiguous to it. That those who had neither been in Capua nor in anyCampanian city which had revolted from the Romans during the war,should inhabit a place on this side the river Liris towards Rome; andthat those who had come over to the Romans before Hannibal arrived atCapua, should be removed to a place on this side the Vulturnus, with aproviso, that none of them should have either land or house withinfifteen miles of the sea. That such of them as were removed to a placebeyond the Tiber, should neither themselves nor their posterityacquire or possess any property any where, except in the Veientian,Sutrian, or Nepetian territories; and, except on condition, that noone should possess a greater extent of land than fifty acres. That thegoods of all the senators, and such as had been magistrates at Capua,Calatia, and Atella, should be sold at Capua; but that the freepersons who were decreed to be exposed to sale, should be sent to Romeand sold there. As to the images and brazen statues, which were saidto have been taken from the enemy, whether sacred or profane, theyreferred them to the college of pontiffs. They sent the Campaniansaway, considerably more grieved than they were when they came, inconsequence of these decrees; and now they no longer complained of theseverity of Quintus Fulvius towards them, but of the malignity of thegods and their own accursed fortune."Book 26,Chapter 35,"After the Sicilians and Campanians were dismissed, a levy wasmade; and after the troops had been enlisted for the army, they thenbegan to consider about making up the number of rowers; but as therewas neither a sufficient supply of men for that purpose, nor any moneyat that time in the treasury by which they might be purchased or paid,the consuls issued an edict, that private persons should furnishrowers in proportion to their income and rank, as had been donebefore, with pay and provisions for thirty days. So great was themurmuring and indignation of the people, on account of this edict,that a leader, rather than matter, was wanting for an insurrection. Itwas said, that ""the consuls, after having ruined the Sicilians andCampanians, had undertaken to destroy and lacerate the Roman commons;that, drained as they had been for so many years by taxes, they hadnothing left but wasted and naked lands. That the enemy had burnedtheir houses, and the state had taken away their slaves, who were thecultivators of their lands, at one time by purchasing them at a lowrate for soldiers, at another by commanding a supply of rowers. If anyone had any silver or brass it was taken away from him, for thepayment of rowers or for annual taxes. That no force could compel andno command oblige them to give what they had not got. That they mightsell their goods and then vent their cruelty on their persons, whichwere all that remained to them. That they had nothing even left fromwhich they could be redeemed."" These complaints were uttered not insecret, but publicly in the forum, and before the eyes of the consulsthemselves, by an immense crowd which surrounded them; nor could theconsuls appease them now by coercing nor by soothing them. Upon thisthey said that three days should be allowed them to consider of thematter; which interval the consuls employed in examining and planning.The following day they assembled the senate to consider of raising asupply of rowers; and after arguing at great length that the people'srefusal was fair, they brought their discourse to this point, thatwhether it were just or unjust, this burden must be borne by privateindividuals. For from what source could they procure rowers, whenthere was no money in the treasury? and how, without fleets, couldSicily be kept in subjection, or Philip be prevented from enteringItaly, or the shores of Italy be protected?"Book 26,Chapter 36,"In this perplexing state of affairs, when all deliberation was ata stand, and a kind of torpor had seized on men's minds, Laevinus, theconsul, observed, that ""as the magistrates were more honoured than thesenators, and the senators than the people, so also ought they to bethe first in taking upon themselves every thing that was burdensomeand arduous. If you would enjoin any duty on an inferior, and wouldfirst submit yourself and those belonging to you to the obligation,you will find everybody else more ready to obey; nor is an expensethought heavy, when the people see every one of their principal mentaking upon himself more than his proportion of it. Are we thendesirous that the Roman people should have and equip a fleet? thatprivate individuals should without repugnance furnish rowers? Let usfirst execute the command ourselves. Let us, senators, bring into thetreasury to-morrow all our gold, silver, and coined brass, eachreserving rings for himself, his wife, and children, and a bulla forhis son; and he who has a wife or daughters, an ounce weight of goldfor each. Let those who have sat in a curule chair have the ornamentsof a horse, and a pound weight of silver, that they may have asalt-cellar and a dish for the service of the gods. Let the rest ofus, senators, reserve for each father of a family, a pound weight onlyof silver and five thousand coined _asses_. All the rest of ourgold, silver, and coined brass, let us immediately carry to thetriumviri for banking affairs, no decree of the senate having beenpreviously made; that our voluntary contributions, and our emulationin assisting the state, may excite the minds, first, of the equestrianorder to emulate us, and after them of the rest of the community. Thisis the only course which we, your consuls, after much conversation onthe subject, have been able to discover. Adopt it, then, and may thegods prosper the measure. If the state is preserved, she can easilysecure the property of her individual members, but by betraying thepublic interests you would in vain preserve your own."" Thisproposition was received with such entire approbation, that thankswere spontaneously returned to the consuls. The senate was thenadjourned, when every one of the members brought his gold, silver, andbrass into the treasury, with such emulation excited, that they weredesirous that their names should appear among the first on the publictables; so that neither the triumviri were sufficient for receivingnor the notaries for entering them. The unanimity displayed by thesenate was imitated by the equestrian order, and that of theequestrian order by the commons. Thus, without any edict, or coercionof the magistrates, the state neither wanted rowers to make up thenumbers, nor money to pay them; and after every thing had been got inreadiness for the war, the consuls set out for their provinces."Book 26,Chapter 37,"Nor was there ever any period of the war, when both theCarthaginians and the Romans, plunged alike in vicissitudes, were in astate of more anxious suspense between hope and fear. For on the sideof the Romans, with respect to their provinces, their failure in Spainon the one hand, and their successes in Sicily on the other, hadblended joy and sorrow; and in Italy, the loss of Tarentum was aninjury and a source of grief to them, while the unexpectedpreservation of the citadel with the garrison was matter of joy tothem. The sudden terror and panic occasioned by the siege and attackof Rome, was turned into joy by the capture of Capua, a few daysafter. Their affairs beyond sea also were equalized by a kind ofcompensation. Philip had become their enemy at a juncture somewhatunseasonable; but then the Aetolians, and Attalus, king of Asia, wereadded to their allies; fortune now, in a manner, promising to theRomans the empire of the east. The Carthaginians also set the loss ofCapua against the capture of Tarentum; and as they considered it asglorious to them to have reached the walls of Rome without opposition,so they were chagrined at the failure of their attempt, and they feltashamed that they had been held in such contempt, that while they layunder the walls of Rome, a Roman army was marched out for Spain at anopposite gate. With regard also to Spain itself, the greater thereason was to hope that the war there was terminated, and that theRomans were driven from the country, after the destruction of two suchrenowned generals and their armies, so much the greater was theindignation felt, that the victory had been rendered void andfruitless by Lucius Marcius, a general irregularly appointed. Thusfortune balancing events against each other, all was suspense anduncertainty on both sides, their hopes and their fears being as strongas though they were now first commencing the war."Book 26,Chapter 38,"What grieved Hannibal more than any thing was the fact, that Capuahaving been more perseveringly besieged by the Romans than defended byhim, had turned from him the regard of many of the states of Italy,and it was not only impossible for him to retain possession of allthese by means of garrisons, unless he could make up his mind to tearhis army into a number of small portions, which at that time was mostinexpedient, but he could not, by withdrawing the garrisons, leave thefidelity of his allies open to the influence of hope, or subject tothat of fear. His disposition, which was strongly inclined to avariceand cruelty, induced him to plunder the places he could not keeppossession of, that they might be left for the enemy in a state ofdesolation. This resolution was equally horrid in principle and in itsissue, for not only were the affections of those who suffered suchharsh treatment alienated from him, but also of the other states, forthe warning affected a greater number than did the calamity. Nor didthe Roman consul fail to sound the inclinations of the cities,whenever any prospect of success presented itself. Dasius and Blasiuswere the principal men in Salapia, Dasius was the friend of Hannibal,Blasius, as far as he could do it with safety, promoted the Romaninterest, and, by means of secret messengers, had given Marcellushopes of having the place betrayed to him, but the business could notbe accomplished without the assistance of Dasius. After much and longhesitation and even then more for the want of a better plan than fromany hope of success, he addressed himself to Dasius; but he, beingboth adverse to the measure and also hostile to his rival in thegovernment, discovered the affair to Hannibal. Both parties weresummoned, and while Hannibal was transacting some business on histribunal, intending presently to take cognizance of the case ofBlasius, and the accuser and the accused were standing apart from thecrowd, which was put back, Blasius solicited Dasius on the subject ofsurrendering the city; when he exclaimed, as if the case were nowclearly proved, that he was being treated with about the betrayal ofthe city, even before the eyes of Hannibal. The more audacious theproceeding was, the less probable did it appear to Hannibal and thosewho were present. They considered that the charge was undoubtedly amatter of rivalry and animosity, and that it had been brought becauseit was of such a nature that, not admitting of being proved bywitnesses, it could the more easily be fabricated. Accordingly theparties were dismissed. But Blasius, notwithstanding, desisted notfrom his bold undertaking, till by continually harping upon the samesubject, and proving how conducive such a measure would be tothemselves and their country, he carried his point that the Punicgarrison, consisting of five hundred Numidians, and Salapia, should bedelivered up to Marcellus. Nor could it be betrayed without muchbloodshed, consisting of the bravest of the cavalry in the whole Punicarmy. Accordingly, though the event was unexpected, and their horseswere of no use to them in the city, yet hastily taking arms, duringthe confusion, they endeavoured to force their way out; and not beingable to escape, they fell fighting to the last, not more than fifty ofthem falling into the hands of the enemy alive. The loss of this bodyof cavalry was considerably more detrimental to Hannibal than that ofSalapia, for the Carthaginian was never afterwards superior incavalry, in which he had before been most effective."Book 26,Chapter 39,"During this time the scarcity of provisions in the citadel ofTarentum was almost intolerable; the Roman garrison there, and MarcusLivius, the praefect of the garrison and the citadel, placing alltheir dependence in the supplies sent from Sicily; that these mightsafely pass along the coast of Italy, a fleet of about twenty shipswas stationed at Rhegium. Decius Quinctius, a man of obscure birth,but who had acquired great renown as a soldier, on account of manyacts of bravery, had charge of the fleet and the convoys. At first hehad five ships, the largest of which were two triremes, given to himby Marcellus, but afterwards, in consequence of his spirited conducton many occasions, three quinqueremes were added to his number, atlast, by exacting from the allied states of Rhegium, Velia, andPaestum, the ships they were bound to furnish according to treaty, hemade up a fleet of twenty ships, as was before stated. This fleetsetting out from Rhegium, was met at Sacriportus, about fifteen milesfrom the city by Democrates, with an equal number of Tarentine ships.It happened that the Roman was then coming with his sails up, notexpecting an approaching contest, but in the neighbourhood of Crotoand Sybaris, he had supplied his ships with rowers, and had his fleetexcellently equipped and armed for the size of his vessels, and italso happened, that just at the time when the enemy were in sight, thewind completely fell, so that there was sufficient time to furl theirsails, and get their rowers and soldiers in readiness for theapproaching action. Rarely elsewhere have regular fleets engaged withso much spirit, for they fought for what was of greater importancethan the fleets themselves. The Tarentines, in order that, havingrecovered their city from the Romans after the lapse of almost acentury, they might also rescue their citadel, hoping also to cut offthe supplies of their enemy, if by a naval battle they could deprivethem of the dominion of the sea. The Romans, that, by keepingpossession of the citadel, they might prove that Tarentum was lost notby the strength and valour of their enemies, but by treachery andstealth. Accordingly, the signal having been given on both sides, theycharged each other with the beaks of their ships, and neither did theydraw back their own, nor allow the ships of the enemy with which theywere engaged to separate from them, having thrown then grapplingirons, and thus the battle was carried on in such close quarters, thatthey fought not only with missile weapons, but in a manner foot tofoot even with their swords. The prows joined together remainedstationary, while the sterns were moved round by the force of theiradversaries' oars. The ships were crowded together in so small acompass, that scarcely one weapon fell into the sea without takingeffect. They pressed front against front like lines of troops engagingon land, and the combatants could pass from one ship to another. Butthe contest between two ships which had engaged each other in the van,was remarkable above the rest. In the Roman ship was Quinctiushimself, in the Tarentine, Nico, surnamed Perco, who hated, and washated by, the Romans, not only on public grounds, but also personally,for he belonged to that faction which had betrayed Tarentum toHannibal. This man transfixed Quinctius with a spear while off hisguard, and engaged at once in fighting and encouraging his men, and heimmediately fell headlong with his arms over the prow. The victoriousTarentine promptly boarded the ship, which was all in confusion fromthe loss of the commander, and when he had driven the enemy back, andthe Tarentines had got possession of the prow, the Romans, who hadformed themselves into a compact body, with difficulty defending thestern, suddenly another trireme of the enemy appeared at the stern.Thus the Roman ship, enclosed between the two, was captured. Upon thisa panic spread among the rest, seeing the commander's ship captured,and flying in every direction, some were sunk in the deep and somerowed hastily to land, where, shortly after, they became a prey to theThurians and Metapontines. Of the storeships which followed, ladenwith provisions, a very few fell into the hands of the enemy; therest, shifting their sails from one side to another with the changingwinds, escaped into the open sea. An affair took place at Tarentum atthis time, which was attended with widely different success; for aparty of four thousand men had gone out to forage, and while they weredispersed, and roaming through the country, Livius, the commander ofthe citadel and the Roman garrison, who was anxious to seize everyopportunity of striking a blow, sent out of the citadel Caius Persius,an active officer, with two thousand soldiers, who attacked themsuddenly when widely dispersed and straggling about the fields; andafter slaying them for a long time on all hands, drove the few thatremained of so many into the city, to which they fled in alarm andconfusion, and where they rushed in at the doors of the gates, whichwere half-opened that the city might not be taken in the same attack.In this manner affairs were equally balanced at Tarentum, the Romansbeing victorious by land, and the Tarentines by sea. Both parties wereequally disappointed in their hope of receiving provisions after theywere within sight."Book 26,Chapter 40,"While these events were occurring, the consul, Laevinus, after agreat part of the year had elapsed, having arrived in Sicily, where hehad been expected by both the old and new allies, considered it hisfirst and principal duty to adjust the affairs of Syracuse, which werestill in a state of disorder, the peace being but recent. He thenmarched his legions to Agrigentum, the seat of the remaining part ofthe war, which was occupied by a strong garrison of Carthaginians; andhere fortune favoured his attempt. Hanno was commander-in-chief ofthe Carthaginians, but their whole reliance was placed upon Mutinesand the Numidians. Mutines, scouring the whole of Sicily, employedhimself in carrying off spoil from the allies of the Romans; nor couldhe by force or stratagem be cut off from Agrigentum, or prevented fromsallying from it whenever he pleased. The renown which he gained bythis conduct, as it began now to eclipse the fame of thecommander-in-chief, was at last converted into a source of jealousy;so that even now his successes were not as acceptable as they ought tohave been, on account of the person who gained them. For these reasonsHanno at last gave his commission to his own son, concluding that bytaking away his command he should also deprive him of the influence hepossessed with the Numidians. But the result was very different; fortheir former attachment to him was increased by the envy incurred byhim. Nor did he brook the affront put upon him by this injurioustreatment, but immediately sent secret messengers to Laevinus, totreat about delivering up Agrigentum. After an agreement had beenentered into by means of these persons, and the mode of carrying itinto execution concerted, the Numidians seized on a gate which leadstowards the sea, having driven the guards from it, or put them to thesword, and then received into the city a party of Romans sent for thatpurpose; and when these troops were now marching into the heart of thecity and the forum with a great noise, Hanno, concluding that it wasnothing more than a disturbance and secession of the Numidians, suchas had happened before, advanced to quell the mutiny; but observing ata distance that the numbers were greater than those of the Numidians,and hearing the Roman shout, which was far from being new to him, hebetook himself to flight before he came within reach of their weapons.Passing out of the town at a gate in the opposite quarter, and takingEpicydes to accompany him, he reached the sea with a few attendants;and having very seasonably met with a small vessel, they abandoned tothe enemy Sicily, for which they had contended for so many years, andcrossed over into Africa. The remaining multitude of Carthaginians andSicilians fled with headlong haste, but as every passage by which theycould escape was blockaded up, they were cut to pieces near the gates.On gaining possession of the town, Laevinus scourged and beheadedthose who took the lead in the affairs of Agrigentum. The rest,together with the booty, he sold. All the money he sent to Rome.Accounts of the sufferings of the Agrigentines spreading through allSicily, all the states suddenly turned to the Romans. In a short timetwenty towns were betrayed to them, and six taken by storm. As many asforty put themselves under their protection, by voluntary surrender.The consul having rewarded and punished the leading men of thesestates, according to their several deserts, and compelled theSicilians, now that they had at length laid aside arms, to turn theirattention to the cultivation of their lands, in order that the islandmight by its produce not only maintain its inhabitants, but, as it hadfrequently done on many former occasions, add to the supplies of Romeand Italy, he returned into Italy, taking with him a disorderlymultitude from Agathyrna. These were as many as four thousand men,made up of a mixed assemblage of every description of persons, exiles,bankrupts, the greater part of them felons, who had supportedthemselves by rapine and robbery, both when they lived in their nativetowns, under the restraint of the laws, and also after that acoincidence in their fortunes, brought about by causes different ineach case, had congregated them at Agathyrna. These men Laevinusthought it hardly safe to leave in the island, when an unwontedtranquillity was growing up, as the materials of fresh disturbances;and besides, they were likely to be useful to the Rhegians, who werein want of a band of men habituated to robbery, for the purpose ofcommitting depredations upon the Bruttian territory. Thus, so far asrelated to Sicily, the war was this year terminated."Book 26,Chapter 41,"In Spain, in the beginning of spring, Publius Scipio, havinglaunched his ships, and summoned the auxiliary troops of his allies toTarraco by an edict, ordered his fleet and transports to proceedthence to the mouth of the Iberus. He also ordered his legions to quittheir winter quarters, and meet at the same place; and then set outfrom Tarraco, with five thousand of the allies, to join the army. Onhis arrival at the camp he considered it right to harangue hissoldiers, particularly the old ones who had survived such dreadfuldisasters; and therefore, calling an assembly, he thus addressed them:""Never was there a new commander before myself who could, with justiceand good reason, give thanks to his soldiers before he had availedhimself of their services. Fortune laid me under obligations to youbefore I set eyes on my province or your camp; first, on account ofthe respect you have shown to my father and uncle, both in theirlifetime and since their death; and secondly, because by your valouryou have recovered and preserved entire, for the Roman people, and metheir successor, the possession of the province which had been lost inconsequence of so dreadful a calamity. But since, now, by the favourof the gods, our purpose and endeavour is not that we may remain inSpain ourselves, but that the Carthaginians may not; and not to standon the bank of the Iberus, and hinder the enemy from crossing thatriver, but cross it first ourselves, and carry the war to the otherside, I fear lest to some among you the enterprise should appear tooimportant and daring, considering your late misfortunes, which arefresh in your recollection, and my years. There is no person fromwhose mind the memory of the defeats sustained in Spain could beobliterated with more difficulty than from mine; inasmuch as there myfather and uncle were both slain within the space of thirty days, sothat one death after another was accumulated on my family. But as theorphanhood and desolation of my own family depresses my mind, so boththe good fortune and valour of our nation forbid me to despair of thesafety of the state. It has happened to us by a kind of fatality, thatin all important wars we have been victorious, after having beendefeated. I pass over those wars of ancient date with Porsena, theGauls, and Samnites. I will begin with the Punic wars. How manyfleets, generals, and armies were lost in the former war? Why should Imention what has occurred in this present war? I have either beenmyself present at all the defeats sustained, or have felt more thanany other those from which I was absent. What else are the Trebia, theTrasimenus, and Cannae, but monuments of Roman armies and consulsslain? Add to these the defection of Italy, of the greater part ofSicily and Sardinia, and the last terror and panic, the Carthaginiancamp pitched between the Anio and the walls of Rome, and thevictorious Hannibal seen almost in our gates. Amid this general ruin,the courage of the Roman people alone stood unabated and unshaken.When every thing lay prostrate on the ground, it was this that raisedand supported the state. You, first of all, my soldiers, under theconduct and auspices of my father, opposed Hasdrubal on his way to theAlps and Italy, after the defeat of Cannae, who, had he formed ajunction with his brother, the Roman name would now have been extinct.These successes formed a counterpoise to those defeats. Now, by thefavour of the gods, every thing in Italy and Sicily is going onprosperously and successfully, every day affording matter of freshjoy, and presenting things in a better light. In Sicily, Syracuse andAgrigentum have been captured, the enemy entirely expelled the island,and the province placed again under the dominion of the Romans. InItaly, Arpi has been recovered and Capua taken. Hannibal has beendriven into the remotest corner of Bruttium, having fled thither allthe way from Rome, in the utmost confusion; and now he asks the godsno greater boon than that he might be allowed to retire in safety, andquit the territory of his enemy. What then, my soldiers, could be morepreposterous than that you, who here supported the tottering fortuneof the Roman people, together with my parents, (for they may beequally associated in the honour of that epithet,) when calamitiescrowded one upon another in quick succession, and even the godsthemselves, in a manner, took part with Hannibal, should now sink inspirits when every thing is going on happily and prosperously? Evenwith regard to the events which have recently occurred, I could wishthat they had passed with as little grief to me as to you. At thepresent time the immortal gods who preside over the destinies of theRoman empire, who inspired all the centuries to order the command tobe given to me, those same gods, I say, by auguries and auspices, andeven by nightly visions, portend entire success and joy. My own mindalso, which has hitherto been to me the truest prophet, presages thatSpain will be ours; that the whole Carthaginian name will in a shorttime be banished from this land, and will fill both sea and land withignominious flight. What my mind presages spontaneously, is alsosupported by sound reasoning. Their allies, annoyed by them, are byambassadors imploring our protection; their three generals, havingdiffered so far as almost to have abandoned each other, have dividedtheir army into three parts, which they have drawn off into regions asremote as possible from each other. The same fortune now threatensthem which lately afflicted us; for they are both deserted by theirallies, as formerly we were by the Celtiberians, and they have dividedtheir forces, which occasioned the ruin of my father and uncle.Neither will their intestine differences allow them to unite, nor willthey be able to cope with us singly. Only do you, my soldiers, favourthe name of the Scipios, favour the offspring of your generals, ascion springing up from the trunks which have been cut down. Comethen, veterans, lead your new commander and your new army across theIberus, lead us across into a country which you have often traversed,with many a deed of valour. I will soon bring it to pass that, as younow trace in me a likeness to my father and uncle in my features,countenance, and figure, I will so restore a copy of their genius,honour, and courage, to you, that every man of you shall say that hiscommander, Scipio, has either returned to life, or has been bornagain."""Book 26,Chapter 42,"Having animated his troops with this harangue, and leaving MarcusSilanus with three thousand infantry and three hundred horse, for theprotection of that district, he crossed the Iberus with all the restof his troops, consisting of twenty-five thousand infantry and twothousand five hundred horse. Though certain persons there endeavouredto persuade him that, as the Carthaginian armies had retired from eachother into three such distant quarters, he should attack the nearestof them; yet concluding that if he did so there was danger lest heshould cause them to concentrate all their forces, and he alone shouldnot be a match for so many, he determined for the present to make anattack upon New Carthage, a city not only possessing great wealth ofits own, but also full of every kind of military store belonging tothe enemy; there were their arms, their money, and the hostages fromevery part of Spain. It was, besides, conveniently situated, not onlyfor a passage into Africa, but also near a port sufficiently capaciousfor a fleet of any magnitude, and, for aught I know, the only one onthe coast of Spain which is washed by our sea. No one but CaiusLaelius knew whither he was going. He was sent round with the fleet,and ordered so to regulate the sailing of his ships, that the armymight come in view and the fleet enter the harbour at the same time.Both the fleet and army arrived at the same time at New Carthage, onthe seventh day after leaving the Iberus. The camp was pitched overagainst that part of the city which looks to the north. A rampart wasthrown up as a defence on the rear of it, for the front was secured bythe nature of the ground. Now the situation of New Carthage is asfollows: at about the middle of the coast of Spain is a bay facing forthe most part the south-west, about two thousand five hundred paces indepth, and a little more in breadth. In the mouth of this bay is asmall island forming a barrier towards the sea, and protecting theharbour from every wind except the south-west. From the bottom of thebay there runs out a peninsula, which forms the eminence on which thecity is built; which is washed in the east and south by the sea, andon the west is enclosed by a lake which extends a little way alsotowards the north, of variable depth according as the sea overflows orebbs. An isthmus of about two hundred paces broad connects the citywith the continent, on which, though it would have been a work of solittle labour, the Roman general did not raise a rampart; whether hisobject was to make a display of his confidence to the enemy frommotives of pride, or that he might have free regress when frequentlyadvancing to the walls of the city."Book 26,Chapter 43,"Having completed the other requisite works, he drew up his shipsin the harbour, that he might exhibit to the enemy the appearance of ablockade by sea also; he then went round the fleet, and having warnedthe commanders of the ships to be particularly careful in keeping thenight-watches, because an enemy, when besieged, usually tried everyeffort and in every quarter at first, he returned into his camp; andin order to explain to his soldiers the reason why he had adopted theplan of commencing the war with the siege of a city, in preference toany other, and also by exhortations to inspire them with hopes ofmaking themselves masters of it, he summoned them to an assembly, andthus addressed them: ""Soldiers, if any one among you suppose that youhave been brought here to attack a single city, that man takes a moreexact account of your present labour than of its profitable resultfrom it. For you will in truth attack the walls of a single city, butin that single city you will have made yourselves masters of allSpain. Here are the hostages of all her most distinguished kings andstates; and as soon as you shall have gained possession of these, theywill immediately deliver into your hands every thing which is nowsubject to the Carthaginians. Here is the whole of the enemy'streasure, without which they cannot carry on the war, as they arekeeping mercenary troops, and which will be most serviceable to us inconciliating the affections of the barbarians. Here are their engines,their arms, their tackle, and every requisite in war; which will atonce supply you, and leave the enemy destitute. Besides, we shall gainpossession of a city, not only of the greatest beauty and wealth, butalso most convenient as having an excellent harbour, by means of whichwe may be supplied with every requisite for carrying on the war bothby sea and land. Great as are the advantages we shall thus gain, weshall deprive our enemies of much greater. This is their citadel,their granary, their treasury, their magazine, their receptacle forevery thing. Hence there is a direct passage into Africa; this is theonly station for a fleet between the Pyrenees and Gades; this gives toAfrica the command of all Spain. But as I perceive you are arrayed andmarshalled, let us pass on to the assault of New Carthage, with ourwhole strength, and with undaunted courage."" Upon this, they all with,one accord cried out that it should be done; and he led them toCarthage, and ordered that the assault should be made both by sea andland."Book 26,Chapter 44,"On the other side, Mago, the Carthaginian general, perceiving thata siege was being prepared for both by sea and land, himself alsodisposed his forces thus: he placed two thousand of the townsmen tooppose the enemy, on the side facing the Roman camp; he occupied thecitadel with five hundred soldiers, and stationed five hundred on arising ground, facing the east; the rest of his troops he ordered,intent on every thing that occurred, to hasten with assistancewherever the shout, or any sudden emergency, might call them. Then,throwing open the gate, he sent out those he had drawn up in thestreet leading to the camp of the enemy. The Romans, according to thedirection of their general, retired a little, in order that they mightbe nearer to the reserved troops which were to be sent to theirassistance during the engagement. At first they stood with prettyequal force, but afterwards the reserved troops, sent from time totime from the camp, not only obliged the enemy to turn their backs,but followed them up so close when flying in disorder, that had not aretreat been sounded, they seemed as though they would have rushedinto the city together with the fugitives. The consternation in thefield was not greater than in every part of the city; many of theoutposts were abandoned in panic and flight; and the walls weredeserted, as they leaped down each in the part nearest him. Scipio,who had gone out to an eminence called Mercury's hill, perceiving thatthe walls were abandoned by their defenders in many parts, ordered allhis men to be called out of his camp and advance to take the city, andorders them to bring the scaling-ladders. The general himself, coveredby the shields of three stout young men, (for now an immense number ofmissiles of every description were let fly from the walls,) came up tothe city, cheered them on, and gave the requisite orders; and, whatwas of the utmost importance in exciting the courage of his men, heappeared among them a witness and spectator of the valour or cowardiceof each. Accordingly, they rushed forward, amidst wounds and weapons;nor could the walls, or the armed troops which stood upon them, repelthem from eagerly mounting them. At the same time an attack wascommenced by the fleet upon that part of the city which was washed bythe sea. But here the alarm occasioned was greater than the forcewhich could be employed; for while they were bringing the boats toshore, and hastily landing the ladders and the men, each man pressingforward to gain the land the shortest way, they hindered one anotherby their very haste and eagerness."Book 26,Chapter 45,"In the mean time, the Carthaginians had now filled the walls againwith armed men, who were supplied with a great quantity of missilesfrom the immense stores which they had laid up. But neither men normissiles, nor any thing else, so effectually defended them as thewalls themselves, for very few of the ladders were equal to the heightof them, and all those which were longer than the rest wereproportionably weaker. Accordingly, those who were highest beingunable to mount from them, and being followed, nevertheless, byothers, they broke from the mere weight upon them. Some, though theladders stood, a dizziness having come over their eyes in consequenceof the height, fell to the ground. And as men and ladders were everywhere tumbling down, while the boldness and alacrity of the enemy wereincreased by the mere success, the signal for retreat was sounded,which afforded hopes to the besieged, not only of present rest aftersuch a laborious contest, but also for the future, as it appearedtheir city could not be taken by scalade and siege. To raise worksthey considered would be attended with difficulty, and would give timeto their generals to bring them assistance. Scarcely had the firsttumult subsided, when Scipio ordered other fresh and unfatigued troopsto take the ladders from those who were tired and wounded and assaultthe city with increased vigour. Having received intelligence that thetide was ebbing, and having before been informed by some fishermen ofTarraco who used to pass through the lake, sometimes in light boats,and, when these ran aground, by wading, that it afforded an easypassage to the wall for footmen, he led some armed men thither inperson. It was about mid-day, and besides that the water was beingdrawn off naturally, in consequence of the tide receding, a brisknorth wind rising impelled the water in the lake, which was already inmotion, in the same direction as the tide, and rendered it so shallow,that in some parts the water reached only to the navel, while inothers it scarcely rose above the knees. Scipio, referring thisdiscovery, which he had made by his own diligence and penetration, tothe gods and to miracle, which had turned the course of the sea,withdrawn it from the lake, and opened ways never before trodden byhuman feet to afford a passage to the Romans, ordered them to followNeptune as their guide, and passing through the middle of the lake,make good their way to the walls."Book 26,Chapter 46,"Those who renewed the assault by land experienced greatdifficulty; for they were baffled not only by the height of the walls,but also because they exposed the Romans, as they approached them, tothe missiles of the enemy from different quarters, so that their sideswere endangered more than the fronts of their bodies. But in the otherquarter five hundred passed without difficulty through the lake, andthen mounted the wall, for neither was it defended by anyfortifications, because there they thought the city was sufficientlyprotected by the nature of the place and the lake, nor were there anyoutposts or guards stationed there, because all were engaged inbringing succour to that quarter in which the danger appeared. Havingentered the city without opposition, they proceeded direct, with allpossible speed, to that gate near which the contest was concentrated;and so intently occupied with this were not only the minds, but theeyes and ears of all, both of those who were engaged in fighting, andof those who were looking on and encouraging the combatants, that noone perceived that the city had been captured in their rear till theweapons fell upon their backs, and they had an enemy on both sides ofthem. Then, the defenders having been thrown into confusion throughfear, both the walls were captured, and the gate began to be brokenopen both from within and from without; and presently, the doorshaving been broken to pieces by blows, in order that the way might notbe obstructed, the troops rushed in. A great number had also got overthe walls, but these employed themselves in putting the townsmen tothe sword; those which entered by the gate, forming a regular body,with officers and in ranks, advanced through the midst of the cityinto the forum. Scipio then perceiving that the enemy fled in twodifferent directions, some to the eminence which lay eastward, whichwas occupied by a garrison of five hundred men, others to the citadel,into which Mago himself also had fled for refuge, together with almostall the troops which had been driven from the walls, sent part of hisforces to storm the hill, and part he led in person against thecitadel. Not only was the hill captured at the first assault, but Magoalso, after making an effort to defend it, when he saw every placefilled with the enemy, and that there was no hope, surrendered himselfand the citadel, with the garrison. Until the citadel was surrendered,the massacre was continued in every quarter throughout the city; nordid they spare any one they met who had arrived at puberty: but afterthat, on a signal given, a stop was put to the carnage, and thevictors turned their attention to the plunder, of which there was animmense quantity of every description."Book 26,Chapter 47,"Of males of free condition, as many as ten thousand were captured.Of these he allowed to depart such as were citizens of New Carthage;and restored to them their city, and all their property which the warhad left them. The artisans amounted to two thousand, whom he assignedto the Roman people as their property; holding out to them a hope ofspeedy emancipation, provided they should address themselvesstrenuously to the service of the war. Of the rest of the mass ofinhabitants, the young men and able-bodied slaves he assigned for theservice of the fleet, to fill up the numbers of the rowers. He hadalso augmented his fleet with five ships which he had captured.Besides this multitude, there remained the Spanish hostages, to whomas much attention was paid as if they had been children of allies. Animmense quantity of military stores was also taken; one hundred andtwenty catapultae of the larger size, two hundred and eighty-one ofthe smaller; twenty-three ballistae of the larger size, fifty-two ofthe smaller; an immense number of scorpions of the larger and smallersize, and also of arms and missile weapons; and seventy-four militarystandards. Of gold and silver, an immense quantity was brought to thegeneral; there were two hundred and seventy-six golden bowls, almostall of them weighing a pound; of silver, wrought and coined, eighteenthousand three hundred pounds' weight; and of silver vessels animmense number. All these were weighed and reckoned to the quaestor,Caius Flaminius. There were twenty thousand pecks of wheat, and twohundred and seventy of barley. One hundred and thirteen ships ofburden were boarded and captured in the harbour, some of them withtheir cargoes, consisting of corn and arms, besides brass, iron,sails, spartum, and other naval materials, of use in equipping afleet; so that amid such large military stores which were captured,Carthage itself was of the least consideration."Book 26,Chapter 48,"Having ordered Caius Laelius with the marines to guard the city,Scipio led back his legions to the camp the same day in person; and ashis soldiers were tired, as they had in one day gone through everykind of military labour; for they had engaged the enemy in the field,and had undergone very great fatigue and danger in taking the city;and after they had taken it had fought, and that on disadvantageousground, with those who had fled to the citadel, he ordered them toattend to themselves. The next day, having assembled the land andnaval forces, he, in the first place, ascribed praise and thanks tothe immortal gods, who had not only in one day made him master of thewealthiest city in Spain, but had previously collected in it theriches of almost all Africa and Spain; so that while his enemy hadnothing left, he and his army had a superabundance of every thing. Hethen commended in the highest terms the valour of his soldiers,because that neither the sally of the enemy, nor the height of thewalls, nor the unexplored fords of the lake, nor the fort standingupon a high hill, nor the citadel, though most strongly fortified, haddeterred them from surmounting and breaking through every thing.Therefore, though all credit was due to them all, he said that the manwho first mounted the wall ought to be distinguished above the rest,by being honoured with a mural crown; and he desired that he whothought himself worthy of that reward would claim it. Two persons laidclaim to it, Quintus Trebellius, a centurion of the fourth legion, andSextus Digitius, a marine. Nor did these contest so fiercely as eachexcited the zeal of his own body of men. Caius Laelius, admiral of thefleet, patronized the marines, and Marcus Sempronius Tuditanus, thelegionary troops. As this contest began almost to assume the characterof a mutiny, Scipio having notified that he should appoint threedelegates, who, after making themselves acquainted with the case, andexamining the witnesses, might decide which had been the first toscale the wall and enter the town, added Publius Cornelius Caudinus, amiddle party, to Laelius and Sempronius, the advocates of the twoparties, and ordered these three delegates to sit and determine thecause. But as the contest was now carried on with increased warmth,because those high characters, who had acted more as moderators of thezeal of both than as advocates of any particular party, werewithdrawn, Caius Laelius, leaving the council, went up to the tribunalof Scipio and informed him, ""that the contest was proceeding withoutbounds or moderation, and that they had almost come to blows. Butstill, though no violence should take place, that the proceedingsformed a most hateful precedent, for that the honours due to valourwere being sought by fraud and perjury. That on one side stood thelegionary troops, on the other the marines, ready to swear by all thegods what they wished, rather than what they knew, to be true, and toinvolve in the guilt of perjury not only themselves and their ownpersons, but the military standards, the eagles, and their solemn oathof allegiance. That he laid these matters before him, in accordancewith the opinion of Publius Cornelius and Marcus Sempronius."" Scipio,after highly praising Laelius, summoned an assembly, and thendeclared, ""that he had ascertained satisfactorily that QuintusTrebellius and Sextus Digitius had mounted the wall at the same time,and that he presented them both with mural crowns in consideration oftheir valour."" He then gave presents to the rest, according to themerit and valour of each. Above all he honoured Caius Laelius, theadmiral of the fleet, by the placing him upon an equality withhimself, and bestowing upon him every kind of commendation, and alsoby presenting him with a golden crown and thirty oxen."Book 26,Chapter 49,"He then ordered the Spanish hostages to be summoned. What thenumber of these was I feel reluctant to state, because in some authorsI find that it was about three hundred, in others seven hundred andtwenty-five. There is the same difference between authors with regardto the other particulars. One writes that the Punic garrison consistedof ten thousand, another of seven, a third of not more than twothousand. In some you may find that ten thousand persons werecaptured, in others above twenty-five thousand. I should have statedthe number of scorpions captured, both of the greater and smallersize, at sixty, if I had followed the Greek author, Silenus, ifValerius Antius, of the larger at six thousand, of the smaller atthirteen, so great is the extent of falsehood. Nor are they agreedeven respecting the commanders, most say that Laelius commanded thefleet, but some say Marcus Junius Silanus. Valerius Antius says, thatArines commanded the Punic garrison, and was given up to the Romans;other writers say it was Mago. They are not agreed respecting thenumber of the ships taken, respecting the weight of gold and silver,and of the money brought into the public treasury. If we must assentto some of their statements, the medium is nearest to the truth.However, Scipio having summoned the hostages, first bid them all keepup their spirits observing, ""that they had fallen into the hands ofthe Roman people, who chose to bind men to them by benefits ratherthan by fear, and keep foreign nations attached to them by honour andfriendship, rather than subject them to a gloomy servitude."" Thenreceiving the names of the states to which they belonged, he took anaccount of the captives, distinguishing the number belonging to eachpeople, and sent messengers to their homes, to desire that they wouldcome and take back their respective friends. If ambassadors from anyof the states happened to be present, he delivered their countrymen tothem in person, and assigned to them the quaestor, Caius Flaminius,the charge of kindly taking care of the rest. Meanwhile, thereadvanced from the midst of the crowd of hostages a woman in years, thewife of Mandonius, who was the brother of Indibilis, the chieftain ofthe Illergetians; she threw herself weeping at the general's feet, andbegan to implore him to give particularly strict injunctions to theirguardians with respect to the care and treatment of females. Scipioreplied, that nothing certainly should be wanting; when the womanrejoined: ""We do not much value such things, for what is not goodenough for such a condition? A care of a different kind disquiets me,when beholding the age of these females; for I am myself no longerexposed to the danger peculiar to females."" Around her stood thedaughters of Indibilis, in the bloom of youth and beauty, with othersof equal rank, all of whom looked up to her as a parent. Scipio thensaid: ""Out of regard for that discipline which I myself and the Romannation maintain, I should take care that nothing, which is any whereheld sacred, should be violated among us. In the present case, yourvirtue and your rank cause me to observe it more strictly; for noteven in the midst of misfortunes have you forgotten the delicacybecoming matrons."" He then delivered them over to a man of triedvirtue, ordering him to treat them with no less respect and modestythan the wives and mothers of guests."Book 26,Chapter 50,"The soldiers then brought to him a female captive, a grown-upvirgin, of such exquisite beauty, that whichever way she walked sheattracted the eyes of every body. Scipio, on making inquiries as toher country and parentage, heard, among other particulars, that shewas betrothed to a young prince of the Celtiberians, named Allucius.He immediately, therefore, summoned from their abode her parents andlover, and having heard in the mean time that the latter wasdesperately enamoured of her, as soon as he arrived he addressed himin a more studied manner than her parents. ""A young man myself,"" saidhe, ""I address myself to a young man, and therefore there need be theless reserve in this conversation. As soon as your intended bride,having been captured by my soldiers, was brought into my presence, andI was informed that she was endeared to you, which her beauty renderedprobable, considering that I should myself wish that my affection formy intended bride, though excessive, should meet with indulgence,could I enjoy the pleasures suited to my age, (particularly in anhonourable and lawful love,) and were not my mind engrossed by publicaffairs, I indulge as far as I can your passion. Your mistress, whileunder my protection, has received as much respect as under the roof ofher own parents, your father-in-law and mother-in-law. She has beenkept in perfect safety for you, that she might be presented to youpure, a gift worthy of me and of you. This only reward I bargain forin return for the service I have rendered you, that you would be afriend to the Roman people, and if you believe that I am a true man,as these nations knew my father and uncle to have been heretofore,that you would feel assured that in the Roman state there are manylike us, and that no nation in the world at the present time can bementioned, with which you ought to be less disposed that you, or thosebelonging to you, should be at enmity, or with which you would ratherbe in friendship."" The young man, overcome at once with joy andmodesty, clung to Scipio's right hand, and invoked all the gods torecompense him in his behalf, since he himself was far from possessingmeans proportioned either to his own wishes or Scipio's deserts. Hethen addressed himself to the parents and relatives of the damsel,who, on receiving her back without any reward, whom they had brought avery large weight of gold to redeem, entreated Scipio to accept itfrom them as a present to himself; affirming, that if he would do so,they should feel as grateful for it as they did for the restoration oftheir daughter inviolate. As they were so earnest in their entreaties,Scipio promised to accept it, and ordered it to be laid at his feet.Then calling Allucius to him, he said: ""To the dowry which you areabout to receive from your father-in-law, let these marriage presentsalso from me be added;"" bidding him take away the gold and keep it forhimself. Delighted with these presents and honours, he was dismissedto his home, where he inspired his countrymen with the deservedpraises of Scipio, observing, ""that a most godlike youth had comeamong them, who conquered every thing, not only by arms, but bykindness and generosity."" Accordingly, making a levy among hisdependants, he returned to Scipio after a few days, with fourteenhundred chosen horsemen."Book 27,Chapter 51,"Scipio kept Laelius with him until he had disposed of thecaptives, hostages, and booty, in accordance with his advice; but whenall these matters were satisfactorily arranged, he gave him aquinquereme; and selecting from the captives Mago, and about fifteensenators who had been made prisoners at the same time with him, putthem on board, and sent him to Rome with the news of his victory. Hehimself employed the few days he had resolved to stay at Carthage, inexercising his naval and land forces. On the first day the legionsunder arms performed evolutions through a space of four miles; on thesecond day he ordered them to repair and clean their arms before theirtents; on the third day they engaged in imitation of a regular battlewith wooden swords, throwing javelins with the points covered withballs; on the fourth day they rested; on the fifth they againperformed evolutions under arms. This succession of exercise and restthey kept up as long as they staid at Carthage. The rowers andmariners, pushing out to sea when the weather was calm, made trial ofthe manageableness of their ships by mock sea-fights. Such exercises,both by sea and land, without the city prepared their minds and bodiesfor war. The city itself was all bustle with warlike preparations,artificers of every description being collected together in a publicworkshop. The general went round to all the works with equalattention. At one time he was employed in the dock-yard with hisfleet, at another he exercised with the legions; sometimes he woulddevote his time to the inspection of the works, which were every daycarried on with the greatest eagerness by a multitude of artificersboth in the workshops, and in the armoury and docks. Having put thesepreparations in a train, repaired the walls in a part where they hadbeen shattered, and placed bodies of troops to guard the city, he setout for Tarraco; and on his way thither was visited by a number ofembassies, some of which he dismissed, having given them answers onhis journey, others he postponed till his arrival at Tarraco; at whichplace he had appointed a meeting of all his new and old allies. Hereambassadors from almost all the people dwelling on this side theIberus, and from many dwelling in the further Spain, met. TheCarthaginian generals at first industriously suppressed the rumour ofthe capture of Carthage; but afterwards, when it became too notoriousto be concealed or dissembled, they disparaged its importance by theirlanguage. They said, that ""by an unexpected attack, and in a manner bystealth, in one day, one city of Spain had been snatched out of theirhands; that a presumptuous youth, elated with the acquisition of this,so inconsiderable an advantage, had, by the extravagance of his joy,given it the air of an important victory; but that as soon as heshould hear that three generals and three victorious armies of hisenemies were approaching, the deaths which had taken place in hisfamily would occur to his recollection."" Such was the tone in whichthey spoke of this affair to the people, though they were, at the sametime, far from ignorant how much their strength had been diminished,in every respect, by the loss of Carthage."Book 27,Chapter 1,"Such was the state of affairs in Spain. In Italy, the consulMarcellus, after regaining Salapia, which was betrayed into his hands,took Maronea and Meles from the Samnites by force. As many as threethousand of the soldiers of Hannibal, which were left as a garrison,were here surprised and overpowered. The booty, and there was aconsiderable quantity of it, was given up to the troops. Also, twohundred and forty thousand pecks of wheat, with a hundred and tenthousand pecks of barley, were found here. The joy, however, thusoccasioned, was by no means so great as a disaster sustained a fewdays afterwards, not far from the town Herdonea. Cneius Fulvius, theconsul, was lying encamped there, in the hope of regaining Herdonea,which had revolted from the Romans after the defeat at Cannae, hisposition being neither sufficiently secure from the nature of theplace, nor strengthened by guards. The natural negligence of thegeneral was now increased by the hope that their attachment to theCarthaginians was shaken when they had heard that Hannibal, after theloss of Salapia, had retired from that neighbourhood into Bruttium.Intelligence of all these circumstances being conveyed to Hannibal bysecret messengers from Herdonea, at once excited an anxious desire toretain possession of a city in alliance with him, and inspired a hopeof attacking the enemy when unprepared. With a lightly equipped forcehe hastened to Herdonea by forced marches, so as almost to anticipatethe report of his approach and in order to strike greater terror intothe enemy, came up with his troops in battle-array. The Roman, equalto him in courage, but inferior in strength, hastily drawing out histroops, engaged him. The fifth legion and the left wing of the alliedinfantry commenced the battle with spirit. But Hannibal ordered hiscavalry, on a signal given, to ride round as soon as the foot forceshad their eyes and thoughts occupied with the contest before them, andone half of them to attack the camp of the enemy, the other half tofall upon their rear, while busily engaged in fighting. He himself,sarcastically alluding to the similarity of the name Fulvius, as hehad defeated Cneius Fulvius, the praetor, two years ago, in the samecountry, expressed his confidence that the issue of the battle wouldbe similar. Nor was this expectation vain; for after many of theRomans had fallen in the close contest, and in the engagement with theinfantry, notwithstanding which they still preserved their ranks andstood their ground; the alarm occasioned by the cavalry on their rear,and the enemy shout, which was heard at the same time from their camp,first put to flight the sixth legion, which being posted in the secondline, was first thrown into confusion by the Numidians; and thenthe fifth legion, and those who were posted in the van. Some fledprecipitately, others were slain in the middle space, where alsoCneius Fulvius himself, with eleven military tribunes, fell. Who canstate with certainty how many thousands of the Romans and their allieswere slain in this battle, when I find in some accounts thatthirteen, in others that not more than seven, thousand were slain?The conquerors got possession of the camp and the spoil. Finding thatHerdonea would have revolted to the Romans, and was not likely tocontinue faithful to him if he departed thence, he removed all itsinhabitants to Metapontum and Thurium, and burnt it. He put to deaththe chief men who were found to have held secret conferences withFulvius. Such of the Romans as escaped this dreadful carnage, fledhalf-armed, by different roads, into Samnium, to the consul Marcellus."Book 27,Chapter 2,"Marcellus, who was not much discouraged at this so great adisaster, sent a letter to the senate at Rome, with an account of theloss of the general and army at Herdonea; observing, however, ""that hewho, after the battle of Cannae, had humbled Hannibal when elated withvictory, was now marching against him, and that he would cause thathis present joy and exultation should not continue long."" At Rome,indeed, the grief occasioned by what had occurred, and the fearsentertained for the future, were excessive. The consul passing out ofSamnium into Lucania, pitched his camp at Numistro, on a plainwithin view of Hannibal, who occupied a hill. He added also anotherdemonstration of his confidence; for he was the first to lead out histroops to battle, nor did Hannibal decline fighting when he saw thestandards carried out from the gates. However, they drew up theirforces so that the right wing of the Carthaginians was extended up thehill, while the left wing of the Romans was contiguous to the town.For a long time neither side had any advantage; but the battle havingcontinued from the third hour till night, and the first lines, whichconsisted, on the part of the Romans, of the first legion and theright wing of the allied infantry, on the part of Hannibal, of theSpanish soldiers, the Balearic slingers, and the elephants, whichwere driven into the field after the commencement of the battle, beingfatigued with fighting, the first legion was relieved by the third,and the right wing of allied infantry by the left; while on the partof the enemy fresh troops took up the battle in place of those whowere tired. A new and desperate conflict suddenly arose, instead ofthat which was so feebly maintained, their minds and bodies beingunimpaired by fatigue; but night separated the combatants while thevictory was undecided. The following day the Romans stood drawn upfor battle from sun-rise till late in the day; but none of the enemycoming out against them, they gathered the spoils at their leisure,and collecting the bodies of their own troops into a heap, burnt them.The following night Hannibal decamped in silence, and moved on intoApulia. As soon as daylight discovered the flight of the enemy,Marcellus, leaving his wounded under the protection of a smallgarrison at Numistro, in command of which he placed Lucius FuriusPurpureo, a military tribune, commenced a close pursuit of Hannibal,and overtook him at Venusia. Here, during several days, parties oftroops sallying from the outposts, battles took place between foot andhorses promiscuously, rather irregular than important, but which forthe most part were favourable to the Romans. The armies were marchedthence through Apulia without any engagement worth recording; forHannibal marched by night, seeking an opportunity for ambuscade,but Marcellus never followed him except in broad daylight, and afterhaving explored the country."Book 27,Chapter 3,"In the mean time, while Flaccus was detained at Capua in sellingthe property of the nobles, and letting out the land which had beenforfeited, all of which he let for a rent to be paid in corn, lestoccasions for exercising severity toward the Campanians should bewanting, a new piece of inquiry which had been ripening in secret, wasbrought out in evidence. He had compelled his soldiers, withdrawn fromthe houses, to build for themselves huts after the military manner,near the gates and walls; at once, that the houses of the city mightbe let and occupied together with the land, also through fear, lestthe excessive luxury of the city should enervate his troops as it hadthose of Hannibal. Now many of these were formed of hurdles or boards,others of reeds interwoven, all being covered with straw, as ifcombustable materials had been employed on purpose. A hundred andseventy Campanians, headed by the Blosii who were fathers, had formeda conspiracy to set fire to all these at a late hour of the night; butinformation of the conspiracy having been given by one of the slavesof the Blosii, the gates were suddenly closed by the command of theproconsul, and all the soldiers had been assembled under arms, on asignal given all who were implicated in the guilt were seized, and,after rigorous examination, were condemned and executed, informerswere rewarded with liberty and ten thousand _asses_ each. The peopleof Nuceria and Acerra, who complained that they had no where to dwell,Acerra being partly burnt, and Nuceria demolished, Fulvius sent toRome to the senate. Permission was given to the people of Acerra torebuild what had been destroyed by fire. The people of Nuceria wereremoved to Atella, as they preferred; the people of Atella beingordered to migrate to Calatia. Among the many and important events,sometimes prosperous, sometimes adverse, which occupied men'sthoughts, not even the citadel of Tarentum was forgotten. MarcusOgulnius and Publius Aquillius went into Etruria as commissioners tobuy up corn to be conveyed to Tarentum; and one thousand men out ofthe city troops, an equal number of Romans and allies, were sent tothe same place, together with the corn, for its protection."Book 27,Chapter 4,"The summer was now on the close, and the time for the election ofconsuls drew nigh; but a letter from Marcellus, in which he stated,that it would not be for the interest of the state that he shoulddepart a single step from Hannibal, whom he was severely pressingwhile retreating before him and evading an engagement, had excitedanxiety, lest they must either recall the consul from the war at thattime when he was most actively employed, or consuls should not beappointed for the year. The best course appeared to be to recall inpreference the consul Valerius from Sicily, although he was out ofItaly. A letter was sent to him by Lucius Manlius, the city praetor,by order of the senate, together with the letter of Marcus Marcellus,the consul, that he might learn from it what reason the senate had forrecalling him from his province rather than his colleague. Much aboutthis time ambassadors came to Rome from king Syphax with accounts ofthe successful battles which he had fought with the Carthaginians.They assured the senate that there was no people to whom the kingwas more hostile than the Carthaginians, and none to whom he wasmore friendly than the Romans. They said, that ""he had before sentambassadors into Spain, to Cneius and Publius Cornelius, the Romangenerals, but that he was now desirous to solicit the friendship ofthe Romans, as it were, from the fountain-head itself."" The senate notonly returned a gracious answer to the ambassadors, but also sentas ambassadors to the king, with presents, Lucius Genucius, PubliusPaetelius, and Publius Popillius. The presents they carried were apurple gown and vest, an ivory chair, and a bowl formed out of fivepounds of gold. They received orders to proceed forthwith to otherpetty princes of Africa carrying with them as presents for them gownsbordered with purple, and golden bowls weighing three pounds each.Marcus Atilius and Manius Acilius were also sent as ambassadors toAlexandria, to king Ptolemy and queen Cleopatra, to revive and renewthe treaty of friendship with them, carrying with them as presentsa gown and purple tunic, with an ivory chair for the king, and anembroidered gown and a purple vest for the queen. During the summer inwhich these transactions took place, many prodigies were reported fromthe country and cities in the neighbourhood; at Tusculum it was saidthat a lamb was yeaned with its dug full of milk; that the roof of thetemple of Jupiter was struck with lightning and almost stripped ofits entire covering. Much about the same time it was reported thatthe ground in front of the gate at Anagnia was struck, and that itcontinued burning for a day and a night without any thing to feedthe fire; that at Compitum in the territory of Anagnia, the birds haddeserted the nests in the trees in the grove of Diana; that snakesof amazing size had leaped up, like fishes sporting, in the sea atTaracina not far from the port; at Tarquinii, that a pig was producedwith a human face; that in the territory of Capena at the grove ofFeronia, four statues had sweated blood profusely for a day and anight. These prodigies were expiated with victims of the greater kind,according to a decree of the pontiffs, and a supplication was fixedto be performed for one day at Rome at all the shrines, and another inthe territory of Capena at the grove of Feronia."Book 27,Chapter 5,"Marcus Valerius, the consul, having been summoned by letter, gavethe command of the province and his army to Cincius the praetor, sentMarcus Valerius Messala, commander of the fleet, with half of theships to Africa, at the same time to plunder the country and observewhat the Carthaginians were doing, and what preparations they weremaking, and then set out himself with ten ships for Rome; where,having arrived in safety, he immediately convened the senate. Herehe made a recital of his services. That ""after hostilities had beencarried on, and severe losses often sustained, both by sea and land,through a period of almost sixty years, he had completely terminatedthe business of the province. That there was not one Carthaginian inSicily, nor one Sicilian absent of those who through fear had beencompelled to go into exile and live abroad; that all of them werebrought back to their cities and fields, and were employed inploughing and sowing; that the land which was deserted was now againinhabited, not only yielding its fruits to its cultivators, butforming a most certain resource for the supply of provisions to theRoman people in peace and war."" After this, Mutines and such others ashad rendered any services to the Roman people were introduced intothe senate, and all received honorary rewards in fulfilment ofthe consul's engagement. Mutines was also made a Roman citizen,a proposition to that effect having been made to the commons by aplebeian tribune, on the authority of the senate. While these thingswere going on at Rome, Marcus Valerius Messala, arriving on the coastof Africa before daylight, made a sudden descent on the territoryof Utica; and after ravaging it to a great extent, and taking manyprisoners, together with booty of every kind, he returned to his shipsand sailed over to Sicily. He returned to Lilybaeum on the thirteenthday from the time he left it. From the prisoners, on examination, thefollowing facts were discovered, and all communicated in writing tothe consul Laevinus in order, so that he might know in what state theaffairs of Africa were. That ""five thousand Numidians, with Masinissa,the son of Gala, a youth of extraordinary spirit, were at Carthage,and that other troops were hiring throughout all Africa, to be passedover into Spain to Hasdrubal; in order that he might, as soon aspossible, pass over into Italy, with as large a force as could becollected, and form a junction with Hannibal."" That the Carthaginiansconsidered their success dependent on this measure. That a very largefleet was also in preparation for the recovery of Sicily, which theybelieved would sail thither in a short time. The recital of thesefacts had such an effect upon the senate, that they resolved that theconsul ought not to wait for the election, but that a dictator shouldbe appointed to hold it, and that the consul should immediately returnto his province. A difference of opinion delayed this, for the consuldeclared that he should nominate as dictator Marcus Valerius Messala,who then commanded the fleet in Sicily; but the fathers denied that aperson could be appointed dictator who was not in the Roman territory,and this was limited by Italy. Marcus Lucretius, a plebeian tribune,having taken the sense of the senate upon the question, it wasdecreed, ""that the consul before he quitted the city, should putthe question to the people, as to whom they wished to be appointeddictator, and that he should nominate whomsoever they directed. If theconsul were unwilling that the praetor should put the question, andif even he were unwilling to do it, that then the tribunes should makethe proposition to the commons."" The consul refusing to submit to thepeople what lay in his own power, and forbidding the praetor to do so,the plebeian tribunes put the question, and the commons ordered thatQuintus Fulvius, who was then at Capua, should be nominated dictator.But on the night preceding the day on which the assembly of the peoplewas to be held for that purpose, the consul went off privately intoSicily; and the fathers, thus deserted, decreed that a letter shouldbe sent to Marcus Claudius, in order that he might come to the supportof the state, which had been abandoned by his colleague, and appointhim dictator whom the commons had ordered. Thus Quintus Fulvius wasappointed dictator by Marcus Claudius, the consul, and in conformitywith the same order of the people, Publius Licinius Crassus, chiefpontiff, was appointed master of the horse by Quintus Fulvius, thedictator."Book 27,Chapter 6,"After the dictator had arrived at Rome, he sent Cneius SemproniusBlaesus, who had acted under him as lieutenant general at Capua, intothe province of Etruria, to take the command of the army there, in theroom of the praetor, Caius Calpurnius, whom he had summoned by letterto take the command of Capua and his own army. He fixed the first datehe could for the election: which, however, could not be brought toa conclusion, in consequence of a dispute which arose between thetribunes and the dictator. The junior century of the Galerian tribe,to whose lot it fell to give the votes first, had named QuintusFulvius and Quintus Fabius as consuls; and the other centuries,on being called upon to vote according to their course, would haveinclined the same way, had not the plebeian tribunes, Caius and LuciusArennius interposed. They said, ""that it was hardly constitutionalthat a chief magistrate should be continued in office but that it wasa precedent still more shocking, that the very person who held theelection should be appointed. Then therefore, if the dictatorshould allow his own name to appear they would interpose against theelection; but if the names of any other persons besides himself wereput up, they should not impede it."" The dictator defended the electionby the authority of the fathers, the order of the commons, andprecedents. For, ""in the consulate of Cneius Servilius, when the otherconsul, Caius Flaminius, had fallen at Trasimenus, it was proposedto the people on the authority of the fathers, and the people hadordered, that as long as the war continued in Italy, it should belawful for the people to elect to the consulship whomsoever theypleased, out of those persons who had been consuls, and as often asthey pleased. That he had a precedent of ancient date, which was tothe point, in the case of Lucius Posthumius Megellus, who, while hewas interrex, had been created consul with Caius Junius Bubulcus, atan election over which he himself presided; and a precedent of recentdate, in Quintus Fabius, who certainly would never have allowedhimself to be re-elected, had it not been for the good of the state.""After the contest had been continued for a long time, by argumentsof this kind, at length the tribunes and the dictator came to anagreement, that they should abide by what the senate should decide.The fathers were of opinion, that such was then the condition of thestate, that it was necessary that its affairs should be conducted byold and experienced generals, who were skilled in the art of war;and, therefore, that no delay should take place in the election. Thetribunes then withdrew their opposition, and the election was held.Quintus Fabius Maximus was declared consul for the fifth time,and Quintus Fulvius Flaccus for the fourth. The praetors were thencreated; Lucius Veturius Philo, Titus Quintus Crispinus, CaiusHostilius Tubulus, and Caius Aurunculeius. The magistrates for theyear being appointed, Quintus Fulvius resigned the dictatorship. Atthe end of this summer, a Carthaginian fleet of forty ships, under thecommand of Hamilcar, passed over to Sardinia. At first it laid wastethe territory of Olbia, and then Publius Manlius Vulso, with his army,making his appearance, it sailed round thence to the other side of theisland, and devastating the territory of Caralis, returned to Africawith booty of every kind. Several Roman priests died this year, andothers were substituted. Caius Servilius was appointed pontiff, in theplace of Titus Otacilius Crassus. Tiberius Sempronius Longus, sonof Tiberius, was appointed as augur, in the place of Titus OtaciliusCrassus; and Tiberius Sempronius Longus, son of Tiberius, wasappointed decemvir for the performance of sacred rites, in the room ofTiberius Sempronius Longus, son of Caius. Marcus Marcius, king of thesacred rites, and Marcus Aemilius Papus, chief curio, died; but nopriests were appointed to succeed them this year. The censors thisyear were Lucius Veturius Philo, and Publius Licinius Crassus chiefpontiff. Licinius Crassus had neither been consul nor praetor beforehe was appointed censor, he stepped from the aedileship to thecensorship. These censors neither chose the senate, nor transacted anypublic business, the death of Lucius Veturius prevented it; on thisLicinius also gave up his office. The curule aediles, Lucius Veturiusand Publius Licinius Varus, repeated the Roman games during one day.The plebeian aediles, Quintus Catius and Lucius Porcius Licinius,furnished brazen statues for the temple of Ceres, out of the moneyarising from fines, and exhibited games with great pomp and splendour,considering the circumstances of the times."Book 27,Chapter 7,"At the close of this year, Caius Laelius, the lieutenant generalof Scipio, came to Rome on the thirty-fourth day after he set out fromTarraco, and entering the city accompanied by a train of captives,drew together a great concourse of people. The next day, on beingbrought into the senate, he stated that Carthage, the capital ofSpain, had been captured in one day, that several cities which hadrevolted were regained, and that fresh ones had been received intoalliance. From the prisoners, information was gained, correspondingfor the most part with what was contained in the letter of MarcusValerius Messala. What produced the greatest effect upon the fathers,was the march of Hasdrubal into Italy, which was with difficultyresisting Hannibal and his forces. Laelius also, who was broughtbefore the general assembly, gave a particular statement of the samethings. The senate decreed a supplication for one day, on account ofthe successes of Publius Scipio, and ordered Caius Laelius to returnas soon as possible to Spain, with the ships he had brought with him.I have laid the taking of Carthage in this year, on the authority ofmany writers, although aware that some have stated that it was takenthe following year, because it appeared to me hardly probable thatScipio should have spent an entire year in Spain in doing nothing.Quintus Fabius Maximus for the fifth time, and Quintus Fulvius Flaccusfor the fourth having entered on their offices of consuls on the idesof March, on the same day, Italy was decreed as the province of both,their command, however, was distributed to separate districts. Fabiuswas appointed to carry on the war at Tarentum; Fulvius in Lucania andBruttium. Marcus Claudius was continued in command for the year. Thepraetors then cast lots for their provinces. Caius Hostilius Tubulusobtained the city jurisdiction; Lucius Veturius Philo the foreign,with Gaul; Titus Quinctius Crispinus, Capua; Caius Aurunculeius,Sardinia. The troops were thus distributed through the provinces:Fulvius received the two legions which Marcus Valerius Laevinus had inSicily; Quintus Fabius, those which Caius Calpurnius had commandedin Etruria. The city troops were to succeed those in Etruria; CaiusCalpurnius commanding the same province and the army. Titus Quinctiuswas to take the command of Capua, and the army which had served underQuintus Fulvius there. Lucius Veturius was to succeed Caius Laetorius,propraetor, in his province and the command of the army, which wasthen at Ariminum. Marcus Marcellus had the legions with which he hadbeen successful when consul. To Marcus Valerius together with LuciusCincius, for these also were continued in command in Sicily, thetroops which had fought at Cannae were given, with orders to recruitthem out of the surviving soldiers of the legions of Cneius Fulvius.These were collected and sent by the consuls into Sicily, and the sameignominious condition of service was added, under which the troopswhich had fought at Cannae served, and to those troops belonging tothe army of Cneius Fulvius, the praetor, which had been sent thitherby the senate through displeasure occasioned by a similar flight.Caius Aurunculeius was appointed to command, in Sardinia, the samelegions with which Publius Manlius Vulso had occupied that province.Publius Sulpicius was continued in command for the year, with ordersto hold Macedonia with the same legion and fleet. Orders were givento send thirty quinqueremes from Sicily to Tarentum, to the consulFabius. With the rest of the ships, orders were given that MarcusValerius Laevinus should either pass over himself into Africa toravage the country, or send either Lucius Cincius or Marcus ValeriusMessala. With regard to Spain, no alteration was made, except thatScipio and Silanus were continued in command, not for the year, butuntil they should be recalled by the senate. In such manner were theprovinces and the commands of the armies distributed for this year."Book 27,Chapter 8,"Amid concerns of greater importance, an old dispute was revived atthe election of a chief curio, when a priest was appointed to succeedMarcus Aemilius; the patricians denying that Caius Mamilius Vitulus,who was a plebeian candidate, ought to be allowed to stand, because noone before his time had held that priesthood who was not a patrician.The tribunes, on being appealed to, referred the matter to the senate.The senate left it to the decision of the people. Thus Caius MamiliusVitulus was the first plebeian created chief curio. Publius Licinius,chief pontiff, compelled Caius Valerius Flaccus to be inauguratedflamen of Jupiter, against his will. Caius Valerius Laetorius wascreated decemvir for the performance of sacred rites, in the room ofQuintus Mucius Scaevola, deceased. I should willingly have passed overin silence the reason of a flamen's being compelled to be inaugurated,had he not become a good, from having been a bad character. Inconsequence of having spent his youth in idleness and debauchery,vices for which he had incurred the displeasure of his own brother,Lucius Flaccus, and the rest of his kinsmen, Caius Flaccus was chosenflamen by Publius Licinius, chief pontiff. As soon as his mind becameoccupied with the care of the sacred rites and ceremonies, he soon socompletely divested himself of his former habits, that no one amongall the youth was more esteemed, or enjoyed in a greater degree theapprobation of the chief of the patricians, whether relations oraliens. Being raised by this generally good character to a properconfidence in himself, he claimed to be admitted into the senate; athing intermitted for many years, on account of the worthlessness offormer flamens. On entering the senate, Lucius Licinius, the praetor,led him out; on which the flamen appealed to the tribunes of thepeople. He demanded back the ancient privilege of his priesthood,which was given, together with the purple-bordered robe, and thecurule chair, to the office of flamen. The praetor wished the questionto rest not on the precedents contained in the annals, which wereobsolete from their antiquity, but on the usual practice in all thecases of most recent date; urging, that no flamen of Jupiter, inthe memory of their fathers or their grandfathers, had taken up thatprivilege. The tribunes giving it as their opinion, that justicerequired, that as the obliteration of the privilege was occasioned bythe negligence of the flamens, the consequences ought to fall upon theflamens themselves, and not upon the office, led the flamen into thesenate, with the general approbation of the fathers, and without anyopposition, even from the praetor himself; while all were of opinionthat the flamen had obtained his object more from the purity of hislife, than any right appertaining to the priesthood. The consuls,before they departed to their provinces, raised two legions for thecity, and as many soldiers as were necessary to make up the numbersof the other armies. The consul Fulvius appointed his brother, CaiusFulvius Flaccus, lieutenant-general, to march the old city army intoEtruria, and to bring to Rome the legions which were in Etruria. Andthe consul Fabius ordered his son, Quintus Fabius Maximus, to lead theremains of the army of Fulvius, which had been collected, amountingto three thousand three hundred and thirty-six, into Sicily to MarcusValerius, the proconsul, and to receive from him two legions andthirty quinqueremes. The withdrawing of these legions from the islanddid not at all diminish the force employed for the protection of thatprovince, either in effect or appearance; for though, in addition totwo veteran legions which were most effectively reinforced, he hada great number of Numidian deserters, both horse and foot, he raisedalso a body of Sicilian troops, consisting of men who had served inthe armies of Epicydes and the Carthaginians, and were experiencedin war. Having added these foreign auxiliaries to each of the Romanlegions, he preserved the appearance of two armies. With one heordered Lucius Cinctius to protect that portion of the island whichhad formed the kingdom of Hiero, with the other he himself guarded therest of the island, which was formerly divided by the boundary of theRoman and Carthaginian dominions. He divided also the fleet of seventyships, in order that it might protect the sea-coast, through theentire extent of its shores. He himself went through the island withthe cavalry of Mutines to inspect the lands, observe those which werecultivated and those which were not, and, accordingly, either praiseor reprove the owners. By this diligence so large a quantity of cornwas produced, that he both sent some to Rome, and collected at Catanacorn which might serve as a supply for the army, which was about topass the summer at Tarentum."Book 27,Chapter 9,"But the transportation of the soldiers into Sicily, and theyconsisted chiefly of Latins and allies, had very nearly caused aserious commotion; from such trifling circumstances do events of greatimportance frequently arise. A murmuring arose among the Latins andallies at their meetings. They said, that ""they had been drained bylevies and contributions for ten years. That almost every year theyfought with the most disastrous consequences. That some of themwere slain in the field, others were carried off by disease. That acountryman of theirs who was enlisted by the Romans was more lost tothem than one who was taken prisoner by the Carthaginians; for thelatter was sent back to his country by the enemy without ransom, whilethe former was sent beyond the limits of Italy, into exile rather thanmilitary service. That the troops which fought at Cannae were growingold there, for eight years, and would die there before the enemy,who was now more than ever flourishing and vigorous would depart fromItaly. If the old soldiers did not return to their country, and freshones were enlisted, that in a short time there would be no one left.That, therefore, they must refuse to the Roman people, before theycame to utter desolation and want, what shortly their very conditionwould refuse. If the Romans saw their allies unanimous on thispoint that they would then certainly think of making peace with theCarthaginians; otherwise, Italy would never be without war whileHannibal was alive."" Thus they discoursed in their meetings. The Romanpeople had at that time thirty colonies. Twelve of these, for they allhad embassies in Rome, told the consuls that they had not whence tofurnish either men or money. The twelve were Ardea, Nepete Sutrium,Alba, Carseoli, Cora, Suessa, Cerceii, Setia, Cales Narnia, Interamna.The consuls, astonished at this new proceeding, were desirous to deterthem from so hateful a measure and, considering that they could effectthis better by censure and remonstrance than by mild means, said that""they had dared to say to the consuls what the consuls could not bringtheir minds to declare in the senate; for that this was not refusal toperform military service, but an open defection from the Roman people.They desired, therefore, that they would return to their coloniesspeedily, and that, considering the subject as untouched, as they hadonly spoken of, but not attempted, so impious a business, they wouldconsult with their countrymen. That they would warn them that theywere not Campanians or Tarentines, but Romans; that from thence theyderived their origin, and thence were sent out into colonies and landscaptured from the enemy, for the purpose of increasing the population.That they owed to the Romans what children owed to parents, if theypossessed any natural affection, or any gratitude towards their mothercountry. That they should, therefore, consider the matter afresh; forthat certainly what they then so rashly meditated, was the betrayingthe Roman empire, and putting the victory in the hands of Hannibal.""The consuls having spent a long time in exchanging arguments of thiskind, the ambassadors, who were not at all moved by what they said,declared, that ""they had nothing which they could carry home, norhad their senate any thing fresh to devise, having neither men to beenlisted, nor money to be furnished for pay."" The consuls, seeing thatthey were inflexible, laid the matter before the senate; where thealarm excited in the minds of all was so great, that ""the greaterpart declared it was all over with the empire; that the rest of thecolonies would take the same course, and that all the allies hadconspired to betray the city of Rome to Hannibal."""Book 27,Chapter 10,"The consuls endeavoured to encourage and console the senate,telling them that ""the other colonies would maintain their allegiance,and continue in their former state of dutiful obedience, and thatthose very colonies who had renounced their allegiance, would beinspired with respect for the empire, if ambassadors were sent roundto them to reprove and not entreat them."" The senate having given thempermission to do and to act as they might conceive best for the state;after sounding the intentions of the other colonies, the consulssummoned their ambassadors, and asked them whether they had theirsoldiers ready according to the roll? Marcus Sextilius of Fregellaereplied, in behalf of the eighteen colonies, that ""they both had theirsoldiers ready according to the roll, and if more were wanting wouldfurnish more, and would perform with all diligence whatever else theRoman people commanded and wished; that to do this they wanted notmeans, and of inclination they had more than enough."" The consuls,having first told them that any praises bestowed by themselves aloneseemed too little for their deserts, unless the whole body of thefathers should thank them in the senate-house, led them before thesenate. The senate, having voted an address to them conceived in themost honourable terms, charged the consuls to take them before theassembly of the people; and, among the many other distinguishedservices rendered to themselves and their ancestors, to make mentionalso of this recent obligation conferred upon the state. Nor even atthe present day, after the lapse of so many ages let their names bepassed over in silence, nor let them be defrauded of the praise dueto them. They were the people of Signia, Norba, Saticulum, Brundusium,Fregellae, Lucerium Venusia, Adria, Firma, Ariminum; on the othersea, Pontius Paestum, and Cosa; and in the inland parts Beneventum,Aesernia, Spoletum, Placentia, and Cremona. By the support of thesecolonies the empire of the Roman people then stood; and the thanksboth of the senate and the people were given to them. As to the twelveother colonies which refused obedience, the fathers forbade that theirnames should be mentioned, that their ambassadors should either bedismissed or retained, to be addressed by the consuls. Such a tacitreproof appears most consistent with the dignity of the Roman people.While the consuls were getting in readiness all the other things whichwere necessary for the war, it was resolved that the vicesimary gold,which was preserved in the most sacred part of the treasury as aresource in cases of extreme exigencies should be drawn out. Therewere drawn out as many as four thousand pounds of gold, from whichfive hundred pounds each were given to the consuls, to MarcusMarcellus and Publius Sulpicius, proconsuls, and Lucius Veturius,the praetor, who had by lot obtained Gaul as his province; and inaddition, one hundred pounds of gold were given to the consul Fabius,as an extraordinary grant to be carried into the citadel of Tarentum.The rest they employed in contracts, for ready money, for clothingfor the army which was carrying on the war in Spain, to their own andtheir general glory."Book 27,Chapter 11,"It was resolved also, that the prodigies should be expiated beforethe consuls set out from the city. In the Alban mount, the statue ofJupiter and a tree near the temple were struck by lightning; at Ostia,a grove; at Capua, a wall and the temple of Fortune; at Sinuessa, awall and a gate. Some also asserted, that water at Alba had flowedtinged with blood. That at Rome, within the cell of Fors Fortuna, animage, which was in the crown of the goddess, had fallen spontaneouslyfrom her head into her hands. At Privernum, it was satisfactorilyestablished that an ox spoke, and that a vulture flew down intoa shop, while the forum was crowded. And that a child was born atSinuessa, of ambiguous sex, between a male and female, such as arecommonly called Androgynes, a term derived from the Greek language,which is better adapted, as for most other purposes, so for thecomposition of words; also that it rained milk, and that a boy wasborn with the head of an elephant. These prodigies were then expiatedwith victims of the larger kind, and a supplication at every shrineand an offering up of prayers, was proclaimed for one day. It was alsodecreed, that Caius Hostilius, the praetor, should vow and performthe games in honour of Apollo as they had of late years been vowed andperformed. During the same time, Quintus Fulvius, the consul, held anelection for the creation of censors. Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, andPublius Sempronius Tuditanus, both of whom had not yet been consuls,were created censors. The question was put to the people on theauthority of the fathers, and the people ordered that these censorsshould let to farm the Campanian lands. The choosing of the senatewas delayed by a dispute which arose between the censors about theselection of a chief of the senate. The choice belonged to Sempronius;but Cornelius contended that the custom handed down by their fathersmust be followed, which was, that they should choose him as chief ofthe senate who was first censor of those who were then alive; this wasTitus Manlius Torquatus. Sempronius rejoined, that to whom the godshad given the lot of choosing, to him the same gods had given theright of exercising his discretion freely. That he would act in thisaffair according to his own free will, and would choose Quintus FabiusMaximus, whom he would prove to be the first man in the Roman state,even in the judgment of Hannibal. After a long verbal dispute, hiscolleague giving up the point, Quintus Fabius Maximus, the consul, waschosen, by Sempronius, chief of the senate. Another senate was thenchosen, and eight names were passed over; among which was thatof Lucius Caecilius Metellus, disrespected as the adviser of theabandonment of Italy, after the defeat at Cannae. In censuring thoseof the equestrian order, the same ground was acted upon, but therewere very few to whom that disgrace belonged. All of the equestrianorder belonging to the legions who had fought at Cannae, and were thenin Sicily, were deprived of their horses. To this severe punishmentthey added another relating to time, which was, that the past campaignwhich they had served on horses furnished at the public expense shouldnot be reckoned to them, but that they should serve ten campaigns onhorses furnished at their own expense. They also searched for, anddiscovered, a great number of those who ought to have served in thecavalry; and all those who were seventeen years old at the beginningof the war and had not served, they disfranchised. They thencontracted for the restoration of the seven shops, the shamble and theroyal palace, situated round the forum, and which had been consumed byfire."Book 27,Chapter 12,"Having finished every thing which was to be done in Rome, theconsuls set out for the war. Fulvius first went advance to Capua; ina few days Fabius followed. He implored his colleague in person,and Marcellus by a letter use the most vigorous measures to detainHannibal, while he was making an attack upon Tarentum. That when thatcity was taken from the enemy, who had been repulsed on all sides andhad no place where he might make a stand or look back up as a saferetreat, he would not then have even a pretext for remaining in Italy.He also sent a messenger to Rhegium, the praefect of the garrison,which had been placed there the consul Laevinus, against theBruttians, and consisted eight thousand men, the greater part ofwhom had been brought from Agathyrna in Sicily, as has been beforementioned, and were men who had been accustomed to live by rapine. Tothese were added fugitives of the Bruttians natives of that country,equal to them in daring, and under an equal necessity of bravingevery thing. This band ordered to be marched, first, to lay waste theBruttian territory, and then to attack the city Caulonia. After havingexecuted the order, not only with alacrity, but avidity, and havingpillaged and put to flight the cultivators of the land they attackedthe city with the utmost vigour. Marcellus incited by the letter ofthe consul, and because he had made up his mind that no Roman generalwas so good a match for Hannibal as himself, set out from his winterquarters as soon as there was plenty of forage in the fields, and metHannibal at Canusium. The Carthaginian was then endeavouring to inducethe Canusians to revolt, but as soon as he heard that Marcellus wasapproaching, he decamped thence. The country was open, without anycovers adapted for an ambuscade; he therefore began to retire thenceinto woody districts. Marcellus closely pursued him, pitched his campclose to his, and when he had completed his works, led out his troopsinto the field. Hannibal engaged in slight skirmishes, and sentout single troops of horse and the spearmen from his infantry, notconsidering it necessary to hazard a general battle. He was, however,drawn on to a contest of that kind which he was avoiding. Hannibal haddecamped by night, but was overtaken by Marcellus in a plain and opencountry. Then, while encamping, Marcellus, by attacking the workmenon all hands, prevented the completion of his works. Thus a pitchedbattle ensued, and all their forces were brought into action; butnight coming on, they retired from an equal contest. They then hastilyfortified their camps, which were a small space apart, before night.The next day, as soon as it was light, Marcellus led out his troopsinto the field; nor did Hannibal decline the challenge, but exhortedhis soldiers at great length, desiring them ""to remember Trasimenusand Cannae, and thus quell the proud spirit of their enemies."" Hesaid, ""the enemy pressed upon him, and trod upon their heels; that hedid not allow them to pass unmolested, pitch their camp, or even takebreath and look around them; that every day, the rising sun and theRoman troops in battle-array were to be seen together on the plains.But if in one battle he should retire from the field, not without lossof blood, he would then prosecute the war more steadily and quietly.""Fired by these exhortations, and at the same time wearied with thepresumption of the enemy, who daily pressed upon them and provokedthem to an engagement, they commenced the battle with spirit. Thebattle continued for more than two hours, when the right wing ofthe allies and the chosen band began to give way on the part of theRomans; which Marcellus perceiving, led the eighteenth legion to thefront. While some were retiring in confusion, and others werecoming up reluctantly, the whole line was thrown into disorder, andafterwards completely routed; while their fears getting the better oftheir sense of shame, they turned their backs. In the battle and inthe flight there fell as many as two thousand seven hundred of thecitizens and allies; among which were four Roman centurions and twomilitary tribunes, Marcus Licinius and Marcus Helvius. Four militarystandards were lost by the wing which first fled, and two belonging tothe legion which came up in place of the retiring allies."Book 27,Chapter 13,"Marcellus, on his return to the camp, delivered an address tohis soldiers so severe and acrimonious, that the words of theirexasperated general were more painful to them than what they hadsuffered in the unsuccessful battle during the whole day. ""I praiseand thank the immortal gods,"" said he ""that in such an affair thevictorious enemy did not assail our very camp, when you were hurryinginto the rampart and the gates with such consternation. There can beno doubt but you would have abandoned the camp with the same cowardicewith which you gave up the battle. What panic was this? What terror?What sudden forgetfulness of who you are, and who the persons withwhom you were fighting, took possession of your minds? Surely theseare the same enemies in conquering and pursuing whom when conqueredyou spent the preceding summer; whom latterly you have been closelypursuing while they fled before you night and day; whom you havewearied by partial battles; whom yesterday you would not allow eitherto march or encamp. I pass over those things in which you might beallowed to glory; I will mention a circumstance which of itself oughtto fill you with shame and remorse. Yesterday you separated from theenemy on equal terms. What alteration has last night, what on thisday, produced? Have your forces been diminished by them, or theirsincreased? I verily do not seem to be talking to my own troops, orto Roman soldiers. The bodies and the arms are the same. Had youpossessed the same spirit, would the enemy have seen your backs? Wouldthey have carried off a standard from any company or cohort? Hithertohe was wont to boast of having cut to pieces the Roman legions, butyesterday you gave him the glory, for the first time, of having putto flight an army."" On this many soldiers began to call upon him topardon them for that day, and entreat that he would now, whenever hepleased, make trial of the courage of his soldiers. ""I will indeedmake trial of you,"" said he, ""and to-morrow I will lead you into thefield, that in the character of conquerors, rather than conquered men,you may obtain the pardon you seek."" To the cohorts which hadlost their standards, he ordered that barley should be given. Thecenturions of the Campanians, whose standards were lost, he left tostand without their girdles and with their swords drawn; and gaveorders that all, both horse and foot, should be ready under armson the following day. Thus the assembly was dismissed; the soldiersconfessing that they had been justly and deservedly rebuked; and thatthere was no one in the whole Roman army who had acquitted himselflike a man, except the general, to whom they were bound to makeatonement, either by their death or a glorious victory. The nextday they appeared in readiness, according to the order, armed andequipped. The general praised them, and gave out, that ""he shouldlead into the first line those who had commenced the flight on thepreceding day, and those cohorts which had lost their standards. Henow charged them all to fight and conquer, and exert every effort, oneand all, that the intelligence of yesterday's flight might not arriveat Rome before that of this day's victory."" They were then orderedto refresh themselves with food, in order that, if the fight shouldcontinue longer than might be expected, their strength might not fail.After every thing had been done and said, by which the courage of thesoldiers might be roused, they advanced into the field."Book 27,Chapter 14,"Hannibal, on receiving intelligence of this, said, ""surely theenemy we have to do with can neither bear good nor bad fortune. If heis victorious, he fiercely pursues the vanquished. If conquered, herenews the contest with the victors."" He then ordered the signal tobe given, and led out his forces. The battle was fought on both sideswith much more spirit than the day before. The Carthaginians exertingthemselves to the utmost, to keep the glory they had acquiredyesterday; the Romans, to remove their disgrace. On the side of theRomans, the left wing, and the cohorts which had lost their standards,fought in the first line, and the twentieth legion was drawn up onthe right wing. Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Caius Claudius Nero,lieutenant-generals, commanded the wings, Marcellus gave vigour to thecentre by his presence, as an encourager and a witness. On the partof Hannibal, the Spaniards, who were the flower of his whole army,occupied the front line. After the battle had continued doubtful fora long time, Hannibal ordered the elephants to be advanced into thefront line, if by that means any confusion or panic could be created.At first, they threw the troops into confusion and broke their ranks,and treading some under foot, and dispersing others who were roundthem by the alarm they created, had made an opening in one part of theRoman line; and the flight would have spread more widely had not CaiusDecimus Flavius, a military tribune seizing the standard of the firstmaniple of the spearmen ordered that maniple to follow him. He ledthem to the spot where the elephants, collected in a body, werecreating the greatest confusion, and ordered them to discharge theirjavelins at them. As there was no difficulty in hitting such bulkybodies at a short distance, and where so many were crowded together,all their javelins stuck in them. But they were not all wounded, sothose in whose hides the javelins stuck, as that race of animals isnot to be depended on, by taking themselves to flight, drove awaythose also which were untouched. At that moment not only one maniple,but all the soldiers who could but overtake the body of retreatingelephants, threw their javelins at them, each man exerting himself tohis utmost. With so much greater impetuosity did the animals rush upontheir own men, and so much greater carnage did they make amongstthem than they had made amongst their enemies, in proportion as theviolence with which they are impelled, and the consternation producedby them when under the influence of fear, is greater than when theyare ruled by their masters seated on their backs. The Roman infantrybore their standards against the line of the enemy when thrown intodisorder by the elephants which had crossed over to them, and,thus scattered and confused, led them to flight without any greatopposition. Marcellus sent his cavalry after them as they fled;nor did they desist from the pursuit till they were driven inconsternation to their camp. For in addition to the other causes whichoccasioned terror and dismay, two elephants had fallen just by thegate, and the soldiers were compelled to rush into the camp over theditch and rampart. Here the greatest slaughter of the enemy occurred.There fell as many as eight thousand men and five elephants. Nor didthe Romans gain a bloodless victory; about seventeen hundred of thetwo legions, and thirteen hundred of the allies were slain; a greatnumber of the Romans and allies were wounded. The following nightHannibal decamped. The great number of the wounded prevented Marcellusfrom following him, as he desired."Book 27,Chapter 15,"The spies who were sent to watch his movements brought word backthe next day that Hannibal was making for Bruttium. Much aboutthe same time the Hirpinians, Lucanians, and Volcentes surrenderedthemselves to the consul, Quintus Fulvius, delivering up the garrisonsof Hannibal which they had in their cities. They were mildly receivedby the consul, with only a verbal reproof for their past error. Tothe Bruttians also similar hopes of pardon were held out, when twobrothers, Vibius and Pactius, by far the most illustrious persons ofthat nation, came from them to solicit the same terms of surrenderwhich had been given to the Lucanians. Quintus Fabius, the consul,took by storm Manduria, a town in the territory of Sallentum, whereas many as four thousand men were made prisoners, and much booty takenbesides. Proceeding thence to Tarentum, he pitched his camp in thevery mouth of the harbour: of the ships which Livius had employed forprotecting convoys, some he loaded with engines and implements forattacking walls, others he furnished with machines for dischargingmissiles, and with stones and missiles of every kind; not only thosewhich were impelled with oars, but the storeships also, in order thatsome might carry the engines and ladders to the walls, while othersmight wound the defenders of the walls by discharging missiles fromthe ships at a distance. These ships were fitted up and preparedto attack the town from the open sea; and the sea was free from theCarthaginian fleet, which had crossed over to Corcyra on account ofPhilip's preparing to attack the Aetolians. Meanwhile, those who wereattacking Caulon, in the territory of Bruttium, fearful lest theyshould be overpowered, had retired on the approach of Hannibal to aneminence, secure from an immediate attack. While Fabius was besiegingTarentum, he received assistance in the accomplishment of that greatobject by a circumstance which in the mere mention, is unimportant.Tarentum was occupied by a garrison of Bruttians, given them byHannibal and the commander of that garrison was desperately in lovewith a girl, whose brother was in the army of the consul Fabius. Beinginformed, by a letter from his sister, of the new acquaintance shehad formed with a wealthy stranger and one so honoured among hiscountrymen, and conceiving a hope that the lover, by means of hissister, might be induced to any thing she pleased, he acquaintedthe consul with the hope he had formed. His reasoning appeared notaltogether unfounded, and he was desired to go to Tarentum as adeserter and having gained the confidence of the praefect by means ofhis sister, he began by sounding his disposition in a covert manner,and then, having sufficiently ascertained his weakness, induced him,by the aid of female fascinations, to the betrayal of that custody ofthe place to which he was appointed. After the method to be pursuedand the time for putting the plan into effect had been agreed upon, asoldier, who was sent out of the city by night clandestinely, throughthe intervals between the guards, related to the consul what had beendone, and what had been agreed upon to be done. At the first watch,Fabius, on a signal given to those who were in the citadel, and thosewho had the custody of the harbour went himself round the harbour, andtook up a position of concealment, on the side of the city which facedthe east. Then the trumpets began to sound at once from the citadel,the harbour, and the ships which had been brought to the shore fromthe open sea, and a shout was purposely raised, accompanied with thegreatest confusion, in whatever quarter there was the least danger.Meanwhile, the consul kept the men in silence. Democrates, therefore,who had formerly commanded the fleet, and happened to be in command inthe quarter, seeing that all was quiet around him, while other partsof the city resounded with such a din that sometimes shout like thatof a captured city was raised, and fearing loss while he hesitated,the consul should make some attack and advance his standards, ledhis party over to the citadel, from which the most alarming noiseproceeded. Fabius, concluding that the guard was withdrawn, both fromthe time which had elapsed and from the silence which prevailed, fornot a voice met the ear from a quarter where a little while ago thenoise and bustle of men resounded, rousing and calling each other toarms, ordered the ladders to be carried to that part of the wall wherethe person who had contrived the plot for betraying the city, hadinformed him that the Bruttian cohort kept guard. The wall was firstcaptured in that quarter, the Bruttians aiding and receiving theRomans; and here they got over into the city: after which the nearestgate was broken open in order that the troops might enter in a largebody. Then raising a shout, they proceeded to the forum, where theyarrived much about daybreak, without meeting a single armed man; anddrew upon themselves the attention of all the troops in every quarter,which were fighting at the citadel and at the harbour."Book 27,Chapter 16,"A battle was fought in the entrance of the forum, with greaterimpetuosity than perseverance. The Tarentines were not equal to theRomans in spirit, in their arms, in tactics, in activity or strengthof body. Accordingly, having just discharged their javelins, theyturned their backs almost before they had joined battle, and escapedin different directions through the streets of the city, with whichthey were acquainted, to their own houses and those of their friends.Two of their leaders, Nico and Democrates, fell while fightingbravely. Philomenus, who was the author of the plot for betraying thecity to Hannibal, rode away from the battle at full speed. Shortlyafter, his horse, which was loose and straying through the city,was recognised, but his body could not be found any where. It wasgenerally believed that he had pitched headlong from his horse into anopen well. Carthalo, the praefect of the Carthaginian garrison, whilecoming to the consul unarmed, to put him in mind of a connexion ofhospitality which subsisted between their fathers, was put to deathby a soldier who met him. The rest were put to the sword on all hands,armed and unarmed indiscriminately, Carthaginians and Tarentineswithout distinction. Many of the Bruttians also were slain either bymistake or on account of an old grudge entertained against them, orelse with a view to the report that the city was betrayed; in orderthat Tarentum might rather appear to have been captured by force ofarms. The troops then ran off in all directions from the slaughter,to plunder the city. Thirty thousand slaves are said to havebeen captured; an immense quantity of silver, wrought and coined;eighty-three thousand pounds of gold; of statues and pictures so manythat they almost equalled the decorations of Syracuse. But Fabius,with more magnanimity than Marcellus, abstained from booty of thatkind. When his secretary asked him what he wished to be done with thestatues of their gods, which are of immense size and represented asfighting, each having his peculiar habit, he gave orders that theirangry gods should be left in the possession of the Tarentines. Afterthis, the wall which separated the city from the citadel was razed anddemolished. While things were going on thus at Tarentum, Hannibal,to whom the troops engaged in the siege of Caulonia had surrenderedthemselves, hearing of the siege of Tarentum, marched with thegreatest expedition both night and day; but hearing that the city wastaken, as he was hastening to bring assistance to it, he exclaimed,""the Romans too have their Hannibal. We have lost Tarentum by the samearts by which we took it."" However, that he might not appear to haveturned his army in the manner of a fugitive, he encamped where hehad halted, about five miles from the city. After staying there afew days, he retired to Metapontum, from which place he sent twoMetapontines with letters from the principal men in the state toFabius at Tarentum, to the effect, that they would accept of hispromise that their past conduct should be unpunished, on conditionof their betraying Metapontum together with the Carthaginian garrisoninto his hands. Fabius, who supposed that the communication theybrought was genuine, appointed a day on which he would go toMetapontum, and gave the letters to the nobles, which were put intothe hands of Hannibal. He, forsooth, delighted at the success of hisstratagem, which showed that not even Fabius was proof against hiscunning, planted an ambuscade not far from Metapontum. But when Fabiuswas taking the auspices, before he took his departure from Tarentum,the birds more than once refused approval. Also, on consulting thegods after sacrificing a victim, the aruspex forewarned him to be onhis guard against hostile treachery and ambuscade. After the day fixedfor his arrival had passed without his coming, the Metapontines weresent again to encourage him, delaying, but they were instantly seized,and, from apprehension of a severer mode of examination, disclosed theplot."Book 27,Chapter 17,"In the beginning of the summer during which these events occurred,after Publius Scipio had employed the whole of the winter in Spain inregaining the affections of the barbarians, partly by presents, andpartly by sending home their hostages and prisoners, Edesco, a mandistinguished among the Spanish commanders, came to him. His wife andchildren were in the hands of the Romans; but besides this motive,he was influenced by that apparently fortuitous turn in the state offeeling which had converted the whole of Spain from the Carthaginianto the Roman cause. The same motive induced Indibilis and Mandonius,who were undoubtedly the principal men in all Spain, to desertHasdrubal and withdraw with the whole body of their countrymen to theeminences which overhung his camp, from which they had a safe retreatalong a chain of hills to the Romans. Hasdrubal, perceiving that thestrength of the enemy was increasing by such large accessions, whilehis own was diminishing, and that events would continue to flow in thesame course they had taken, unless by a bold effort he effected somealteration, resolved to come to an engagement as soon as possible.Scipio was still more eager for a battle, as well from hope whichthe success attending his operations had increased, as because hepreferred, before the junction of the enemy's forces, to fight withone general and one army, rather than with their united troops.However, in case he should be obliged to fight with more armies thanone at the same time, he had with some ingenuity augmented his forces;for seeing that there was no necessity for ships, as the whole coastof Spain was clear of Carthaginian fleets, he hauled his ships onshore at Tarraco and added his mariners to his land forces. Hehad plenty of arms for them, both those which had been captured atCarthage, and those which he had caused to be made after its capture,so large a number of workmen having been employed. With these forces,setting out from Tarraco at the commencement of the spring, forLaelius had now returned from Rome, without whom he wished nothingof very great importance to be attempted, Scipio marched against theenemy. Indibilis and Mandonius, with their forces, met him while onhis march; passing through every place Without molestation, hisallies receiving him courteously, and escorting him as he passed theboundaries of each district. Indibilis, who spoke for both, addressedhim by no means stupidly and imprudently like a barbarian, but with amodest gravity, rather excusing the change as necessary, than gloryingthat the present opportunity had been eagerly seized as the firstwhich had occurred. ""For he well knew,"" he said, ""that the name ofa deserter was an object of execration to former allies, and ofsuspicion to new ones; nor did he blame the conduct of mankind inthis respect, provided, however, that the cause, and not the name,occasioned the twofold hatred."" He then recounted the services theyhad rendered the Carthaginian generals, and on the other hand theirrapacity and insolence, together with the injuries of every kindcommitted against themselves and their countrymen. ""On this account,""he said, ""his person only up to that time had been with them, hisheart had long since been on that side where he believed thatright and justice were respected. That people sought for refuge,as suppliants, even with the gods when they could not endure theoppression and injustice of men. What he had to entreat of Scipiowas, that their passing over to him might neither be the occasion ofa charge of fraud nor a ground for respect, but that he would estimatetheir services according to what sort of men he should find them to befrom experience from that day."" The Roman replied, that ""he would doso in every particular; nor would he consider those men as deserterswho did not look upon an alliance as binding where no law, divine orhuman, was unviolated."" Their wives and children were then broughtbefore them and restored to them; on which occasion they wept for joy.On that day they were conducted to a lodging; on the following theywere received as allies, by a treaty, after which they were sent tobring up their forces. From that time they had their tents in the samecamp with the Romans, until under their guidance they had reached theenemy."Book 27,Chapter 18,"The army of Hasdrubal, which was the nearest of the Carthaginianarmies, lay near the city Baecula. Before his camp he had outpostsof cavalry. On these the light-armed, those who fought before thestandards and those who composed the vanguard, as they came upfrom their march, and before they chose the ground for their camp,commenced an attack in so contemptuous a manner, that it was perfectlyevident what degree of spirit each party possessed. The cavalry weredriven into their camp in disorderly flight, and the Roman standardswere advanced almost within their very gates. Their minds on that dayhaving only been excited to a contest, the Romans pitched their camp.At night Hasdrubal withdrew his forces to an eminence, on the summitof which extended a level plain. There was a river on the rear, infront and on either side a kind of steep bank completely surroundedits extremity. Beneath this and lower down was another plain ofgentle declivity, which was also surrounded by a similar ridge equallydifficult of ascent. Into this lower plain Hasdrubal, the next day,when he saw the troops of the enemy drawn up before their camp, senthis Numidian cavalry and light-armed Baleares. Scipio riding out tothe companies and battalions, pointed out to them, that ""the enemyhaving abandoned, beforehand, all hope of being able to withstandthem on level ground, had resorted to hills: where they stood in view,relying on the strength of their position, and not on their valour andarms."" But the walls of Carthage, which the Roman soldiers had scaled,were still higher. That neither hills, nor a citadel, nor even the seaitself, had formed an impediment to their arms. That the heightswhich the enemy had occupied would only have the effect of making itnecessary for them to leap down crags and precipices in their flight,but he would even cut off that kind of retreat. He accordingly gaveorders to two cohorts, that one of them should occupy the entrance ofthe valley down which the river ran, and that the other should blockup the road which led from the city into the country, over the sideof the hill. He himself led the light troops, which the day beforehad driven in the advanced guard of the enemy, against the light-armedtroops which were stationed on the lower ridge. At first they marchedthrough rugged ground, impeded by nothing except the road; afterwards,when they came within reach of the darts, an immense quantity ofweapons of every description was showered upon them; while on theirpart, not only the soldiers, but a multitude of servants mingled withthe troops, threw stones furnished by the place, which were spreadabout in every part, and for the most part convenient as missiles. Butthough the ascent was difficult, and they were almost overwhelmed withstones and darts, yet from their practice in approaching walls andtheir inflexibility of mind, the foremost succeeded in getting up.These, as soon as they got upon some level ground and could stand withfirm footing, compelled the enemy, who were light-armed troops adaptedfor skirmishing, and could defend themselves at a distance, where anelusive kind of fight is carried on by the discharge of missiles, butyet wanted steadiness for a close action, to fly from their position;and, killing a great many, drove them to the troops which stood abovethem on the higher eminence. Upon this Seipio, having ordered thevictorious troops to mount up and attack the centre of the enemy,divided the rest of his forces with Laelius; whom he directed to goround the hill to the right till he could find a way of easier ascent,while he himself, making a small circuit to the left, charged theenemy in flank. In consequence of this their line was first throwninto confusion, while they endeavoured to wheel round and face abouttheir ranks towards the shouts which resounded from every quarteraround them. During this confusion Laelius also came up, and while theenemy were retreating, that they might not be exposed to wounds frombehind, their front line became disjoined, and a space was leftfor the Roman centre to mount up; who, from the disadvantage of theground, never could have done so had their ranks stood unbroken withthe elephants stationed in front. While the troops of the enemy werebeing slain on all sides, Scipio, who with his left wing had chargedthe right of the enemy, was chiefly employed in attacking their nakedflank. And now there was not even room to fly; for parties of theRoman troops had blocked up the roads on both sides, right and left,and the gate of the camp was closed by the flight of the general andprincipal officers; added to which was the fright of the elephants,who, when in consternation, were as much feared by them as the enemywere. There were, therefore, slain as many as eight thousand men."Book 27,Chapter 19,"Hasdrubal, having seized upon the treasure before he engaged, nowsent the elephants in advance, and collecting as many of the flyingtroops as he could, directed his course along the river Tagus tothe Pyrenees. Scipio, having got possession of the enemy's camp, andgiving up all the booty to the soldiers, except the persons of freecondition, found, on counting the prisoners, ten thousand foot and twothousand horse. Of these, all who were Spaniards he sent home withoutransom; the Africans he ordered the quaestor to sell. After this, amultitude of Spaniards, consisting of those who had surrendered tohim before and those whom he had captured the preceding day, crowdingaround, one and all saluted him as king; when Scipio, after theherald had obtained silence, declared that ""in his estimation the mosthonourable title was that of general, which his soldiers had conferredupon him. That the name of king, which was in other countries revered,could not be endured at Rome. That they might tacitly consider hisspirit as kingly, if they thought that the highest excellence whichcould be attributed to the human mind, but that they must abstain fromthe use of the term."" Even barbarians were sensible of the greatnessof mind which could from such an elevation despise a name, at thegreatness of which the rest of mankind were overawed. Presentswere then distributed to the petty princes and leading men ofthe Spaniards, and out of the great quantity of horses which werecaptured, he desired Indibilis to select those he liked best to thenumber of three hundred. While the quaestor was selling the Africans,according to the command of the general, he found among them afull-grown youth remarkably handsome; and hearing that he was of royalblood, he sent him to Scipio. On being asked by Scipio ""who he was,of what country, and why at that age he was in the camp?"" he replied,""that he was a Numidian, that his countrymen called him Massiva; thatbeing left an orphan by his father, he was educated by his maternalgrandfather, Gala, the king of the Numidians. That he had passed overinto Spain with his uncle Masinissa, who had lately come with a bodyof cavalry to assist the Carthaginians. That having been prohibited byMasinissa on account of his youth, he had never before been in battle.That the day on which the battle took place with the Romans, he hadclandestinely taken a horse and arms, and, without the knowledge ofhis uncle, gone out into the field, where his horse falling forward,he was thrown headlong, and taken prisoner by the Romans."" Scipio,having ordered that the Numidian should be taken care of, completedthe business which remained to be done on the tribunal, and returningto his pavilion, asked him, when he had been called to him, whether hewished to return to Masinissa? Upon his replying, with tears of joy,that he did indeed desire it, he presented the youth with a gold ring,a vest with a broad purple border, a Spanish cloak with a gold clasp,and a horse completely caparisoned, and then dismissed him, ordering aparty of horse to escort him as far as he chose."Book 27,Chapter 20,"A council was then held respecting the war; when some advised thathe should endeavour to overtake Hasdrubal forthwith. But thinking thathazardous, lest Mago and the other Hasdrubal should unite their forceswith his, he sent a body of troops to occupy the pass of the Pyrenees,and employed the remainder of the summer in receiving the states ofSpain into his alliance. A few days after the battle of Baecula, whenScipio on his return to Tarraco had now cleared the pass of Castulo,the generals, Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, and Mago came from the fartherSpain and joined Hasdrubal; a late assistance after the defeat he hadsustained, though their arrival was somewhat seasonable, for counselwith respect to the further prosecution of the war. They thenconsulted together as to what was the feeling of the Spaniards in thequarters where their several provinces were situated, when Hasdrubal,son of Gisgo, alone gave it as his opinion, that the remotest tract ofSpain which borders on the ocean and Gades, was, as yet, unacquaintedwith the Romans, and might therefore be somewhat friendly to theCarthaginians. Between the other Hasdrubal and Mago it was agreed,that ""Scipio by his good offices had gained the affections of all,both publicly and privately; and that there would be no end ofdesertions till all the Spanish soldiers were removed to the remotestparts of Spain, or were marched over into Gaul. That, therefore,though the Carthaginian senate had not decreed it, Hasdrubal must,nevertheless, march into Italy, the principal seat and object of thewar; and thus at the same time lead away all the Spanish soldiers outof Spain far from the name of Scipio. That the army, which had beendiminished by desertions and defeats, should be recruited by Spanishsoldiers. That Mago, having delivered over his army to Hasdrubal, sonof Gisgo, should himself pass over to the Baleares with a large sum ofmoney to hire auxiliaries; that Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, shouldretire with the army into the remotest part of Lusitania, and avoid anencounter with the Romans. That a body of three thousand horse shouldbe made up for Masinissa, the flower of the whole cavalry; and thathe, shifting about from place to place throughout hither Spain shouldsuccour their allies and commit depredations on the towns and landsof their enemies."" Having adopted these resolutions, the generalsdeparted to put in execution what they had resolved on. Such were thetransactions in Spain of this year. At Rome the reputation of Scipioincreased daily. The capture of Tarentum, though effected by artificemore than valour, was considered honourable to Fabius. The fame ofFulvius was on the wane. Marcellus was even under an ill report, notonly because he had failed in his first battle, but further, becausewhile Hannibal was going wherever he pleased throughout Italy, he hadled his troops to Venusia in the midst of summer to lodge in houses.Caius Publicius Bibulus, a tribune of the people, was hostile to him.This man, ever since the time of his first battle which had failed,had in constant harangues made Claudius obnoxious and odious to thepeople; and now his object was to deprive him of his command. Theconnexions of Marcellus, however, then obtained leave that Marcellus,leaving a lieutenant-general at Venusia, should return to Rome toclear himself of the charges which his enemies were urging, and thatthe question of depriving him of his command should not be agitatedduring his absence. It happened that nearly at the same time,Marcellus, and Quintius Fulvius the consul, came to Rome, the formerto exonerate himself from ignominy, the latter on account of theelections."Book 27,Chapter 21,"The question touching Marcellus's command was debated in theFlaminian circus, in the presence of an immense concourse of plebeiansand persons of every rank. The plebeian tribune accused, not onlyMarcellus, but the nobility generally. ""It was owing,"" he said, ""totheir dishonesty and dilatory conduct, that Hannibal occupied Italy,as though it were his province, for now ten years; that he had passedmore of his life there than at Carthage. That the Roman people wereenjoying the fruits of the prolonged command of Marcellus; that hisarmy, after having been twice defeated, was now spending the summerat Venusia lodged in houses."" Marcellus so completely destroyed theeffect of this harangue of the tribune, by the recital of the serviceshe had rendered, that not only the bill for depriving him of hiscommand was thrown out, but the following day he was created consulby the votes of all the centuries with wonderful unanimity. TitusQuinctius Crispinus, who was then praetor, was joined with him as hiscolleague. The next day Publius Licinius Crassus Dives, then chiefpontiff, Publius Licinius Varus, Sextus Julius Caesar, and QuintusClaudius Flamen were created praetors. At the very time of theelection, the public were thrown into a state of anxiety relative tothe defection of Etruria. Caius Calpurnius, who held that province aspropraetor, had written word that the Arretians had originated sucha scheme. Accordingly Marcellus, consul elect, was immediately sentthither to look into the affair, and if it should appear to him ofsufficient consequence, to send for his army and transfer the war fromApulia to Etruria. The Tuscans, checked by the alarm thus occasioned,desisted. To the ambassadors of Tarentum, who solicited a treaty ofpeace securing to them their liberty and the enjoyment of their ownlaws, the senate answered, that they might return when the consulFabius came to Rome. The Roman and plebeian games were this yearrepeated each for one day. The curule aediles were, Lucius CorneliusCaudinus and Servius Sulpicius Galba; the plebeian aediles, CaiusServilius and Quintus Caecilius Metellus. It was asserted thatServilius was not qualified to be plebeian tribune or aedile, becauseit was satisfactorily established that his father, who, for ten years,was supposed to have been killed by the Boii in the neighbourhood ofMutina, when acting as triumvir for the distribution of lands, wasalive and in the hands of the enemy."Book 27,Chapter 22,"In the eleventh year of the Punic war, Marcus Marcellus, for thefifth time, reckoning in the consulate in which he did not act inconsequence of an informality in his creation, and Titus QuinctiusCrispinus entered upon the office of consuls. To both the consuls theprovince of Italy was decreed, with both the consular armies of theformer year; (the third was then at Venusia, being that which MarcusMarcellus had commanded.) That out of the three armies the consulsmight, choose whichever two they liked, and that the third shouldbe delivered to him to whose lot the province of Tarentum and theterritory of Sallentum fell. The other provinces were thus distributedamong the praetors: Publius Licinius Varus had the city jurisdiction,Publius Licinius Crassus, chief pontiff, the foreign, and whereverthe senate though proper. Sextus Julius Caesar had Sicily, and QuintusClaudius Flamen, Tarentum. Quintus Fulvius Flaccus was to continuein command for a year, and hold the province of Capua, which had beenheld by Titus Quinctius, with one legion. Caius Hostilius Tubuluswas also continued in command, with orders to go into Etruria, in thecapacity of propraetor, and succeed Caius Calpurnius in the commandof the two legions there. Lucius Veturius Philo was also continued incommand, to hold in the capacity of propraetor the same province ofGaul with the same two legions with which he had held it as praetor.The senate decreed the same with respect to Caius Aurunculeius, who,as praetor, had held the province of Sardinia with two legions,which it did in the case of Lucius Veturius, and the question of thecontinuation of his command was proposed to the people. He had inaddition, for the protection of the province, fifty ships whichPublius Scipio had sent from Spain. To Publius Scipio and MarcusSilanus, their present province of Spain and their present armies wereassigned. Of the eighty ships which he had with him, some taken fromItaly and others captured at Carthage, Scipio was ordered to sendfifty to Sardinia, in consequence of a report that great navalpreparations were making at Carthage that year; and that the intentionof the Carthaginians was to blockade the whole coasts of Italy,Sicily, and Sardinia with two hundred ships. In Sicily also thefollowing distribution was made: to Sextus Caesar the troops of Cannaewere assigned; Marcus Valerius Laevinus, who was also continued incommand, was to have the fleet of seventy ships which was at Sicily,adding to it the thirty ships which the preceding year were stationedat Tarentum. With this fleet of a hundred ships he was ordered to passover into Africa, if he thought proper, and collect booty. PubliusSulpicius was also continued in command for a year, to hold theprovince of Macedonia and Greece, with the same fleet. No alterationwas made with regard to the two legions which were at Rome. Permissionwas given to the consuls to enlist as many troops as were necessaryto complete the numbers. This year the Roman empire was defended bytwenty-one legions. Publius Licinius Varus, the city praetor, was alsocommissioned to repair the thirty old men of war which lay at Ostia,and to man twenty new ones with full complements, in order that hemight defend the sea-coast in the neighbourhood hood of Rome with afleet of fifty ships. Caius Calpurnius was ordered not to move hisarmy from Arretium till his successor had arrived. Both he and Tubuluswere ordered to be particularly careful, lest any new plots should beformed in that quarter."Book 27,Chapter 23,"The praetors set out for their provinces. The consul were detainedby religious affairs; for receiving intelligence of several prodigies,they could not easily obtain a favourable appearance from the victims.It was reported from Campania, that two temples, those of Fortuneand Mars, and several sepulchres, had been struck by lightning. FromCumae, so does superstition connect the deities with the most triflingcircumstances, that mice had gnawed some gold in the temple ofJupiter. That an immense swarm of bees had settled in the forum atCasinum. That at Ostia a wall and gate had been struck by lightning.At Caere, that a vulture had flown into the temple of Jupiter.That blood had flowed from a lake at Volsinii. On account of theseprodigies, a supplication was performed for one day. For several days,victims of the larger kind were sacrificed without any favourableappearance, and for a long time the good will of the gods could not beobtained. The fatal event indicated by these portents pointed to thepersons of the consuls, the state being unaffected. The Apollinariangames were first celebrated by Publius Cornelius Sulla, the citypraetor, in the consulate of Quintus Fulvius and Appius Claudius; fromthat time all the city praetors in succession had performed them;but they vowed them for one year only, and fixed no day for theirperformance. This year a grievous pestilence attacked the city and thecountry; it showed itself, however, in protracted rather than fataldiseases. On account of this pestilence supplication was performed inevery street throughout the city; and Publius Licinius Varus, the citypraetor, was ordered to propose to the people a law to the effect,that a vow should be made to perform these games on a stated day forever. He himself was the first who vowed them in this manner, and hecelebrated them on the third day of the nones of July, a day which washenceforth kept sacred."Book 27,Chapter 24,"The reports respecting the people of Arretium became daily moreserious, and the anxiety of the fathers increased. A letter wastherefore written to Caius Hostilius, directing him not to delaytaking hostages from that people; and Caius Terentius Varro was sent,with a command, to receive from him the hostages and convey them toRome. On his arrival, Hostilius immediately ordered one legion, whichwas encamped before the city, to march into it; and having postedguards in suitable places, he summoned the senate into the forum anddemanded hostages of them. On the senate's requesting a delay of twodays to consider the matter, he declared that they must themselvesgive them forthwith, or he would the next day take all the children ofthe senators. After this the military tribunes, the praefects of theallies, and the centurions, were ordered to keep watch at the gates,that no one might go out by night. This duty was not performed withsufficient care and attention, for seven of the principal senators,with their children, escaped before night, and before the guards wereposted at the gates. The next day, as soon as it was light, the senatebegan to be summoned into the forum, when they were missed and theirgoods were sold. From the rest of the senators one hundred and twentyhostages, consisting of their own children, were taken and deliveredover to Caius Terentius to be conveyed to Rome. Before the senate hemade every thing more suspected than before. Considering, therefore,that there was imminent danger of a commotion in Tuscany, they orderedCaius Terentius himself to lead one of the city legions to Arretium,and to employ it for the protection of the city. It was also resolved,that Caius Hostilius, with the other army, should traverse the wholeprovince, and use precautions, that no opportunity might be affordedto those who were desirous of altering the state of things. On hisarrival at Arretium with the legion, Terentius asked the magistratesfor the keys of the gates, when they declared they could not be found;but he, believing that they had been put out of the way with some badintention rather than lost through negligence, took upon himself tohave fresh locks put upon all the gates, and used diligent care tokeep every thing in his own power. He earnestly cautioned Hostiliusto rest his hope in this; that the Tuscans would remain quiet, if heshould take care that not a step could be taken."Book 27,Chapter 25,"The case of the Tarentines was then warmly debated in the senate,Fabius being present, and himself defending those whom he had subduedby force of arms, while others entertained an angry feeling towardsthem; the greater part comparing them with the Campanians in guiltand punishment. A decree of the senate was passed conformably tothe opinion of Manius Acilius, that the town should be guarded bya garrison, and that all the Tarentines should be kept within theirwalls; and further, that the question touching their conduct should behereafter laid before the senate afresh when the state of Italy shouldbe more tranquil. The case of Marcus Livius, praefect of the citadelof Tarentum, was also debated with no less warmth; some proposing avote of censure against the praefect on the ground that Tarentum wasbetrayed to the enemy through his negligence, others proposing rewardsfor having defended the citadel for five years, and because Tarentumhad been recovered chiefly by his single efforts; while some, adoptingan intermediate course, declared that it appertained to the censors,and not to the senate, to take cognizance of his case; and of thislatter opinion was Fabius, who added, however, ""that he admitted thatthe recovery of Tarentum was owing to the efforts of Livius, as hisfriends openly boasted in the senate, but that there would have beenno necessity for its recovery, had it not been lost."" One of theconsuls, Titus Quinctius Crispinus, set out for Lucania, with sometroops to make up the numbers, to take the command of the army whichhad served under Quintus Fulvius Flaccus. Marcellus was detained bya succession of religious scruples, which presented themselves to hismind. One of which was, that when in the Gallic war at Clastidium hehad vowed a temple to Honour and Valour, its dedication was impededby the pontiffs, who said, that one shrine could not with proprietybe dedicated to two deities; because if it should be struck withlightning or any kind of portent should happen in it, the expiationwould be attended with difficulty as it could not be ascertainedto which deity sacrifice ought to be made; nor could one victimbe lawfully offered to two deities, unless in particular cases.Accordingly another temple to Virtue was erected with all speed.Nevertheless, these temples were not dedicated by Marcellus himself.Then at length he set out, with the troops raised to fill up thenumbers, to the army he had left the preceding year at Venusia.Crispinus, who endeavoured to reduce Locri in Bruttium by a siege,because he considered that the affair of Tarentum had added greatly tothe fame of Fabius, had sent for every kind of engine and machine fromSicily; he also sent for ships from the same place to attack that partof the city which lay towards the sea. But this siege was raised byHannibal's bringing his forces to Lacinium, and in consequence of areport, that his colleague, with whom he wished to effect a junction,had now led his army from Venusia. He therefore returned from Bruttiuminto Apulia, and the consuls took up a position in two separate camps,distant from each other less than three miles, between Venusia andBantia. Hannibal, after diverting the war from Locri, returned alsointo the same quarter. Here the consuls, who were both of sanguinetemperament, almost daily went out and drew up their troops foraction, confidently hoping, that if the enemy would hazard anengagement with two consular armies united, they might put an end tothe war."Book 27,Chapter 26,"As Hannibal, who gained one and lost the other of the two battleswhich he fought the preceding year with Marcellus, would have equalgrounds for hope and fear, should he encounter the same generalagain; so was he far from thinking himself a match for the two consulstogether. Directing his attention, therefore, wholly to his ownpeculiar arts, he looked out for an opportunity for planting anambuscade. Slight battles, however, were fought between the two campswith varying success. But the consuls, thinking it probable that thesummer would be spun out in engagements of this kind, and being ofopinion that the siege of Locri might be going on notwithstanding,wrote to Lucius Cincius to pass over to Locri with his fleet fromSicily. And that the walls might be besieged by land also, theyordered one half of the army, which formed the garrison of Tarentum,to be marched thither. Hannibal having found from certain Thuriansthat these things would be done, sent a body of troops to lie inambush on the road leading from Tarentum. There, under the hill ofPetelia, three thousand cavalry and two thousand foot were placed inconcealment. The Romans, who proceeded without exploring their way,having fallen into the ambuscade, as many as two thousand soldierswere slain, and about twelve hundred made prisoners. The others, whowere scattered in flight through the fields and forests, returned toTarentum. There was a rising ground covered with wood situated betweenthe Punic and Roman camps, which was occupied at first by neitherparty, because the Romans were unacquainted with its nature on thatside which faced the enemy's camp, while Hannibal had supposed itbetter adapted for an ambuscade than a camp. Accordingly, he had sentthither, by night, several troops of Numidians, concealing them in themidst of the wood. Not one of them stirred from his position by day,lest their arms or themselves should be observed from a distance.There was a general murmur in the Roman camp, that this eminence oughtto be occupied and secured by a fort, lest if it should be seizedby Hannibal they should have the enemy, as it were, immediately overtheir heads. Marcellus was moved by this consideration, and observedto his colleague, ""Why not go ourselves with a few horsemen andreconnoitre? The matter being examined with our own eyes, will makeour measures more certain."" Crispinus consenting, they set out withtwo hundred and twenty horsemen, of which forty were Fregellans, therest Tuscans. Marcus Marcellus, the consul's son, and Aulus Manlius,military tribunes, together with two prefects of the allies, LuciusArennius and Manius Aulius, accompanied them. Some historians haverecorded, that Marcellus had offered sacrifices on that day, and thatin the first victim slain, the liver was found without its head; inthe second, that all the usual parts were present, and that there wasalso an excrescence in the head. That the aruspex was not, indeed,pleased that the entrails should first have appeared mutilated andfoul, and then too exuberant."Book 27,Chapter 27,"But the consul Marcellus was influenced by so ardent a desireof engaging with Hannibal, that he never thought their camps closeenough. At that time also, as he quitted the rampart, he gave ordersthat the troops should be ready when occasion required, in orderthat if the hill, which they were going to examine, were thoughtconvenient, they might collect their baggage and follow them. Beforethe camp there was a small plain; the road thence to the hill was openand exposed to view on all sides. A watchman who was stationed, notunder the expectation of so important an event, but in order that theymight be able to intercept any stragglers who had gone too far fromthe camp in search of wood or forage, gave a signal to the Numidiansto rise simultaneously one and all from their concealment. Those whowere to rise from the very summit of the hill, and meet the enemy,did not show themselves until those whose business it was to intercepttheir passage in the rear, had gone round. Then they all sprang upfrom every side, and, raising a shout, commenced an attack. Althoughthe consuls were in such a position in the valley that they couldneither make good their way up the hill, which was occupied by theenemy, nor retreat as they were intercepted in the rear, yet thecontest might have been continued longer had not a retreat, commencedby the Tuscans, dismayed the rest of the troops. The Fregellans,however, did not give over fighting, though deserted by the Tuscans,while the consuls, uninjured, kept up the battle by encouragingtheir men and fighting themselves. But when they saw both the consulswounded, and Marcellus transfixed with a lance and falling lifelessfrom his horse, then they too, and but a very few survived, betookthemselves to flight, together with Crispinus the consul, who hadreceived two javelin wounds, and young Marcellus, who was himself alsowounded. Aulus Manlius, a military tribune, was slain, and of the twopraefects of allies, Manius Aulius was slain, Lucius Arennius madeprisoner. Five of the consul's lictors fell into the enemy's handsalive, the rest were either slain or fled with the consul. Forty-threehorsemen fell in the battle or in the flight, and eighteen were takenalive. An alarm had been excited in the camp, and the troops werehastening to go and succour the consuls, when they saw one of theconsuls and the son of the other wounded, and the scanty remainsof this unfortunate expedition returning to the camp. The deathof Marcellus was an event to be deplored, as well from othercircumstances which attended it, as because that in a mannerunbecoming his years, for he was then more than sixty, andinconsistently with the prudence of a veteran general, he had soimprovidently plunged into ruin himself, his colleague, and almost thewhole commonwealth. I should launch out into too many digressionsfor a single event, were I to relate all the various accounts whichauthors give respecting the death of Marcellus. To pass over others,Lucius Caelius gives three narratives ranged under different heads;one as it is handed down by tradition; a second, written in thepanegyric of his son, who was engaged in the affair; a third, whichhe himself vouched for, being the result of his own investigation. Theaccounts, however, though varying in other points, agree for the mostpart in the fact, that he went out of the camp for the purpose ofviewing the ground; and all state that he was cut off by an ambuscade."Book 27,Chapter 28,"Hannibal, concluding that the enemy were greatly dismayed by oneof their consuls being slain and the other wounded, that he mightnot be wanting on any opportunity presenting itself, immediatelytransferred his camp to the eminence on which the battle had beenfought. Here he found the body of Marcellus, and interred it.Crispinus, disheartened by the death of his colleague and his ownwound, set out during the silence of the following night, and encampedupon the nearest mountains he could reach, in a position elevated andsecured on all sides. Here the two generals exerted their sagacity,the one in effecting, the other in guarding against, a deception.Hannibal got possession of the ring of Marcellus, together with hisbody. Crispinus, fearing lest any artifice should be practised by theCarthaginian's employing this signet as the means of deception, hadsent round messengers to the neighbouring states, informing them, that""his colleague had been slain, and that the enemy were in possessionof his seal, and that they must not give credit to any letters writtenin the name of Marcellus."" This message of the consul arrived atSalapia a little before a letter was brought from Hannibal, written inthe name of Marcellus, to the effect, that ""he should come to Salapiaon the night which followed that day; that the soldiers in thegarrison should hold themselves in readiness, in case he might wantto employ them on any service."" The Salapians were aware of the fraud,and concluding that an opportunity for punishing them was sought byHannibal, from resentment, not only on account of their defection,but also because they slew his horsemen, sent his messenger, who was adeserter from the Romans, back again, in order that the soldiers mightdo what was thought necessary, without his being privy to it, and thenplaced the townsmen in parties to keep guard along the walls, and inconvenient parts of the city. The guards and watches they formed withextraordinary care for that night, and on each side of the gate atwhich they supposed the enemy would come, they opposed to them thechoicest of the troops in the garrison. About the fourth watch,Hannibal approached the city. His vanguard was composed of Romandeserters, with Roman arms. These, all of whom spoke the Latinlanguage, when they reached the gate, called up the guards, andordered the gate to be opened, for the consul had arrived. The guards,as if awakened at their call, began to be in a hurry and bustle, andexert themselves in opening the gate, which was closed by letting downthe portcullis; some raised this with levers, others drew it up withropes to such a height that the men could come in without stooping.The opening was scarcely wide enough, when the deserters eagerlyrushed through the gate, and after about six hundred had got in, therope being let go by which it was suspended, the portcullis fell witha loud noise. Some of the Salapians fell upon the deserters, who werecarrying their arms carelessly suspended upon their shoulders, as iscustomary after a march, as if among friends; others frightened awaythe enemy by discharging stones, pikes, and javelins from the toweradjoining the gate and from the walls. Thus Hannibal withdrew, havingbeen caught by his own stratagem, and proceeded to raise the siege ofLocri, which Cincius was carrying on with the greatest vigour, withworks and engines of every kind, which were brought from Sicily. Mago,who by that time almost despaired of retaining and defending thetown, derived his first gleam of hope on the death of Marcellus beingreported. This was followed by a message, that Hannibal had despatchedhis Numidian cavalry in advance, and was himself following them withall possible speed with a body of infantry. As soon, therefore, as hewas informed, by a signal displayed from the watch-towers, thatthe Numidians were drawing near, suddenly throwing open the gate hesallied out boldly upon the enemy, and at first, more because hehad done it unexpectedly than from the equality of his strength, thecontest was doubtful; but afterwards, when the Numidians came up, theRomans were so dismayed that they fled on all hands to the sea andtheir ships, leaving their works and the engines with which theybattered the walls. Thus the siege of Locri was raised by the approachof Hannibal."Book 27,Chapter 29,"When Crispinus found that Hannibal had gone into Bruttium, heordered Marcus Marcellus, a military tribune, to march the army, whichhis colleague had commanded, to Venusia. Having set out himself withhis own legions for Capua, though scarcely able to endure the motionof the litter, from the severity of his wounds, he sent a letter toRome stating the death of his colleague, and in how great danger hehimself was. He said, ""it was impossible for him to go to Rome to holdthe election, both because he did not think he could bear the fatigueof the journey, and because he was anxious about Tarentum, lestHannibal should direct his course thither from Bruttium. That itwas expedient that commissioners should be sent to him, men of soundjudgment, with whom he might communicate, when he pleased, respectingthe commonwealth."" The reading of this letter excited great grief forthe death of one of the consuls, and apprehension for the safety ofthe other. They therefore sent Quintus Fabius the younger to Venusiato the army; and to the consul three commissioners, Sextus JuliusCaesar, Lucius Licinius Pollio, and Lucius Cincius Alimentus, thoughbut a few days before he had returned from Sicily. These were directedto convey a message to the consul, to the effect, that if he could nothimself go to Rome to hold the election, he should nominate a dictatorwithin the Roman territory for that purpose. If the consul should havegone to Tarentum, that it was the pleasure of the senate that MarcusClaudius, the praetor, should march off his legions to that quarterin which he could protect the greatest number of the cities of theallies. The same summer Marcus Valerius crossed over from Sicily intoAfrica with a fleet of a hundred ships, and making a descent near thecity Clupea, devastated the country to a wide extent, scarcely meetingwith a single person in arms. Afterwards the troops employed in makingthese depredations were hastily led back to their ships, and a reporthad suddenly reached them that a Carthaginian fleet was drawing near.It consisted of eighty-three ships. With these the Romans foughtsuccessfully, not far from the city Clupea, and after taking eighteenand putting the rest to flight, returned to Lilybaeum with a greatdeal of booty gained both by land and sea. The same summer also Philipgave assistance to the suppliant Achaeans. They were harassedby Machanidas, tyrant of the Lacedaemonians, with a war in theirimmediate neighbourhood; and the Aetolians, having passed over an armyin ships through the strait which runs between Naupactus and Patrae,called by the neighbouring people Rhion, had devastated their country.It was reported also, that Attalus, king of Asia, would pass over intoEurope, because the Aetolians, in their last council, had offered tohim the office of chief magistrate of their nation."Book 27,Chapter 30,"Philip, when marching down into Greece, for these reasons, was metat the city Lamia by the Aetolians, under the command of Pyrrhias,who had been created praetor that year jointly with Attalus, who wasabsent. They had with them also auxiliaries from Attalus, and about athousand men sent from the Roman fleet by Publius Sulpicius. Againstthis general and these forces, Philip fought twice successfully, andslew full a thousand of his enemies in each battle. Whence, as theAetolians were compelled by fear to keep themselves under the walls ofLamia, Philip led back his army to Phalara. This place is situated inthe Malian bay, and was formerly thickly inhabited on account of itsexcellent harbour, the safe anchorage in its neighbourhood, and otherconveniences of sea and land. Hither came ambassadors from Ptolemy,king of Egypt, the Rhodians, Athenians, and Chians, to put a stopto hostilities between the Aetolians and Philip. The Aetolians alsocalled in one of their neighbours as a mediator, Amynander, king ofthe Athamanians. But all these were less concerned for the Aetolians,whose arrogance of disposition exceeded that of any other nation ofGreece, than lest Philip and his empire, which was likely to proveinjurious to the cause of liberty, should be intermixed with theaffairs of Greece. The deliberations concerning a peace were put off,to a council of the Achaeans, for which a place and certain day werefixed upon; for the mean time a truce of thirty days was obtained. Theking, setting out thence, went through Thessaly and Boeotia to Chalcisin Euboea, to prevent Attalus, who he heard was about to come toEuboea with a fleet, from entering the harbours and approaching thecoasts. Leaving a force to oppose Attalus, in case he should crossover in the mean time, he set out thence with a small body of cavalryand light-armed troops, and came to Argos. Here the superintendenceof the Heraean and Nemaean games having been conferred upon him by thesuffrages of the people, because the kings of the Macedonians tracetheir origin from that state, after completing the Heraean games, heset out directly after the celebration for Aegium, to the councilof allies, fixed some time before. Here measures were proposed forputting an end to the Aetolian war, in order that neither the Romansnor Attalus might have a pretext for entering Greece; but theywere all upset by the Aetolians, before the period of the truce hadscarcely expired, after they heard that Attalus had arrived at Aegina,and that a Roman fleet was stationed at Naupactus. For when calledinto the council of the Achaeans, where the same embassies werepresent which had negotiated for peace at Phalara, they at firstcomplained of some trifling acts committed during the period of thetruce, contrary to the faith of the convention; but at last theyasserted, that it was impossible the war could be terminated unlessthe Achaeans gave back Pylus to the Messenians, unless Atintania wasrestored to the Romans, and Ardyaea to Scerdilaedus and Pleuratus.But Philip, conceiving it an indignity that the vanquished shouldpresumptuously dictate terms to him the victor, said, ""that he did notbefore either listen to proposals for peace, or agree to a truce, fromany hope he entertained that the Aetolians would remain quiet, butin order that he might have all the allies as witnesses that he wasdesirous of peace, and that they were the occasion of this war."" Thus,without effecting a peace, he dismissed the council; and leaving fourthousand troops for the protection of the Achaeans, and receiving fivemen of war, with which, if he could have joined them to the fleet ofthe Carthaginians lately sent to him, and the ships which were comingfrom Bithynia, from king Prusias, he had resolved to challenge theRomans, who had long been masters of the sea in that quarter, to anaval battle, the king himself went back from the congress to Argos;for now the time for celebrating the Nemaean games was approaching,which he wished to be celebrated in his presence."Book 27,Chapter 31,"While the king was occupied with the exhibition of the games, andwas indulging himself during the days devoted to festivity with morefreedom than in time of war, Publius Sulpicius, setting out fromNaupactus, brought his fleet to the shore, between Sicyon and Corinth,and devastated without restraint a country of the most renownedfertility. Intelligence of this proceeding called Philip away from thegames. He set out hastily with his cavalry, ordering his infantry tofollow him closely; and attacking the Romans as they were scatteredthrough the fields and loaded with booty, like men who feared nothingof the kind, drove them to their ships. The Roman fleet returned toNaupactus by no means pleased with their booty. The fame of a victorygained by Philip over the Romans, of whatever magnitude, increasedthe celebrity of the remaining part of the games. The festival wascelebrated with extraordinary mirth, the more so as the king, in orderto please the people, took the diadem off his head, and laid asidehis purple robe with the other royal apparel, and placed himself, withregard to appearance, on an equality with the rest, than which nothingis more gratifying to free states. By this conduct he would haveafforded the strongest hopes of the enjoyment of liberty, had he notdebased and marred all by his intolerable lust; for he rangednight and day through the houses of married people with one or twocompanions, and in proportion as he was less conspicuous by loweringhis dignity to a private level, the less restraint he felt; thusconverting that empty show of liberty, which he had made to others,into a cover for the gratification of his own unbounded desires. Forneither did he obtain his object in all cases by money or seductivearts, but he also employed violence in the accomplishment of hisflagitious purposes; and it was dangerous both to husbands and parentsto have presented any impediment to the gratification of royal lust,by an unseasonable strictness. From one man, Aratus, of the highestrank among the Achaeans, his wife, named Polycratia, was taken awayand conveyed into Macedonia under the hope of a matrimonial connexionwith royalty. After passing the time appointed for the celebrationof the Nemaean games, and a few days more, in the commission of theseprofligate acts, he set out for Dymae to expel the garrison of theAetolians, which had been invited by the Eleans, and received into thetown. Cycliadas, who had the chief direction of affairs, met the kingat Dymae, together with the Achaeans, who were inflamed with hatredagainst the Eleans, because they had disunited themselves from therest of the Achaeans, and were incensed against the Aetolians, becausethey considered that they had stirred up a Roman war against them.Setting out from Dymae, and uniting their forces, they passed theriver Larissus, which separates the Elean from the Dymaean territory."Book 27,Chapter 32,"The first day on which they entered upon the enemy's confines,they employed in plundering. The following day they approached thecity in battle-array, having sent their cavalry in advance, in orderthat, by riding up to the gates, they might provoke the Aetolians tomake a sally, a measure to which they were naturally inclined. Theywere not aware that Sulpicius had passed over from Naupactus toCyllene with fifteen ships, and landing four thousand armed men, hadentered Elis during the dead of night, that his troops might not beseen. Accordingly, when they recognised the Roman standards and armsamong the Aetolians, so unexpected an event occasioned the greatestterror; and at first the king had wished to withdraw his troops; butafterwards, an engagement having taken place between the Aetolians andTrallians, a tribe of Illyrians, when he saw his men hard pressed, theking himself with his cavalry charged a Roman cohort. Here his horsebeing pierced with a javelin threw the king, who fell over his head;when a conflict ensued, which was desperate on both sides; the Romansmaking a furious attack upon the king, and the royal party protectinghim. His own conduct was highly meritorious, when though on foot hewas obliged to fight among horsemen. Afterwards, when the contestwas unequal, many were falling and being wounded around him, he wassnatched away by his soldiers, and, being placed upon another horse,fled from the field. On that day he pitched his camp five miles fromthe city of the Eleans, and the next day led out all his forces to afort called Pyrgus, whither he had heard that a multitude of rusticshad resorted through fear of being plundered. This unorganized andunarmed multitude he took immediately on his approach, from the firsteffects of alarm; and by this capture compensated for the disgracesustained at Elis. While engaged in distributing the spoil andcaptives, and there were four thousand men and as many as twentythousand head of cattle of every kind, intelligence reached himfrom Macedonia that one Eropus had gained possession of Lychnidus bybribing the praefect of the citadel and garrison; that he held alsocertain towns of the Dassaretians, and that he was endeavouringto incite the Dardanians to arms. Desisting from the Achaean war,therefore, but still leaving two thousand five hundred armed troops ofevery description under the generals Menippus and Polyphantas for theprotection of his allies, he set out from Dymae, and passing throughAchaea, Boeotia, and Euboea, arrived on the tenth day at Demetrias inThessaly."Book 27,Chapter 33,"Here he was met by other messengers with intelligence of stillgreater commotions; that the Dardanians, having poured into Macedonia,were in possession of Orestis, and had descended into the Argestaeanplain; and that there was a general report among the barbarians thatPhilip was slain. In that expedition in which he fought with theplundering party near Sicyon, being carried by the fury of his horseagainst a tree, he broke off the extremity of one of the horns of hishelmet against a projecting branch; which being found by a certainAetolian and carried into Aetolia to Scerdilaedus, who knew it tobe the ornament of his helmet, spread the report that the king waskilled. After the king had departed from Achaea, Sulpicius, going toAegina with his fleet, formed a junction with Attalus. The Achaeansfought successfully with the Aetolians and Eleans not far fromMessene. King Attalus and Publius Sulpicius wintered at Aegina. In theclose of this year Titus Quinctius Crispinus, the consul, after havingnominated Titus Manlius Torquatus dictator for the purpose of holdingthe election and celebrating the games, died of his wound. Some saythat he died at Tarentum, others in Campania. The death of the twoconsuls, who were slain without having fought any memorable battle, acoincidence which had never occurred in any former war, had left thecommonwealth in a manner orphan. The dictator, Manlius, appointed ashis master of the horse Caius Servilius, then curule aedile. On thefirst day of its meeting the senate ordered the dictator to celebratethe great games which Marcus Aemilius, the city praetor, hadcelebrated in the consulship of Caius Flaminius and Cneius Servilius,and had vowed to be repeated after five years. The dictator then bothperformed the games and vowed them for the following lustrum. But asthe two consular armies without commanders were so near the enemy,disregarding every thing else, one especial care engrossed the fathersand the people, that of creating the consuls as soon as possible; andthat they might create those in preference whose valour was least indanger from Carthaginian treachery; since, through the whole periodof the war, the precipitate and hot tempers of their generals had beendetrimental, and this very year the consuls had fallen into a snarefor which they were not prepared, in consequence of their excessiveeagerness to engage the enemy, but the immortal gods, in pity to theRoman name, had spared the unoffending armies, and doomed the consulsto expiate their temerity with their own lives."Book 27,Chapter 34,"On the fathers' looking round to see whom they should appoint asconsuls, Caius Claudius Nero appeared pre-eminently. They then lookedout for a colleague for him, and although they considered him a man ofthe highest talents, they also were of opinion that he was of a moreforward and vehement disposition than the circumstances of the war, orthe enemy, Hannibal, required, they resolved that it would be right toqualify the impetuosity of his temper by uniting with him a cool andprudent colleague. The person fixed upon was Marcus Livius, who, manyyears ago, was, on the expiration of his consulship, condemned in atrial before the people; a disgrace which he took so much to heart,that he retired into the country, and for many years absented himselffrom the city, and avoided all public assemblies. Much about theeighth year after his condemnation, Marcus Claudius Marcellus andMarcus Valerius Laevinus, the consuls, had brought him back into thecity; but he appeared in a squalid dress, his hair and beard allowedto grow, and exhibiting in his countenance and attire the deepimpression of the disgrace he had sustained. Lucius Veturius andPublius Licinius, the censors, compelled him to have his beard andhair trimmed, to lay aside his squalid garb, to come into the senate,and discharge other public duties. But even then he either gave hisassent by a single word, or signified his vote by walking to one sideof the house, till the trial of Marcus Livius Macatus, a kinsmanof his, whose character was at stake, obliged him to deliver hissentiments in the senate upon his legs. On being heard in the senateon this occasion, after so long an interval, he drew the eyes of allupon him, and gave occasion to conversations to the following effect:""That the people had injuriously disgraced a man who was undeservingof it and that it had been greatly detrimental to the state that,in so important a war, it had not had the benefit of the serviceand counsels of such a man. That neither Quintus Fabius nor MarcusValerius Laevinus could be given to Caius Nero as colleagues, becauseit was not allowed for two patricians to be elected. That thesame cause precluded Titus Manlius, besides that he had refused aconsulship when offered to him, and would refuse it. That they wouldhave two most distinguished consuls if they should add Marcus Liviusas a colleague to Caius Claudius."" Nor did the people despise aproposal, the mention of which originated with the fathers. The onlyperson in the state who objected to the measure was the man to whomthe honour was offered, who accused his countrymen of inconstancy,saying, ""that, having withheld their pity from him when arrayed in amourning garment and a criminal, they now forced upon him the whitegown against his will; that honours and punishments were heaped uponthe same person. If they esteemed him a good man, why had they thuspassed a sentence of condemnation upon him as a wicked and guilty one?If they had proved him a guilty man, why should they thus trust himwith a second consulate after having improperly committed to him thefirst?"" While thus remonstrating and complaining, the fathers rebukedhim, putting him in mind, that ""Marcus Furius too, being recalled fromexile, had reinstated his country when shaken from her very base.That we ought to soothe the anger of our country as we would that ofparents, by patience and resignation."" All exerting themselves to theutmost, they succeeded in uniting Marcus Livius in the consulate withCaius Claudius."Book 27,Chapter 35,"The third day afterwards the election of praetors was held. Thepraetors created were, Lucius Porcius Licinus, Caius Mamilius, AulusHostilius Cato, and Caius Hostilius Cato. The election completed, andthe games celebrated, the dictator and master of the horse abdicatedtheir offices. Caius Terentius Varro was sent as propraetor intoEtruria, in order that Caius Hostilius might quit that province andgo to Tarentum to that army which Titus Quinctius, the consul, hadcommanded, and that Lucius Manlius might go as ambassador across thesea, and observe what was going on there; and at the same time, asthe games at Olympia, which were attended by the greatest concourseof persons of any solemnity in Greece, were about to take place thatsummer, that if he could without danger from the enemy, he might go tothat assembly, in order that any Sicilians who might be there, havingbeen driven away by the war, or any Tarentine citizens banished byHannibal, might return to their homes, and be informed that the Romanpeople would restore to them every thing which they had possessedbefore the war. As a year of the most dangerous character seemed tothreaten them, and there were no consuls to direct the government, allmen fixed their attention on the consuls elect, wishing them todraw lots for their provinces, as soon as possible, and determinebeforehand what province and what enemy each should have. The senatealso took measures, at the instance of Quintus Fabius Maximus, toeffect a reconciliation between them. For the enmity between them wasnotorious; and in the case of Livius his misfortunes rendered it moreinveterate and acrimonious, as he considered that in that situationhe had been treated with contempt. He was, therefore, the moreinexorable, and said, ""that there was no need of a reconciliation, forthat they would use greater diligence and activity in every thing theydid for fear lest they should give their colleague, who was an enemy,an opportunity of advancing himself at their expense."" However, theauthority of the senate prevailed; and, laying aside their privatedifferences, they conducted the affairs of the state in friendshipand unanimity. Their provinces were not districts bordering uponeach other, as in former years, but quite separate, in the remotestconfines of Italy. To one was decreed Bruttium and Lucania, to actagainst Hannibal; to the other Gaul, to act against Hasdrubal, who, itwas reported, was now approaching the Alps; and that he to whose lotGaul fell should choose whichever he pleased of the two armies, one ofwhich was in Gaul, the other in Etruria, and receive the city legionsin addition; and that he to whose lot Bruttium fell, should, afterenlisting fresh legions for the city, take the army of whicheverof the consuls of the former year he pleased. That Quintus Fulvius,proconsul, should take the army which was left by the consul, and thathis command should last for a year. To Caius Hostilius, to whom theyhad given the province of Tarentum in exchange for Etruria, they gaveCapua instead of Tarentum, with one legion which Fulvius had commandedthe preceding year."Book 27,Chapter 36,"The anxiety respecting the approach of Hasdrubal to Italyincreased daily. At first, ambassadors from the Massilians had broughtword that he had passed over into Gaul and that the expectationsof the Gauls were raised by his coming, as he was reported tohave brought a large quantity of gold for the purpose of hiringauxiliaries. Afterwards, Sextus Antistius and Marcus Raecius, who weresent from Rome, together with these persons, as ambassadors, to lookinto the affair, had brought word back that they had sent personswith Massilian guides, who, through the medium of Gallic chieftainsconnected with them by hospitality, might bring back all ascertainedparticulars; that they found that Hasdrubal, who had already collectedan immense army, would cross the Alps the ensuing spring; and that theonly cause which delayed him there was, that the passage of theAlps was closed by winter. Publius Aelius Paetus was created andinaugurated in the office of augur in the room of Marcus Marcellus andCneius Cornelius Dolabella was inaugurated king of the sacred rites inthe room of Marcus Marcius, who had died two years before. This sameyear, for the first time since Hannibal came into Italy, the lustrumwas closed by the censors Publius Sempronius Tuditanus and MarcusCornelius Cethegus. The citizens numbered in the census were onehundred and thirty-seven thousand one hundred and eight, a numberconsiderably smaller than before the war. This year it is recordedthat the Comitium was covered, and that the Roman games were repeatedonce by the curule aediles, Quintus Metellus and Caius Servilius; andthat the plebeian games were repeated twice by Quintus Mamilius andMarcus Caecilius Metellus, plebeian aediles. The same persons alsogave three statues for the temple of Ceres, and there was a feast inhonour of Jupiter on occasion of the games. After this Caius ClaudiusNero and Marcus Livius a second time entered upon their consulate;and as they had already, while consuls elect, drawn lots for theirprovinces, they ordered the praetors to draw lots for theirs. CaiusHostilius had the city jurisdiction, to which the foreign was added,in order that three praetors might go out to the provinces. AulusHostilius had Sardinia, Caius Mamilius, Sicily, Lucius Porcius,Gaul. The total amount of legions employed in the provinces wastwenty-three, which were so distributed that the consuls might havetwo each; Spain, four; the three praetors in Sicily, Sardinia, andGaul, two each; Caius Terentius, two in Etruria; Quintus Fulvius, twoin Bruttium; Quintus Claudius two in the neighbourhood of Tarentum andthe territory of Sallentum; Caius Hostilius Tubulus, one at Capua;and two were ordered to be enlisted for the city. For the first fourlegions the people elected tribunes, the consuls sent those for therest."Book 27,Chapter 37,"Before the consuls set out, the nine days' sacred rite wasperformed, as a shower of stones had fallen from the sky at Veii.After the mention of one prodigy, others also were reported, as usual.At Minturnae, that the temple of Jupiter and the grove of Marica, andat Atella also that a wall and gate, had been struck by lightning.The people of Minturnae added what was more alarming, that a stream ofblood had flowed at their gate. At Capua, a wolf, which had entered atthe gate by night, had torn a watchman. These prodigies were expiatedwith victims of the larger kind, and a supplication for one day wasmade, according to a decree of the pontiffs. The nine days' sacredrite was then performed again, because a shower of stones had beenseen to fall in the armilustrum. After the people's minds hadbeen freed from superstitious fears, they were again disturbed byintelligence that an infant had been born at Frusino as large as achild of four years old, and not so much an object of wonder fromits size, as that it was born without any certain mark of distinctionwhether it was male or female, which was the case two years beforeat Sinuessa. Aruspices, called in from Etruria, declared this to beindeed a foul and ill-omened prodigy, which ought to be removed out ofthe Roman territory, and, being kept far from coming in contact withthe earth, to be plunged into the deep. They shut it up alive in achest, and carrying it away, threw it into the sea. The pontiffs alsodecreed, that thrice nine virgins should go through the city singinga hymn. While in the temple of Jupiter Stator they were learningthis hymn, which was composed by the poet Livius, the temple of JunoRegina, on the Aventine, was struck by lightning; and the aruspices,on being consulted, having replied that that prodigy appertained tothe matrons, and that the goddess must be appeased by a present, suchof the matrons as dwelt within the city and within the tenth milestonefrom it, were summoned to the Capitol by an edict of the curuleaediles; when they themselves chose twenty-five out of their own body,to whom they paid a contribution out of their dowries, from whicha golden basin was made, as a present, and carried to the Aventine,where a sacrifice was performed by the matrons in a pure and chastemanner. Immediately a day was given out by the decemviri for anothersacrifice to the same goddess, which was performed in the followingorder: two white heifers were led from the temple of Apollo into thecity through the Carmental gate; after these, two cypress images ofJuno Regina were carried; after these went seven and twenty virgins,arrayed in white vestments, and singing in honour of Juno Regina ahymn, which to the uncultivated minds of that time might appear tohave merit, but if repeated now would seem inelegant and uncouth. Thetrain of virgins was followed by the decemvirs, crowned with laurel,and in purple-bordered robes. From the gate they proceeded by theJugarian street into the forum: in the forum the procession stopped,and the virgins, linked together by a cord passed through their hands,moved on, beating time with their feet to the music of their voices.They then proceeded by the Tuscan street and the Velabrum, throughthe cattle market, up the Publician hill, and to the temple of JunoRegina; where two victims were immolated by the decemviri, and thecypress images carried into the temple."Book 27,Chapter 38,"After the deities were appeased in due form, the consuls made thelevy with greater diligence and strictness than any one rememberedit to have been made in former years; for the war was now doublyformidable, in consequence of the advance of a new enemy into Italy,while the number of the youth from which they could enlist soldierswas diminished. They therefore resolved to compel the settlers uponthe sea-coast, who were said to possess an exemption from servicesolemnly granted, to furnish soldiers; and on their refusing to doso, appointed that they should severally lay before the senate, ona certain day, the grounds on which they claimed exemption. On theappointed day the following people came to the senate: the peopleof Ostia, Alsia, Antium, Anxur, Minturnae, and Sinuessa, and, onthe upper sea, Sena. After each people had stated their grounds ofexemption, the exemption of none was allowed, as the enemy was inItaly, except those of Antium and Ostia, and of these colonies theyoung men were bound by oath that they would not lodge without thewalls of their colony, while the enemy was in Italy, more than thirtydays. Although it was the opinion of all that the consuls ought toproceed to the war as soon as possible, (for Hasdrubal ought to be meton his descent from the Alps, lest he might seduce the Cisalpine Gaulsand Etruria, which was anxiously looking forward to a revolution;while it was necessary to occupy Hannibal with a war in his ownquarters, lest he should emerge from Bruttium, and advance to meet hisbrother;) yet Livius delayed, not having sufficient confidence inthe armies destined for his provinces. He said his colleague had hisoption to take which he pleased out of two excellent consular armies,and a third which Quintus Claudius commanded at Tarentum. He alsomade mention of recalling the volunteer slaves to their standards.The senate gave the consuls unrestricted liberty of filling up theirnumbers from what source they pleased, of selecting out of all thearmies such as they liked, and of exchanging and removing from oneprovince to another, as they thought conducive to the good of thestate. In all these affairs the consuls acted with the most perfectharmony. The volunteer slaves were enlisted into the nineteenth andtwentieth legions. Some authors state that very efficient auxiliarieswere sent out of Spain also to Marcus Livius by Publius Scipio;namely, eight thousand Spaniards and Gauls, two thousand legionarysoldiers, a thousand horse of Numidians and Spaniards together.That Marcus Lucretius brought these forces in ships, and that CaiusMamilius sent as many as four thousand bowmen and slingers out ofSicily."Book 27,Chapter 39,"A letter which was brought out of Gaul from Lucius Porcius, thepraetor, increased the alarm at Rome. It stated that Hasdrubal hadquitted his winter quarters, and was now crossing the Alps; that eightthousand Ligurians had been enlisted and armed, which would join himwhen he had crossed over into Italy, unless some general were sentinto Liguria to engage them with a war. That he would himself advanceas far as he thought it safe with his small forces. This letterobliged the consuls hastily to conclude the levy, and go earlier thanthey had determined into their provinces, with the intention that eachshould keep his enemy in his own province, and not allow them to forma junction or concentrate their forces. This object was much aided byan opinion possessed by Hannibal; for although he felt assured thathis brother would cross over into Italy that summer, yet when herecollected what difficulties he had himself experienced through aperiod of five months, first in crossing the Rhone, then the Alps,contending against men, and the nature of the ground, he was far fromexpecting that his transit would be so easy and expeditious, and thiswas the cause of his moving more slowly from his winter quarters. Butall things were done by Hasdrubal with less delay and trouble than hehimself or any others expected. For the Arverni, and after them theother Gallic and Alpine nations in succession, not only gave him afriendly reception, but followed him to the war; and not only hadroads been formed during the passage of his brother in most of thecountries through which he marched, and which were before impassable,but also as the Alps had been passable for a period of twelve years,he marched through tribes of less ferocious dispositions. Forbefore that time, being never visited by foreigners, nor accustomed,themselves, to see a stranger in their country, they were unsociableto the whole human race. And at first, not knowing whither theCarthaginian was going, they had imagined that their own rocks andforts, and the plunder of their cattle and people, were his objects;but afterwards, the report of the Punic war with which Italy was beingdesolated for now ten years, had convinced them that the Alps wereonly a passage, and that two very powerful nations, separated fromeach other by a vast tract of sea and land, were contending for empireand power. These were the causes which opened the Alps to Hasdrubal.But the advantage which he gained by the celerity of his march helost by his delay at Placentia, while he carried on a fruitless siege,rather than an assault. He had supposed that it would be easy to takeby storm a town situated on a plain; and the celebrity of the colonyinduced him to believe that by destroying it he should strike greatterror into the rest. This siege not only impeded his own progress,but had the effect of restraining Hannibal, who was just on the pointof quitting his winter quarters, after hearing of his passage, whichwas so much quicker than he expected; for he not only revolved in hismind how tedious was the siege of towns, but also how ineffectual washis attempt upon that same colony, when returning victorious from theTrebia."Book 27,Chapter 40,"The consuls, on departing from the city in different directions,had drawn the attention of the public, as it were, to two wars atonce, while they called to mind the disasters which Hannibal's firstcoming had brought upon Italy, and at the same time, tortured withanxiety, asked themselves what deities would be so propitious to thecity and empire as that the commonwealth should be victorious in bothquarters at once. Hitherto they had been enabled to hold out to thepresent time by compensating for their misfortunes by their successes.When the Roman power was laid prostrate at the Trasimenus and atCannae in Italy, their successes in Spain had raised it up from itsfallen condition. Afterwards, when in Spain one disaster after anotherhad in a great measure destroyed two armies, with the loss of twodistinguished generals, the many successes in Italy and Sicily had,as it were, afforded a haven for the shattered state; and the mereinterval of space, as one war was going on in the remotest quarterof the world, gave them time to recover their breath. Whereas now twowars were received into Italy; two generals of the highest renown werebesetting the Roman city; while the whole weight of the danger andthe entire burden pressed upon one point. Whichever of these generalsshould be first victorious, he would in a few days unite his campwith the other. The preceding year also, saddened by the deaths of twoconsuls, filled them with alarm. Such were the anxious feelings withwhich the people escorted the consuls on their departure to theirprovinces. It is recorded that Marcus Livius, still teeming withresentment against his countrymen, when setting out to the war,replied to Fabius, who warned him not rashly to come to an action tillhe had made himself acquainted with the character of his enemy, thatas soon as ever he had got sight of the troops of the enemy he wouldengage them. When asked what was his reason for such haste, he said,""I shall either obtain the highest glory from conquering the enemy,or the greatest joy from the defeat of my countrymen, a joy whichthey have deserved, though it would not become me."" Before the consulClaudius arrived in his province, Caius Hostilius Tubulus, attackingHannibal with his light cohorts while marching his army through theextreme borders of the territory of Larinum into that of Sallentum,caused terrible confusion in his unmarshalled troops; he killed asmany as four thousand, and captured nine military standards. QuintusClaudius, who had his camps distributed through the towns of theSallentine territory, had quitted his winter quarters on hearing ofthe enemy; and Hannibal, fearing on that account lest he should haveto engage with two armies at once, decamped by night, and retired fromthe Tarentine to the Bruttian territory. Claudius turned his armyto the Sallentine territory. Hostilius, on his way to Capua, metthe consul Claudius at Venusia. Here forty thousand infantry and twothousand five hundred horse were selected from both armies, with whichthe consul might carry on the war against Hannibal. The rest of thetroops Hostilius was directed to march to Capua to deliver them overto Quintus Fulvius, proconsul."Book 27,Chapter 41,"Hannibal, having drawn together his forces from all quarters, boththose which he had in winter quarters, and those which he had in thegarrisons of the Bruttian territory, came to Grumentum in Lucania,with the hope of regaining the towns which through fear had revoltedto the Romans. To the same place the Roman consul proceeded fromVenusia, exploring the way as he went, and pitched his camp aboutfifteen hundred paces from the enemy. The rampart of the Carthaginiansseemed almost united with the walls of Grumentum, though five hundredpaces intervened. Between the Carthaginian and Roman camps lay aplain; and overhanging the left wing of the Carthaginians and theright of the Romans were some naked hills, which were not objectsof suspicion to either party, as they had no wood upon them, nor anyhiding-places for an ambuscade. In the plain which lay between themskirmishes hardly worth mentioning took place between parties sallyingfrom the outposts. It was evident that what the Roman aimed at was toprevent the enemy from going off, while Hannibal, who was desirous ofescaping thence, came down with all his forces, and formed in orderof battle. Upon this the consul, imitating the crafty character of hisenemy, ordered five cohorts, with the addition of five maniples, topass the summit by night and sit down in the valleys on the oppositeside; a measure to which he was prompted the more strongly inproportion as he felt that there could exist no suspicion of anambuscade in hills so uncovered. Of the time for rising up from theirretreat and of falling upon the enemy he informed Tiberius ClaudiusAsellus, a military tribune, and Publius Claudius, praefect of theallies, whom he sent with them. The general himself, at break of day,drew out all his forces, both foot and horse, for battle. Shortlyafter, the signal for battle was given out by Hannibal, and a noisewas raised in the camp, from the troops running hastily to arms; thenboth horse and foot eagerly rushed through the gates, and spreadingthemselves over the plain, hastened to the enemy. The consulperceiving them thus disordered, gave orders to Caius Aurunculeius, amilitary tribune of the third legion, to send out the cavalry of thelegion to charge the enemy with all possible vehemence, for that theenemy had spread themselves like cattle in such disorder throughoutthe whole plain, that they might be knocked down and trampled underfoot before they could be formed."Book 27,Chapter 42,"Hannibal had not yet gone out of the camp, when he heard the shoutof his troops engaged; and thus roused by the alarm, he hastily ledhis forces against the enemy. Already had the Roman horse spreadterror through the Carthaginian van; the first legion also of theinfantry and the right wing were commencing the action, while thetroops of the Carthaginians, in disorder, engaged just as chance threweach in the way of horse or foot. The battle became more general byreinforcements, and the number of those who ran out to the combat.Hannibal, amid the terror and confusion, would have drawn up histroops while fighting, (which would not have been an easy task unlessto a veteran general with veteran soldiers,) had not the shouts of thecohorts and maniples, running down from the hills, which was heard intheir rear, created an alarm lest they should be cut off from theircamp. After this they were seized with a panic, and a flight commencedin every part; but the number slain was less, because the nearness ofthe camp offered to the terrified troops a shorter distance to fly.For the cavalry hung upon their rear, and the cohorts, running downthe declivities of the hills by an unobstructed and easy path, chargedthem transversely in flank. However, above eight thousand menwere slain, above seven hundred made prisoners, and eight militarystandards taken. Of the elephants also, which had been of no use insuch a sudden and irregular action, four were killed and two captured.The conquerors lost about five hundred Romans and allies. Thefollowing day the Carthaginian remained quiet. The Roman having ledout his troops into the field, when he saw that no one came out tomeet him, gave orders that the spoils of those of the enemy who wereslain should be collected, and that the bodies of his own men shouldbe gathered into one place and buried. After this, for several daysfollowing in succession, he came up so near the enemy's gates that healmost seemed to be carrying in his standards. But at length Hannibalat the third watch, leaving a number of fires and tents in that partof the camp which faced the enemy, and also a few Numidians who mightshow themselves in the rampart and the gates, decamped and proceededtowards Apulia. As soon as it dawned, the Roman army came up to thetrenches, and the Numidians, according to the plan concerted, tookcare to show themselves for a little time on the rampart and in thegates; and having deceived the enemy for some time, rode off at fullspeed, and overtook their friends on their march. The consul, when allwas silence in the camp, and he could now no where see even the fewwho at break of day had walked up and down, sent two horsemen inadvance to reconnoitre; and after he had ascertained that all was safeenough, ordered his troops to march in; and after staying there onlywhile his men distributed themselves for plunder, sounded a retreatand led back his forces long before night. The next day he set out assoon as it was light, and following the rumour and the track of theenemy by forced marches, came up with them not far from Venusia. Herealso an irregular battle took place, in which two thousand of theCarthaginians were slain. The Carthaginian quitting this place madefor Metapontum, marching by night and over mountainous districts inorder to avoid a battle. Thence Hanno, who commanded the garrison ofthat place, was sent into Bruttium with a small party to raise afresh army. Hannibal, after adding his forces to his own, went backto Venusia by the same route by which he came, and proceeded thenceto Canusium. Nero had never quitted the enemy's steps, and when hehimself went to Metapontum, had sent for Quintus Fulvius into Lucania,lest that region should be left without protection."Book 27,Chapter 43,"Meanwhile four Gallic horsemen and two Numidians, who were sent toHannibal with a letter from Hasdrubal, after he had retired from thesiege of Placentia, having traversed nearly the whole length of Italythrough the midst of enemies, while following Hannibal as he wasretiring to Metapontum, were taken to Tarentum by mistaking the roads;where they were seized by some Roman foragers, who were stragglingthrough the fields, and brought before the proprietor, Caius Claudius.At first they endeavoured to baffle him by evasive answers, butthreats of applying torture being held out to them, they werecompelled to confess the truth; when they fully admitted that theywere the bearers of a letter from Hasdrubal to Hannibal. They weredelivered into the custody of Lucius Virginius, a military tribune,together with the letter sealed as it was, to be conveyed to theconsul Claudius. At the same time two troops of Samnites were sentwith them as an escort. Having made their way to the consul, theletter was read by means of an interpreter, and the captives wereinterrogated; when Claudius, coming to the conclusion that thepredicament of the state was not such as that her generals shouldcarry on the war, each within the limits of his own province, and withhis own troops, according to the customary plans of warfare, and withan enemy marked out for him by the senate, but that some unlookedfor and unexpected enterprise must be attempted, which, in itscommencement, might cause no less dread among their countrymen thantheir enemies, but which, when accomplished, might convert theirgreat fear into great joy, sent the letter of Hasdrubal to Rome to thesenate; and at the same time informed the conscript fathers what hisintentions were; and recommended that, as Hasdrubal had written to hisbrother that he should meet him in Umbria, they should send for thelegion from Capua to Rome, enlist troops at Rome, and oppose the cityforces to the enemy at Narnia. Such was his letter to the senate.Messengers were sent in advance through the territory of Larinum,Marrucia, Frentana, and Praetutia, where he was about to march hisarmy, with orders that they should all bring down from their farms andtowns to the road-side provisions ready dressed for the soldiers toeat; and that they should bring out horses and other beasts of burden,so that those who were tired might have plenty of conveyances. He thenselected the choicest troops out of the whole army of the Romans andallies, to the amount of six thousand infantry and one thousand horse;and gave out that he intended to seize on the nearest town in Lucaniaand the Carthaginian garrison in it, and that they should all bein readiness to march. Setting out by night he turned off towardsPicenum, and making his marches as long as possible, led his troops tojoin his colleague, having left Quintus Catius, lieutenant-general, incommand of the camp."Book 27,Chapter 44,"At Rome the alarm and consternation were not less than they hadbeen two years before, when the Carthaginian camp was pitched overagainst the Roman walls and gates; nor could people make up theirminds whether they should commend, or censure, this so bold march ofthe consul. It was evident that the light in which it would be viewedwould depend upon its success; than which nothing can be more unfair.They said, ""that the camp was left near to the enemy, Hannibal,without a general, and with an army from which all the flower andvigour had been withdrawn; and that the consul had pretended anexpedition into Lucania, when he was in reality going to Picenum andGaul, leaving his camp secured only by the ignorance of the enemy, whowere not aware that the general and part of his army were away. Whatwould be the consequence if that should be discovered, and Hannibalshould think proper either to pursue Nero with his whole army, whohad gone off with only six thousand armed men, or to assault the camp,which was left as a prey for him, without strength, without command,without auspices?"" The disasters already experienced in the war,the deaths of two consuls the preceding year, augmented their fears.Besides, all these events had occurred ""when there was only onegeneral and one army of the enemy in Italy; whereas now they hadtwo Punic wars, two immense armies, and in a manner two Hannibalsin Italy, inasmuch as Hasdrubal was descended from the same father,Hamilcar, was a general equally enterprising, having been trained ina Roman war during so many years in Spain, and rendered famous by adouble victory, having annihilated two armies with two most renownedgenerals. For he could glory even more than Hannibal himself, onaccount of the celerity with which he had effected his passage outof Spain, and his success in stirring up the Gallic nations to arms,inasmuch as he had collected an army in those very regions in whichHannibal lost the major part of his soldiers by famine and cold, themost miserable modes of death."" Those who were experienced in theevents which had occurred in Spain, added, that ""he would not have toengage with Caius Nero, the general, as an unknown person, whom, whenaccidentally caught in a difficult defile, he had eluded and baffledlike a little child, by drawing up fallacious terms of peace."" Underthe dictation of fear, which always puts the worst construction uponthings, they magnified all the advantages which the enemy possessed,and undervalued their own."Book 27,Chapter 45,"When Nero had got such a distance from the enemy that his planmight be disclosed without danger, he briefly addressed his soldiers,observing, that ""there never was a measure adopted by any generalwhich was in appearance more daring than this, but in reality moresafe. That he was leading them on to certain victory. For as hiscolleague had not set out to prosecute the war which he conducted,until forces both of horse and foot had been assigned to him by thesenate to his own satisfaction, and those greater and better equippedthan if he had been going against Hannibal himself, that they would,by joining him, however small the quantity of force which they mightadd, completely turn the scale. That when it was only heard in thefield of battle (and he would take care that it should not be heardbefore) that another consul and another army had arrived, it wouldinsure the victory. That rumour decided war; and that the mostinconsiderable incidents had power to excite hope and fear in themind. That they would themselves reap almost the entire glory whichwould be obtained if they succeeded, for it was invariably the casethat the last addition which is made is supposed to have effected thewhole. That they themselves saw with what multitudes, what admiration,and what good wishes of men their march was attended."" And, byHercules, they marched amid vows, prayers, and commendations, all theroads being lined with ranks of men and women, who had flocked therefrom all parts of the country. They called them the safeguards of thestate, the protectors of the city and empire of Rome. They said thatthe safety and liberty of themselves and their children were treasuredup in their arms and right hands. They prayed to all the gods andgoddesses to grant them a prosperous march, a successful battle, and aspeedy victory over their enemies; and that they might be bound topay the vows which they had undertaken in their behalf; so that asnow they attended them off with anxiety, go after a few days' intervalthey might joyfully go out to meet them exulting in victory. Thenthey severally and earnestly invited them to accept, offered them,and wearied them with entreaties, to take from them in preference toanother, whatever might be requisite for themselves or their cattle.They generously gave them every thing in abundance, while the soldiersvied with each other in moderation, taking care not to accept anything beyond what was necessary for use. They did not make any delaynor quit their ranks when taking food; they continued the march dayand night, scarcely giving as much to rest as was necessary to therequirements of the body. Messengers were also despatched in advanceto his colleague, to inform him of his approach, and to ask whetherhe wished that he should come secretly or openly, by day or night,whether they should lodge in the same or different camps. It appearedmost advisable that they should come into the camp secretly by night."Book 27,Chapter 46,"A private signal was sent through the camp by the consulLivius, that each tribune should receive a tribune, each centurion acenturion, each horseman a horseman, each foot-soldier a foot-soldier;for it was not expedient that the camp should be enlarged, lest theenemy should discover the arrival of the other consul, while thecrowding together of several persons, who would have their tents in aconfined place, would be attended with less inconvenience, because thearmy of Claudius had brought with them on their expedition scarcelyany thing except their arms. Claudius, on the very march, hadaugmented his numbers by volunteers; for not only veteran soldiers,who had completed their period of service, but young men also offeredthemselves without solicitation; and, as they vied with each other ingiving in their names, he had enlisted those whose personal appearanceand bodily strength seemed fit for military service. The camp of theother consul was near Sena, and Hasdrubal's position was about fivehundred paces from it. Nero, therefore, when he was now drawing near,halted under cover of the mountains, in order that he might not enterthe camp before night. Having entered when all was still, theywere severally conducted into their tents by the men of their owndescription, where they were hospitably entertained with the utmostjoy on the part of all. The next day a council was held, at whichLucius Porcius Licinus, the praetor, was present. He had his campjoined to that of the consuls, and before their arrival, by leadinghis army along the heights, sometimes occupying narrow defiles that hemight intercept his passage, at other times harassing his troops whilemarching by attacking their flank or rear, he had baffled the enemy byall the arts of war. This man was, on the present occasion, one ofthe council. Many inclined to the opinion that an engagement shouldbe deferred till Nero had recruited his soldiers, who were weary withmarching and watching, and had employed a few days in acquiring aknowledge of his enemy. Nero urged, not only by persuasion, but withthe most earnest entreaties, ""that they would not render rash by delaythat measure of his which despatch had made safe. That Hannibal, wholay in a state of torpid inactivity in consequence of a delusion whichwould not continue long, had neither attacked his camp, left as it waswithout a leader, nor had directed his course in pursuit of him. Thatthe army of Hasdrubal might be annihilated, and he might retire intoApulia before he stirred a step. The man who by delay gave time to theenemy both betrayed the camp to Hannibal, and opened a way to himinto Gaul, so that he might effect a junction with Hasdrubal at hisleisure, and when he pleased. That they ought to give the signal forbattle instantly, and march out into the field, and take advantage ofthe delusion of their enemies present and absent, while neither thosewere aware that they had fewer, nor these that they had more andstronger forces to encounter."" On the breaking up of the council thesignal for battle was displayed, and the troops immediately led intothe field."Book 27,Chapter 47,"The Carthaginians were already standing before their camp inbattle-array. This circumstance delayed the battle: Hasdrubal, whohad advanced before the line with a few horsemen, remarked some oldshields among the enemy, which he had not seen before, and some horsesleaner than the rest their numbers also appeared greater than usual.Suspecting therefore, what was really the case, he hastily soundeda retreat, and sent a party to the river from which they got theirwater, where some of them might be intercepted, and notice takenwhether there were perchance any there whose complexions were morethan ordinarily sun-burnt, as from a recent march. At the same time heordered a party to ride round the camp at a distance, and note whetherthe rampart was extended in any part, and also observe whether thesignal sounded once or twice. Having received a report of all theseparticulars, the fact of the camp's not being enlarged led him intoerror. There were now two camps, as there were before the other consularrived, one belonging to Marcus Livius, the other to Lucius Porcius,and to neither of them had any addition been made to give more roomfor the tents. But the veteran general, who was accustomed to a Romanenemy, was much struck by their reporting that the signal sounded oncein the praetor's camp, and twice in the consul's; there must thereforebe two consuls, and felt the most painful anxiety as to the mannerin which the other had got away from Hannibal. Least of all could hesuspect, what was really the case, that he had got away from Hannibalby deceiving him to such an extent, as that he knew not where thegeneral was, and where the army whose camp stood opposite to his own.Surely, he concluded, deterred by a defeat of no ordinary kind, he hasnot dared to pursue him; and he began to entertain the most seriousfears that he had himself come too late with assistance, now thataffairs were desperate, and lest the same good fortune attended theRoman arms in Italy which they had experienced in Spain. Sometimeshe imagined that his letter could not have reached him, and that, ithaving been intercepted, the consul had hastened to overpower him.Thus anxious and perplexed, having put out the fires, he issued asignal at the first watch to collect the baggage in silence, and gaveorders to march. In the hurry and confusion occasioned by a marchby night, their guides were not watched with sufficient care andattention. One of them stopped in a place of concealment which he hadbeforehand fixed upon in his mind, the other swam across the riverMetaurus, at a ford with which he was acquainted. The troops, thusdeserted by their guides, at first wandered up and down through thefields; and some of them, overpowered with sleep, and fatigued with,watching, stretched themselves on the ground here and there, leavingtheir standards thinly attended. Hasdrubal gave orders to march alongthe bank of the river until the light should discover the road; but,pursuing a circuitous and uncertain course along the turnings andwindings of that tortuous river, with the intention of crossing itas soon as the first light should discover a place convenient forthe purpose he made but little progress; but wasting the day in afruitless attempt to discover a ford, for the further he went from thesea the higher he found the banks which kept the river in its course,he gave the enemy time to overtake him."Book 27,Chapter 48,"First Nero arrived with the whole body of his cavalry, thenPorcius came up with him, with the light infantry. And while thesewere harassing his weary troops on every side, and charging them, andthe Carthaginian, stopping his march, which resembled a flight, wasdesirous of encamping on an eminence, on the bank of the river, Liviuscame up with all his foot forces, not after the manner of troops onmarch, but armed and marshalled for immediate action. When they hadunited all their forces, and the line was drawn out, Claudius tookthe direction of the battle in the right wing, Livius in the left; themanagement of the centre was given to the praetor. Hasdrubal, when hesaw that an engagement was inevitable, giving over the fortificationof a camp, placed his elephants in the front line, before thestandards; on either side these he placed in the left wing the Gaulsto oppose Claudius, not so much from any confidence he reposed inthem, as because he believed them to be dreaded by the enemy; theright wing he took to himself against M. Livius, together with theSpaniards, in whom, as being veteran troops, he placed his greatesthopes. Behind the elephants, in the centre, the Ligurians were posted;but his line was rather long than deep. The Gauls were covered bya hill, which extended in front. That part of the line which wasoccupied by the Spaniards, engaged the left wing of the Romans, thewhole of whose right wing, extending beyond the line of battle, wasunengaged. The hill before them prevented their making an attackeither in front or flank. Between Livius and Hasdrubal a furiouscontest arose, and the slaughter on both sides was dreadful. Here wereboth generals, here the major part of the Roman horse and infantry,here the Spaniards, veteran troops, and experienced in the Romanmanner of fighting, and the Ligurians, a nation inured to war. Theelephants were also driven to the same place which, on the firstonset, disordered the van, and had made even dislodged the standards;but afterwards, the contest growing hotter, and the shout increasing,they became less submissive to their riders, and ranged to and frobetween the two lines, as if not knowing to which side they belonged,like ships floating about without rudders. Claudius, when he hadstriven in vain to advance up the hill, repeatedly calling out to hissoldiers, ""To what purpose then have we performed so long a march withsuch expedition?"" when he found it impossible to make his way to theenemy in that quarter, withdrawing several cohorts from the rightwing, where he saw they would occupy an inactive station, rather thanjoin in the fight, led them round the rear of the line, and, to thesurprise not only of the enemy but his own party, charged their rightflank; and such was their rapidity, that after showing themselves ontheir flank, they almost immediately made an attack on their rear.Thus on all sides, in front, flank, and rear, the Spaniards andLigurians were cut to pieces; and now the carnage had even reached theGauls. Here the least opposition was found; for a great number of themhad quitted their standards, having slunk off during the night, andlaid themselves down to sleep up and down the fields, while even thosewho were present, being tired with marching and watching, for theirbodies are most intolerant of fatigue, could scarcely carry their armsupon their shoulders. And now it was mid-day, and thirst and heat gavethem over to the enemy to be killed or captured in multitudes."Book 27,Chapter 49," More elephants were killed by their guides than by the enemy. Theyused to have with them a workman's knife, with a mallet. When thesebeasts began to grow furious, and attack their own party, the rider,placing this knife between the ears, just on the joint by which theneck is connected with the head, used to drive it in, striking it withall the force he could. This was found to be the most expeditious modeof putting these bulky animals to death, when they had destroyed allhope of governing them. This method was first practised by Hasdrubal,a general whose conduct both frequently on other occasions, andespecially in this battle, deserved to be recorded. By encouraging themen when fighting, and sharing equally in every danger, he kept upthe battle. Sometimes by entreating, at other times by rebuking,the troops, when tired and indisposed to fight from weariness andover-exertion, he rekindled their spirits. He called back the flying,and restored the battle in many places when it had been given up. Atlength, when fortune decidedly declared for the Romans, lest he shouldsurvive so great an army which had been collected under the influenceof his name, he put spurs to his horse and rushed upon a Roman cohort,where he fell fighting, as was worthy of the son of Hamilcar and thebrother of Hannibal. At no time during that war were so many of theenemy slain in one battle; so that a defeat equal to that sustained atCannae, whether in respect of the loss of the general or the troops,was considered to have been retorted upon him. Fifty-six thousand ofthe enemy were slain, five thousand four hundred captured. The otherbooty was great, both of every other kind, and also of gold andsilver. In addition to the rest, there were recovered above fourthousand Roman citizens, who had been taken by the enemy, which formedsome consolation for the soldiers lost in that battle. For the victorywas by no means bloodless. Much about eight thousand of the Romansand the allies were slain; and so completely were even the victorssatiated with blood and slaughter, that the next day, when Livius theconsul received intelligence that the Cisalpine Gauls and Ligurians,who had either not been present at the battle or had made their escapefrom the carnage, were marching off in one body without a certainleader, without standards, without any discipline or subordination;that if one squadron of horse were sent against them they might beall destroyed, he replied, ""Let some survive to bear the news of theenemy's losses and of our valour."""Book 27,Chapter 50,"Nero set out on the night following the battle, and marching ata more rapid rate than when he came, arrived at his camp before theenemy on the sixth day. As he was not preceded by a messenger, fewerpeople attended him on the march; but the joy felt was so great, thatthey were almost insane with delight. Neither state of feeling at Romecan be well described or told, whether that in which the citizens werewhen in doubtful expectation of the issue, or when they received theintelligence of victory. Every day, from the time that news arrivedthat the consul Claudius had set out, from sun-rise to sun-set, noneof the senators ever quitted the senate-house, or did the peopledepart from the forum. The matrons, as they had themselves no meansof affording assistance, had recourse to prayers and entreaties,and going about to all the temples, wearied the gods with vows andsupplications. While the city was in this state of solicitude andsuspense, a vague report first arrived that two Narnian horsemen hadcome from the field of battle into the camp which stood as a defencein the entrance to Umbria, with intelligence that the enemy were cutto pieces. At first they rather heard than credited this news, asbeing too great and too joyful for the mind to take in, or obtain afirm belief. Even the very rapidity with which it had arrived formedan obstacle to its reception; for it was stated that the battle tookplace two days before. After this a letter was brought which had beensent by Lucius Manlius Acidinus, from his camp, on the subject of thearrival of the Narnian horsemen. This letter being conveyed throughthe forum to the tribunal of the praetor, drew the senators out of thesenate-house; and with such eagerness and hurry did the peoplecrowd to the doors of the senate-house, that the messenger could notapproach, but was dragged off by persons who asked him questions, anddemanded vociferously that the letter should be read on the rostrumbefore it was read in the senate. At length they were put backand restrained by the magistrates; and thus the joy was graduallydispensed to their overpowered spirits. The letter was read first inthe senate, and then in the assembly of the people. The effect wasvarious, according to the difference in the cast of men's minds, somethinking that there were already sure grounds for rejoicing, whileothers would place no confidence in the news, till they listened toambassadors, or a letter from the consuls."Book 27,Chapter 51,"After this, news came that the ambassadors themselves were on thepoint of arriving. Then, indeed, people of all ages ran to meet them,each man being eager to be the first to receive an assurance of suchjoyful tidings, by the evidence of his eyes and ears. One continuedtrain extended as far as the Mulvian bridge. The ambassadors,Lucius Veturius Philo, Publius Licinius Varus, and Quintus CaeciliusMetellus, made their way into the forum, surrounded by a crowdof persons of every description; when some asked the ambassadorsthemselves, others their attendants, what had been done; and, as soonas each had heard that the army and general of the enemy had beencut off, that the Roman legions were safe, and the consuls unhurt, heimmediately imparted the joyful intelligence to others, imparting tothem the joy he felt himself. Having with difficulty made their wayinto the senate-house, and the crowd with still more difficulty beingremoved, that they might not mix with the fathers, the letter wasread in the senate; after which the ambassadors were brought intothe general assembly. Lucius Veturius Philo, after reading the letterhimself, gave a more explicit account of all that had occurred, amidstgreat approbation, and at last of general shouting from the assembly,while their minds could scarcely contain their joy. They then ran offin various directions, some to the different temples of the gods,to return thanks, others to their homes, to impart the joyfulintelligence to their wives and children. The senate decreed asupplication for three days, because Marcus Livius and Caius Claudius,the consuls, had cut off the general and legions of the enemy, theirown army being safe. This supplication Caius Hostilius, the praetor,proclaimed in the assembly, and was celebrated both by men and women.During the whole three days all the temples were uniformly crowded,whilst the matrons, dressed in their richest robes, and accompaniedby their children, just as though the war had been brought to aconclusion, and free from every apprehension, offered thanksgivingsto the immortal gods. This victory produced an alteration also in thecondition of the state, so that immediately from this event, just asthough it had been a time of peace, men were not afraid to do businesswith each other, buying, selling, lending, and paying borrowed money.Caius Claudius, the consul, on his return to his camp, ordered thehead of Hasdrubal, which he had carefully kept and brought with him,to be thrown before the advanced guards of the enemy, and the Africanprisoners to be shown to them bound just as they were. Two of thesealso he unbound, and bid them go to Hannibal and tell him what hadoccurred. Hannibal, smitten by such severe distress, at once publicand domestic, is said to have declared that he recognised the destinyof Carthage; and decamping thence with the intention of drawingtogether into Bruttium, the remotest corner of Italy, all hisauxiliaries which he could not protect when widely scattered, removedinto Bruttium the whole state of the Metapontines, summoned away fromtheir former habitations, and also such of the Lucanians as were underhis authority."Book 28,Chapter 1,"At the time when Spain appeared to be relieved in proportion to thedegree in which the weight of the war was removed into Italy, by thepassage of Hasdrubal, another war sprang up there equal in magnitudeto the former. At this juncture, the Romans and Carthaginians thusoccupied Spain: Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, had retired quite to theocean and Gades; the coast of our sea, and almost the whole of thatpart of Spain which lies eastward, was subject to Scipio and theRomans. The new general, Hanno, who had passed over from Africa, tosupply the place of the Barcine Hasdrubal, with a new army, and formeda junction with Mago, having in a short time armed a large numberof men in Celtiberia, which lies in the midway between the two seas,Scipio sent Marcus Silanus against him, with no more than ten thousandinfantry and five hundred horse. Silanus, by marching with all thehaste he could, (though the ruggedness of the roads, and narrowdefiles obstructed with thick woods, which are very frequent in Spain,impeded him,) yet being guided by deserters from Celtiberia, nativesof that place, reached the enemy, anticipating not only messengers buteven all rumour of his coming. From the same source he ascertained,when they were about ten thousand paces from the enemy, that they hadtwo camps, one on each side of the road in which they were marching;that the Celtiberians, a newly-raised army, in number above ninethousand, were on the left, and that the Carthaginian camp wasstationed on the right. The latter was secured and protected byoutposts, watches, and every kind of regular military guard, while theformer was disorderly and neglected, as belonging to barbarians, whowere raw soldiers, and were under the less apprehension, because theywere in their own country. Silanus, concluding that this was the campto be attacked first, ordered the troops to march as much as possibletowards the left, lest he should be observed from any point by theCarthaginian outposts, and sending scouts in advance, pushed ontowards the enemy at a rapid pace."Book 28,Chapter 2,"He was now about three thousand paces from the enemy, when as yetnone of them had perceived him. The ground was covered with craggyplaces, and hills overgrown with bushes. Here in a hollow valley, andon that account unexposed to the view, he ordered his men to sit downand take refreshment. In the mean time the scouts returned, confirmingthe statements of the deserters. Then the Romans, collecting theirbaggage in the centre, took arms, and marched to battle in regulararray. They were a thousand paces off when they were descried bythe enemy, when suddenly all began to be in a state of hurry andconfusion. At the first shout and tumult, Mago quitted the camp androde up at full speed. As there were in the Celtiberian army fourthousand targeteers and two hundred horsemen, this regular legion, asit formed the flower of his troops, he stationed in the first line;the rest, composed of light-armed, he posted in reserve. While he wasleading them out of the camp thus marshalled, the Romans dischargedtheir javelins at them before they had scarcely cleared the rampart.The Spaniards stooped down to avoid the javelins thrown at them bythe enemy, and then rose up to discharge their own in turn; which theRomans having received according to their custom in close array, withtheir shields firmly united, they then engaged foot to foot, and beganto fight with their swords. But the ruggedness of the ground, whileit rendered ineffectual the agility of the Celtiberians who wereaccustomed to a skirmishing kind of battle, was at the same time notunfavourable to the Romans, who were accustomed to a steady kind offight, except that the narrow passes and the bushes, which grew hereand there, broke their ranks, and they were compelled to engage oneagainst one and two against two, as if matched together. The samecircumstance which obstructed the enemy's flight, delivered themup, as it were, bound for slaughter. And now when almost all thetargeteers had been slain, the light-armed and the Carthaginians,who had come up to their assistance from the other camp, havingbeen thrown into confusion, were put to the sword. Not more than twothousand of the infantry, and all the cavalry, fled from the fieldwith Mago before the battle was well begun. The other general, Hanno,was taken alive, together with those who came up when the battle wasnow decided. Almost the whole of the cavalry and the veteran infantry,following Mago in his flight, came to Hasdrubal on the tenth day inthe province of Gades. The newly-raised Celtiberian troops, stealingoff to the neighbouring woods, fled thence to their homes. By thisvery seasonable victory, a stop was put to a war which was not by anymeans so considerable as that to which it would have grown, had theenemy been allowed, after having prevailed upon the Celtiberians tojoin them, to solicit other nations also to take up arms. Scipio,therefore, having liberally bestowed the highest commendations onSilanus, and entertaining a hope that he might bring the war to atermination, if he did not impede it by a want of activity on his ownpart, proceeded into the remotest part of Spain against Hasdrubal. TheCarthaginian, who then happened to be encamped in Baetica, in order toprevent his allies from wavering in their allegiance, retired quite tothe ocean and Gades, in a manner much more resembling a flight than amarch. He was afraid, however; that while he kept his forces together,he should form the principal object of attack. Before he crossed thestrait to Gades he sent them into different cities, that they mightboth provide for their own safety by the help of walls, and for thatof the town by their arms."Book 28,Chapter 3,"Scipio, seeing the enemy's forces thus distributed, and that tocarry about his forces to each of the several cities would be rathertedious than important, marched his army back. Not to leave all thatcountry, however, to the Carthaginians, he sent his brother, LuciusScipio, at the head of ten thousand foot and one thousand horse,to besiege the most important city of that quarter, called by thebarbarians Orinx, and situated on the borders of the Milesians, anation of Spain so called. The soil is fertile, and even silver isdug out of it by the inhabitants. This place served as a fort toHasdrubal, from which he might make incursions on the inland states.Scipio encamped near the city. Before he formed his lines round it, hesent to the gates to sound the inclinations of the inhabitants, by adirect interview, and persuade them to make trial of the friendship ofthe Romans rather than of their power. As they answered nothing of afriendly nature, he threw a double trench and rampart round the place,dividing his army into three parts, in order that one division mightassault it while the other two rested. The first of these beginningthe attack, a furious and doubtful contest ensued. It was by no meanseasy to approach and bring the ladders to the walls, on account of theweapons which fell upon them; and even of those persons who had raisedthem, some were thrown down with forks made for the purpose, otherswere in danger of being laid hold of by iron grapples, and draggedup hanging to the wall. Scipio, seeing that the contest was equalizedowing to the fewness of his party, and that the enemy, fighting fromthe wall, were superior to him, called off the first division andattacked them with the two others together. This so terrified thebesieged, who were already fatigued with fighting with the former,that not only the townsmen forsook the walls in sudden flight, but theCarthaginian garrison, fearing that the town had been betrayed, alsoquitted their posts and collected themselves into a body. Upon thisthe inhabitants began to be alarmed, lest if the enemy broke into thetown they should kill all they met indiscriminately, Carthaginian orSpaniard. They therefore suddenly threw open the gates and rushedout of the town, holding their shields before them, lest any weaponsshould be cast at them from a distance, and stretching out to viewtheir bare right hands, that it might be seen they had thrown awaytheir swords. Whether this was not observed, in consequence of thedistance, or whether some deception was suspected, is not known; butan attack was made on the deserters, and they were put to death as ahostile force. Through this gate the enemy marched into the city inbattle-array. The other gates were cut through and broken down withaxes and sledges; and as each horseman entered, he galloped off toseize the forum, as had been ordered. A body of veteran troops werealso added to the horse to support them. The legionary troops spreadthemselves in every part of the city, but neither killed norplundered any, except such as defended themselves with arms. All theCarthaginians were put under guard, with more than three hundred ofthe inhabitants, who had shut the gates. The rest had the town putinto their hands, and their property restored. About two thousand ofthe enemy fell in the assault on this city, and not more than ninetyof the Romans."Book 28,Chapter 4,"As the taking of this town was a source of great joy to those whoeffected it, as well as to the general and the rest of the army, sotheir approach to their camp also presented a splendid spectacle,on account of the immense crowd of captives they drove beforethem. Scipio, having bestowed high commendations upon his brother,representing the capture of Orinx as equal in importance to thecapture of Carthage by himself, led his forces back into hitherSpain. He could not make an attempt on Gades, or pursue the armyof Hasdrubal, now dispersed through all parts of the province, inconsequence of the approach of winter. He therefore dismissed thelegions into winter quarters, and sent his brother Lucius Scipio withHanno, the enemy's general, and other distinguished prisoners, toRome, while he retired himself to Tarraco. During the same year, theRoman fleet under Marcus Valerius Laevinus, the proconsul, sailingover from Sicily into Africa, devastated to a wide extent the fieldsabout Utica and Carthage. They carried off plunder from the remotestborders of the Carthaginian territory around the very walls of Utica.On their return to Sicily they were met by a Carthaginian fleet ofseventy ships of war, of which seventeen were taken and four sunk; therest were dispersed and compelled to fly. The Romans, victorious bothby land and sea, returned to Lilybaeum with immense booty of everykind. The ships of the enemy having thus been driven from the wholesea, large supplies of corn were conveyed to Rome."Book 28,Chapter 5,"In the beginning of the summer in which these events occurred,Publius Sulpicius, proconsul, and king Attalus, having passed thewinter at Aegina, as before observed, united their fleets, consistingof twenty-three Roman quinqueremes and thirty-five belonging to theking, and proceeded to Lemnos. Philip also, that he might be preparedfor every kind of measure, whether it should be necessary to meetthe enemy on land or sea, came down to the coast of Demetrias andappointed to his army a day on which to meet him at Larissa. Onthe news of the king's arrival, ambassadors from his allies came toDemetrias from all sides. For the Aetolians, inspirited both bytheir alliance with the Romans and the approach of king Attalus, wereravaging the neighbouring states; not only the Acarnanians, Boeotians,and Euboeans were very much alarmed, but the Achaeans also werekept in a state of terror, both by the hostile proceedings of theAetolians, and also by Machanidas, tyrant of Lacedaemon, who hadencamped at a short distance from the borders of the Argives. All ofthese stating the dangers which threatened their possessions, bothby land and sea, entreated succour from the king. Philip receivedaccounts even from his own kingdom, that things were not in a state oftranquillity; that both Scerdilaedus and Pleuratus were in motion,and that some of the Thracians, and particularly the Maedians, wouldcertainly make incursions on the contiguous provinces of Macedonia,should the king be occupied with a distant war. The Boeotians, indeed,and the people inhabiting the inland parts of Greece, told him thatthe Aetolians had obstructed by a ditch and rampart the straits ofThermopylae, where the road is very narrow and confined, in order toprevent their passing to the assistance of the allied states. Somany disturbances arising on all hands were sufficient to awaken aninactive general. He dismissed the ambassadors, promising to assistthem all according as opportunity and circumstances allowed. For thepresent, he sent to Peparethus a body of troops to garrison thecity, for this was the most urgent business, as information had beenreceived thence that Attalus, crossing over to Lemnos, was devastatingall the neighbouring country. He sent Polyphantas with a smalldetachment to Boeotia, and also Menippus, one of his guards, with onethousand targeteers (the target is not unlike the ordinary buckler)to Chalcis. Five hundred Agrianians were added, that every part of theisland might be secured. He went himself to Scotussa, and ordered theMacedonian soldiers to be removed thither from Larissa. Here he heardthat the Aetolians had been summoned to an assembly at Heraclea, andthat king Attalus was to come and advise with them as to the conductof the war. Determining to interrupt this meeting by his suddenapproach, he led his troops by forced marches to Heraclea, where hearrived just after the assembly had broken up. However, he destroyedthe crops, which were nearly ripe, particularly those round the Aenianbay. He then marched back to Scotussa, and leaving there the mainarmy, retired to Demetrias with the royal guards. In order to beprepared against every attempt of the enemy, he sent persons hence toPhocis, Euboea, and Peparethus, to select elevated situations, fromwhich fires lighted upon them might be seen from a distance. He fixeda watch-tower on Tisaeum, a mountain whose summit is prodigiouslyhigh, in order that when the enemy made any attempt he might instantlyreceive intimation of it by means of fires lighted up at a distance.The Roman general and king Attalus then passed over from Peparethus toNicaea, and thence sailed to Orcus, the first city of Euboea, onthe left as you proceed to Chalcis and the Euripus from the bay ofDemetrias. It was agreed upon between Attalus and Sulpicius, that theRomans should attack the town on the side next the sea, and the king'sforces on the land side."Book 28,Chapter 6,"Four days after the fleet arrived, they attacked the city. Thattime had been employed in private conferences with Plator, whomPhilip had put in command of the place. The city has two citadels,one overhanging the coasts, the other in the middle of the town, fromwhich there is a subterraneous passage to the ocean, whose entrancenext the sea is defended by a strong fortification, a tower fivestories high. Here the affair commenced with a most furious contest,the tower being furnished with all kinds of weapons, and engines andmachines of every kind for the purpose of the assault having beenlanded from the ships. While the eyes and attention of all were turnedto that quarter, Plator opened one of the gates and received theRomans into the citadel next the sea, which they instantly becamemasters of. The inhabitants, driven thence, fled to the other citadelin the middle of the city; but there had been troops posted there toshut the gates against them; so that, being thus excluded, theywere surrounded and either slain or made prisoners. Meanwhile theMacedonian garrison stood under the wall of the citadel, formed into acompact body, neither confusedly attempting a retreat, nor obstinatelyengaging in a contest. These men Plator, after obtaining permissionfrom Sulpicius, put on board ships and landed them at Demetrias inPhthiotis; he himself withdrew to Attalus. Sulpicius, elated with thesuccess at Oreum, gained with so much ease, proceeded to Chalciswith his victorious fleet, where the issue by no means answeredhis expectations. The sea, which is wide on both sides, being herecontracted into a narrow strait, might perhaps, at first view,exhibit the appearance of two harbours facing the two entrances of theEuripus. It would be difficult to find a station more dangerous forshipping; for not only do the winds come down with great violence fromthe high mountains on each side, but the strait itself of the Euripusdoes not ebb and flow seven times a day at stated times, as isreported, but the current changing irregularly, like the wind, nowthis way now that, is hurried along like a torrent rolling headlongdown a steep mountain, so that no quiet is given to vessels there dayor night. But not only did so perilous a station receive his ships,but the town was strong and impregnable, covered on one side by thesea, and very well fortified on the other towards the land, secured bya strong garrison, and above all, by the fidelity of the praefects andprincipal men, which was wavering and unsettled at Oreum. Thoughthe business had been rashly undertaken, the Roman still acted withprudence, in so far as he speedily gave up the attempt, after he hadseen all the difficulties which surrounded him, that he might notwaste time, and passed his fleet over from thence to Cynus in Locris,the port of the town of Opus, which is one mile distant from the sea."Book 28,Chapter 7,"Philip had received notice of this from Oreum, by the signalfires; but through the treachery of Plator they were raised from thewatch-tower at a later period. As he was not a match for the enemy'sforces at sea, it was difficult for him to approach the island; andthus, by delay, the opportunity was lost. He moved with promptnessto the assistance of Chalcis as soon as he received the signal. Foralthough Chalcis is a city of the same island, yet it is separatedfrom the continent by so narrow a strait, that they communicate bymeans of a bridge, and the approach to it is easier by land than bywater. Philip therefore, going from Demetrias to Scotussa, and settingout thence at the third watch, dislodged the guard, put to flight theAetolians who kept the pass of Thermopylae, and drove the enemy inconfusion to Heraclea, marching in one day to Elatia in Phocis, adistance of above sixty miles. Almost on the same day the town of Opuswas taken and plundered by Attalus. Sulpicius had given it up to theking because Oreum had been plundered a few days before by the Romansoldiers, the royal soldiers not having shared the booty. The Romanfleet having retired thither, Attalus, who was not aware of Philip'sapproach, wasted time in levying contributions from the principalinhabitants, and so sudden was his coming, that had he not beendescried by some Cretans, who happened to go farther from the townthan usual in quest of forage, he might have been surprised. He fledhastily to the sea and his ships, without arms, and in the greatestdisorder. Just as they were putting off from the land Philip arrived,and even from the shore created much alarm among the mariners. Hereturned thence to Opus, accusing both gods and men, because he hadlost an opportunity of so great importance, almost snatched from hishands. He also reproached the Opuntians with the like anger, becausethey had, immediately on sight of the enemy, made almost a voluntarysurrender, though they might have prolonged the siege till hisarrival. Having settled affairs at Opus, he proceeded thence toThronium. Attalus, too, at first retired from Oreum; but therereceiving intelligence that Prusias, king of Bithynia, had invaded hiskingdom, he withdrew his attention from the Romans and the Aetolianwar, and passed over into Asia. Sulpicius also withdrew his fleet toAegina, from whence he had set out in the beginning of spring. Philiptook Thronium with as little difficulty as Attalus had at Opus. It wasinhabited by foreigners, fugitives from Thebes in Phthiotis, who, onthe capture of their own town by Philip, had fled to the protection ofthe Aetolians, and received from them a city as a settlement whichhad been laid waste and desolated in a former war by the same Philip.Having recovered Thronium, as has been a little before mentioned, heset out thence; and having taken Tritonos and Drymae, inconsiderabletowns of Doris, he came thence to Elatia, where he had orderedthe ambassadors of Ptolemy and the Rhodians to wait for him. Whileconsulting there as to the best method of bringing the Aetolian war toa conclusion, (for these ambassadors attended the late council ofthe Romans and Aetolians at Heraclea,) intelligence is brought thatMachanidas intended to attack the Elians while busied in preparing forthe celebration of the Olympic games. Thinking it his duty to preventsuch an attempt, he dismissed the ambassadors with a gracious answerto the effect, that he had neither caused the war, nor would he beany obstacle to the restoration of peace, if it should be possible onequitable and honourable terms; then marching quickly through Boeotiahe came down from Megara, and thence to Corinth, where receivingsupplies of provisions, he went to Phlius and Pheneus. And now, whenhe had proceeded as far as Heraea, having received intelligence thatMachanidas, terrified at the news of his approach, had retreatedto Lacedaemon, he betook himself to Aegium, where the Achaeans wereassembled in council, expecting at the same time to meet there aCarthaginian fleet, which he had sent for, in order that he mightaccomplish something by sea. But the Carthaginians had left a few daysbefore, and were gone to the Oxean islands; and thence, hearingthat the Romans and Attalus had left Oreum, to the harbours of theAcarnanians, for they feared that it was intended to attack them,and that they would be overpowered while within the straits of Rhium,which is the name of the entrance of the Corinthian bay."Book 28,Chapter 8,"Philip was grieved and vexed when he reflected, that though heproceeded with the utmost speed on all occasions, yet he had notcome up in time to accomplish any one object, and that fortune hadfrustrated his activity by snatching away every advantage frombefore his eyes. In the assembly, however, concealing his chagrin, hediscoursed with elated spirits, calling gods and men to witness, that""he had never been wanting at any time or place, so as not to repairinstantly wherever the enemy's arms resounded, but that it wasdifficult to calculate whether the war was carried on more boldly byhim or more pusillanimously by the enemy. Such was the manner inwhich Attalus had slipped out of his hands from Opus; Sulpicius fromChalcis; and so, within these few days, Machanidas. That flight,however, was not always successful; and that that should not beesteemed a difficult war in which victory would be certain if theenemy could be brought to a regular engagement. He had alreadyobtained one very great advantage, which was a confession on the partof the enemy themselves, that they were not a match for him; and in ashort time,"" he said, ""he would be in possession of undoubted victory;for that he would engage with him with a result no better thantheir expectations."" The allies listened to the king with greatsatisfaction. He then gave up to the Achaeans Heraera and Triphylia.Aliphera he restored to the Megalopolitans, they having broughtsatisfactory proof that it belonged to their territories. Then havingreceived some ships from the Achaeans, three quadriremes and threebiremes, he sailed to Anticyra, whence with seven quinqueremes andmore than twenty barks, which he had sent to the bay of Corinth tojoin the Carthaginian fleet, he proceeded to Erythrae, a town ofthe Aetolians near Eupalium, where he made a descent. He was notunobserved by the Aetolians; for all who were either in the fieldsor in the neighbouring forts of Potidania and Apollonia, fled to thewoods and mountains. The cattle which they could not drive off intheir haste they seized and put on board. He sent Nicias, praetor ofthe Achaeans, to Aegium with these and the other booty; and then goingto Corinth, ordered his army to march by land through Boeotia, whilehe himself, sailing from Cenchreae along the coast of Attica, roundthe promontory of Sunium, reached Chalcis, having passed almostthrough the midst of the enemy's fleet. After commending in thehighest terms their fidelity and bravery, as neither fear nor hopehad influenced their minds, and after exhorting them to show the samefidelity in maintaining the alliance, he sailed to Oreum; and havingplaced such of the chief inhabitants as chose to fly, rather thansurrender to the Romans, in the command of the city and the directionof affairs, he sailed over from Euboea to Demetrias, from which placehe at first set out to succour his allies. After this, having laid thekeels of one hundred ships of war at Cassandrea, and collected a largenumber of ship carpenters for the completion of that business, andas both the departure of Attalus and the seasonable assistance he hadbrought to his allies had tranquillized affairs in Greece, he retiredinto his own dominions, in order to make war upon the Dardanians."Book 28,Chapter 9,"Just at the close of the summer during which these operations werecarried on in Greece, when Quintus Fabius, son of Maximus, ambassadorfrom Marcus Livius the consul, brought a message to Rome to thesenate, to the effect, that the consul considered that Lucius Portiuswith his legions formed a sufficient protection for the province, thathe might himself retire thence, and that the consular army might bewithdrawn, the fathers directed that not only Livius should return tothe city, but also his colleague, Caius Claudius. The only differencemade between them in the decree was, that they ordered the army ofMarcus Livius to be led back, and the legions of Nero to remainin their province opposed to Hannibal. The consuls agreed betweenthemselves by letter, that as they had conducted the affairs of thecommonwealth with unanimity, they should arrive at the city at thesame time, though they came from different quarters. He who arrivedfirst at Praeneste was enjoined to wait there for his colleague. It sohappened that they both came to Praeneste on the same day, and thence,sending a proclamation before them, directing that there should bea full attendance of the senate at the temple of Bellona, three daysafter, they came up to the city, when they were met by the whole bodyof the inhabitants. Not only did the whole body pour around themand salute them, but each person individually, desiring to touch thevictorious right hands of the consuls, some congratulated them, whileothers thanked them because by their services the state had beenpreserved. In the senate, when, having made a recital of theirservices according to the custom observed by all generals, they hadrequested, that ""in consideration of the brave and successful conductof the affairs of the commonwealth, honours should be paid to theimmortal gods, and they themselves enter the city in triumph;"" thefathers replied, that ""they most willingly decreed those things whichthey requested in gratitude to the gods in the first instance, and,next to them, to the consuls."" A supplication in the name of both,and a triumph to both of them, having been decreed, lest after havingcarried on the war with entire unanimity they should have a separatetriumph, they made the following agreement; that ""since both theservice had been performed in the province of Marcus Livius, and hewas in possession of the command on the day on which the battle wasfought, and further, that as the army of Livius had been withdrawnand had come to Rome, while Nero's could not be withdrawn from theprovince, Marcus Livius should enter the city in a four-horse chariotand followed by the soldiers; Caius Claudius on horseback withoutsoldiers."" This plan of associating the generals in the triumphincreased the glory of both, but particularly of him who had yieldedto his colleague in the honours he received, as much as he surpassedhim in merit. The people said, that ""the general on horseback hadtraversed the whole length of Italy in the space of six days, and hadfought a pitched battle with Hasdrubal in Gaul, on the very day onwhich Hannibal supposed that he was occupying a camp pitched in Apuliato oppose him. That thus one consul, acting in defence of eitherextremity of Italy against two leaders, had opposed against one hisskill, against the other his person. That the name of Nero had beensufficient to confine Hannibal within his camp, while with regardto Hasdrubal, by what, but his arrival, had he been overwhelmed andannihilated? The other consul might move along raised aloft in achariot, drawn if he pleased by a number of horses, but that the realtriumph was his who was conveyed by one horse; and that Nero, thoughhe should go on foot, would be immortalized, whether on account of theglory he had acquired in the war, or the contempt he had shown for itin the triumph."" Such continual expressions of the spectators attendedNero all the way to the Capitol. The money they brought into thetreasury was three hundred thousand sesterces, with eighty thousandasses of brass. Marcus Livius distributed among the soldiers fifty-sixasses each. Caius Claudius promised the same sum to his absent troopswhen he returned to the army. It was observed that more verses werewritten by the soldiery upon Caius Claudius in their jocular style,than upon their own consul; that the horsemen highly extolled LuciusVeturius and Quintus Caecilius, lieutenant-generals, and exhorted thecommons to create them consuls for the ensuing year; that the consulsadded their authority to the recommendation of the knights, relatingin the public assembly the following day with what courage andfidelity their two lieutenant-generals in particular had served them."Book 28,Chapter 10,"When the time for the elections approached, and it was resolvedthat it should be held by a dictator, the consul Caius Claudiusnominated as dictator his colleague Marcus Livius, who appointedQuintus Caecilius his master of the horse. Lucius Veturius and QuintusCaecilius were created consuls by Marcus Livius the dictator, thelatter being then master of the horse. After this the election ofpraetors was held. The persons appointed were, Caius Servilius, MarcusCaecilius Metellus, Titus Claudius Asellus, and Quintus MamiliusTurinus, who was at that time plebeian aedile. When the elections werefinished, the dictator, having abdicated his office and dismissed hisarmy, set out for his province of Etruria, according to a decree ofthe senate, to make inquiry what states of the Tuscans and Umbrianshad formed schemes of revolt from the Romans to Hasdrubal at the timeof his approach, and what states had assisted him with auxiliaries,provisions, or succours of any kind. Such were the transactions thisyear at home and abroad. The Roman games were thrice repeated in fullby the curule aediles, Cneius Servilius Caepio and Servius CorneliusLentulus. In the same manner the plebeian games also were oncerepeated entire by the plebeian aediles, Manius Pomponius Matho andQuintus Mamilius Thurinus.In the thirteenth year of the Punic war, when Lucius Veturius Philoand Quintus Caecilius Metellus were consuls, Bruttium was assigned toboth of them, as their province, to carry on the war with Hannibal.The praetors then cast lots for their provinces: Marcus CaeciliusMetellus had the city jurisdiction; Quintus Mamilius, the foreign;Caius Servilius, Sicily; Tiberius Claudius, Sardinia. The armies weredistributed thus: to one of the consuls was given the army whichCaius Claudius the consul of the former year, to the other that whichQuintus Claudius the propraetor, had commanded, consisting of twolegions each. It was decreed that Marcus Livius, proconsul, who wascontinued in command for the year, should take the two legions ofvolunteer slaves from Caius Terentius the propraetor, and that QuintusMamilius, transferring his judicial business to his colleague, shouldoccupy Gaul with the army which Lucius Porcius, the praetor, hadcommanded, with orders to lay waste the lands of those Gauls whohad revolted to the Carthaginians on the approach of Hasdrubal. Theprotection of Sicily was assigned to Caius Servilius with the twolegions which fought at Cannae, in the same manner as Caius Mamiliushad held it. The old army which Aulus Hostilius had commanded wasconveyed out of Sardinia, and the consuls enlisted a new legion, whichTiberius Claudius might take over with him. Quintus Claudius andCaius Hostilius Tubulus were continued in command for a year, that theformer might hold Tarentum as his province, the latter, Capua. MarcusValerius, the proconsul, to whom had been committed the protectionof the sea-coast round Sicily, was ordered to deliver thirty shipsto Caius Servilius, and return to the city with all the rest of thefleet."Book 28,Chapter 11,"In a state where the greatest anxiety prevailed, in consequenceof the very critical situation in which the war stood, and where allevents, prosperous or adverse, were attributed to the interposition ofthe gods, accounts of many prodigies were received; that the temple ofJupiter at Tarracina, and that of Mater Matuta at Satricum, had beenstruck by lightning. The people of Satricum were no less terrifiedby two snakes gliding into the temple of Jupiter by the very doors. Areport was brought from Antium, that bloody ears of corn had been seenby the reapers. At Caere a pig with two heads had been littered, anda lamb yeaned which was both male and female. Intelligence was broughtthat two suns had been seen at Alba, and that light had suddenlyappeared during night at Fregellae. An ox was reported to have spokenin the Roman territory. A copious perspiration was said to have exudedfrom the altar of Neptune, in the Flaminian circus; and the templesof Ceres, Safety, and Quirinus were said to have been struck bylightning. The consuls were directed to expiate these prodigies withvictims of the larger sort, and to make a supplication for one day.These things were executed according to a decree of the senate. Theextinction of the fire in the temple of Vesta struck more terrorupon the minds of men than all the prodigies which were reported fromabroad, or seen at home; and the vestal, who had the guarding of itfor that night, was scourged by the command of Publius Liciniusthe pontiff. Although this event was not appointed by the gods as aportent, but had happened through human neglect, yet it was thoughtproper that it should be expiated with victims of the larger sort, andthat a supplication should be made at the temple of Vesta.Before the consuls set out for the campaign, they were cautioned bythe senate to take care that the common people should be brought backinto the country; for since, through the goodness of the gods, thewar was removed from the city of Rome and Latium, the country mightbe inhabited without fear. That it was most inconsistent that greatercare should be taken in cultivating Sicily than Italy. But it was amatter by no means easy for the people, the free labourers having beencut off by war, and there being a scarcity of slaves, their cattlehaving been carried off as booty, and the farmhouses pulled down orburnt. A large number, however, compelled by the authority of theconsuls, returned into the country. The mention of this affairhad been occasioned by ambassadors of Placentia and Cremona, whocomplained that their lands were being invaded and laid waste bythe neighbouring Gauls; that a large portion of their settlers haddispersed; that their cities were thinly inhabited, and their landsdevastated and deserted. Mamilius the praetor was charged with theprotection of the colonies from the enemy. The consuls, in conformitywith a decree of the senate, issued an edict that all who werecitizens of Cremona and Placentia should return to those coloniesbefore a certain day; after which, in the beginning of spring, theyset out for the campaign. Quintus Caecilius, the consul, receivedthe army from Caius Nero; Lucius Veturius received his from QuintusClaudius the propraetor, filling it up with new-raised soldiers,whom he had himself enlisted. The consuls marched their army into theterritory of Consentia, and devastating the country on all hands,when the troops were loaded with plunder, they were thrown into suchconfusion by some Bruttians and Numidian spearmen, who attacked themin a narrow defile, that not only the booty but the troops werein danger. There was more of confusion, however than fighting; andsending the booty in advance, the legions themselves also escaped intoa place free from danger. Proceeding thence into Lucania, the whole ofthat people returned, without a contest, into subjection to the Romanpeople."Book 28,Chapter 12,"No action with Hannibal took place this year; for neither did hepresent himself after the public and personal calamity so recentlyinflicted, and the Romans did not provoke him while he remained quiet,such power did they consider that single general possessed, thoughevery thing else around him was falling into ruin. Indeed I know notwhether he was not more deserving of admiration in adversity than inprosperity; inasmuch as though he carried on a war in the territoryof enemies through a period of thirteen years, at so great a distancefrom home, with varying success, and with, an army not composed of hisown countrymen, but made up of the offscouring of all nations,without communion of laws, customs, or language, different in theirappearance, their dress, their arms, their religious ceremonies andobservances, and I had almost said, their gods; yet he so effectuallyunited them by some one bond, that no disturbance ever arose eitheramong the soldiers themselves, or between them and their general,though he often wanted money to pay them, and provisions, as beingin a hostile country, through want of which, in the former Punic war,many dreadful transactions had occurred between the generals and theirsoldiers. But after the destruction of Hasdrubal and his army, inwhich all hopes of victory had been treasured up; and after retiringfrom the possession of every other part of Italy by withdrawing intoBruttium, one corner of it; to whom does it not appear wonderful thatno disturbance arose in the camp? For to other circumstances this alsowas added, that he had no nope of subsisting his army, except from thelands of Bruttium, which, though they were all cultivated, would bevery insufficient for the maintenance of so large an army. Besides,many of the youth were drawn off from the cultivation of the fields,and engaged in the war; and a custom also prevailed among the peopleof that nation, grafted on a naturally depraved inclination, ofcarrying on a predatory kind of warfare. Nor did he receive anysupplies from home, where they were anxious about the retention ofSpain, as if every thing was going on prosperously in Italy. In Spainthe state of affairs was in one respect similar, but in another widelydifferent; similar in that the Carthaginians, having been defeatedwith the loss of their general, had been driven to the remotest coastof that country, even to the ocean; but different, because Spain, bothfrom the nature of the country and the genius of its inhabitants, wasbetter adapted not only than Italy, but than any other part of theworld, for renewing a war. And accordingly, therefore, though this wasthe first of the provinces on the continent which the Romans entered,it was the last which was at length reduced, in the present age, underthe conduct and auspices of Augustus Caesar. Here Hasdrubal, son ofGisgo, the greatest and most renowned general concerned in the war,next to the Barcine family, returning from Gades, and encouraged inhis hopes of reviving the war by Mago, son of Hamilcar, by meansof levies made throughout the Farther Spain, armed as many as fiftythousand foot and four thousand five hundred horse. With regard tohis mounted force, authors are pretty much agreed, but some state thatseventy thousand infantry were led to the city Silpia. Here the twoCarthaginian generals sat down on open plains, with a determinationnot to avoid a battle."Book 28,Chapter 13,"When Scipio received an account of the collection of so large anarmy, he felt convinced that he would not be a match for so great amultitude with the Roman legions only, without making a show at leastof the auxiliary troops of the barbarians; at the same time that hedid not think it right that they should form so large a portion ofhis force as to occasion important consequences if they shouldchange sides, which had brought ruin upon his father and his uncle.Therefore, sending forward Silanus to Colca, who was sovereign oftwenty-eight towns, to receive from him the infantry and cavalry,which he promised to enlist during the winter, he himself set out fromTarraco; and collecting small bodies of auxiliaries from his allies,who lay near his road as he proceeded, he came to Castulo. To thisplace Silanus led the auxiliaries, consisting of three thousandinfantry and five hundred horse. Thence he advanced to the city ofBaecula, with his entire army of countrymen and allies, foot andhorse, amounting to forty-five thousand. Mago and Masinissa attackedthem with the whole body of their cavalry while forming their camp,and would have dispersed those engaged in the works, had not a partyof horse, concealed by Scipio behind an eminence conveniently situatedfor the purpose, unexpectedly charged them when rushing on to theattack, and, ere the battle was well begun, routed all the mostforward, both those who had advanced nearest the rampart, and thosewho were foremost in charging the very workmen. With the rest of thetroops who came up with their standards, and in order of march, thecontest lasted longer, and was for a considerable time doubtful. Butwhen first the light cohorts from the outposts, and then the troopswithdrawn from the works and ordered to take arms, came up, being morenumerous than those which had been engaged, and fresh while they werefatigued, and now a large body of armed troops rushed from the campto the battle, the Carthaginians and Numidians at once turned theirbacks. At first they moved off in troops without breaking their ranks,through fear or precipitation; but afterwards, when the Romans pressedfuriously upon their rear, and they were unable to bear the violenceof their attack, then at length, utterly regardless of order,they fled precipitately in every direction, as suited each man'sconvenience. And although, in consequence of this battle, the spiritsof the Romans were considerably raised, and those of the enemydepressed, yet, for several days following, the horsemen andlight-armed troops never ceased from skirmishes."Book 28,Chapter 14,"After having made sufficient trial of their strength in theseslight engagements, Hasdrubal first led out his forces for battle,and then the Romans also advanced. But both the armies stood drawn upbefore their ramparts; and as neither party began the attack, and thesun was now going down, the Carthaginian first, and then the Roman,led back his troops into the camp. The same occurred for several days.The Carthaginian was always the first to lead out his troops into thefield, and the first to give the signal for retiring, when they wereweary with standing. Neither party sallied from their posts, nor was aweapon discharged, or a word uttered. On one side the Romans occupiedthe centre, on the other, the Carthaginians and Africans together; theallies occupied the wings, which were composed of Spaniards onboth sides. The elephants which stood before the Carthaginian line,appeared at a distance like castles. It was now commonly talked of inboth camps, that they would fight in the order in which they hadstood when drawn up, and that their centres, composed of Romans andCarthaginians, who were the principals in the war, would engage withequal courage and strength. When Scipio perceived that this was firmlybelieved, he studiously altered all his arrangements against the dayon which he intended to fight. He issued orders through the camp atevening, that the men and horses should be refreshed and fed beforedaylight, and that the horsemen, armed themselves, should keep theirhorses bridled and saddled. When it was scarcely yet daylight, hesent all his cavalry, with the light troops, against the Carthaginianoutposts, and then without delay advanced himself, at the head of theheavy body of the legions, having strengthened his wings with Romansoldiers, and placed the allies in the centre, contrary to the fullanticipations of his own men and of the enemy. Hasdrubal, alarmed bythe shout of the cavalry, sprang out of his tent, and, perceiving atumult before the rampart, and his own troops in a state of hurry andconfusion, the standards of the legions gleaming at a distance, andthe plain filled with the enemy, immediately sent out the whole bodyof his cavalry against the horsemen of the enemy; marching himselfout of the camp, at the head of the infantry, without departing at allfrom the usual arrangement in forming his line. The battle between thecavalry had continued for a long time doubtful; nor could they decideit themselves, because, when repulsed, which was the case in a manneralternately, they had a safe retreat upon the line of infantry. Butwhen the armies were not more than five hundred paces distant fromeach other, Scipio, sounding a retreat and opening his files, receivedinto the midst of them the whole body of his cavalry and light-armedtroops; and dividing them into two parts, placed them in reservebehind the wings. After this, when it was now time to commence thebattle, he ordered the Spaniards, who formed the centre, to advance ata slow pace; he himself sent a messenger from the right wing, for thathe commanded, to Silanus and Marcius to extend the wing on the left inthe same manner as they should see him extend that on the right, andengage the enemy with the light-armed of the horse and foot, beforethe two centres could meet. The wings being thus extended, theyadvanced against the enemy at a rapid pace, with three cohortsof infantry, and three troops of horse, each with the addition ofskirmishers, the rest following them in an oblique line. There was adepression in the centre of the line, because the battalions of theSpaniards advanced slower than the rest, and the wings had alreadyencountered the enemy, when the veteran Carthaginians and Africans hadnot yet come within distance to discharge their darts; nor dared theyrun in different directions to the wings to assist them when fighting,lest they should expose their centre to the enemy approaching overagainst them. The wings were hard pressed, by a twofold attack; thecavalry, the light-armed, and the skirmishers, wheeling round, chargedtheir flanks, while the cohorts pressed them hard in front, in orderto separate the wings from the rest of the line."Book 28,Chapter 15,"The battle was now extremely unequal in every part, both becausean irregular band of Balearians and raw Spaniards were opposed toRoman and Latin soldiers, and further, because, as the day was nowgetting on, Hasdrubal's troops began to grow languid, having beendispirited by the alarm in the morning, and compelled to go outhastily into the field, without refreshing themselves with food.Scipio had designedly spun out the day, in order that the battle mighttake place at a late hour; for it was not until the seventh hour thatthe battalions of infantry charged the wings. It was considerablylater before the battle reached the centres, so that the heat from themeridian sun, and the fatigue of standing under arms, together withhunger and thirst, enfeebled their bodies before they engaged theenemy. Thus they stood still, supporting themselves upon theirshields. In addition to their other misfortunes, the elephantstoo, terrified at the tumultuous kind of attack of the cavalry, theskirmishers, and the light-armed, had transferred themselves from thewings to the centre. Fatigued therefore in mind and body, they gaveground, preserving their ranks, however, just as though the armywere retreating entire at the command of their general. But when thevictors, perceiving that the enemy had given way, charged them on allsides with increased vehemence on that very account, so that the shockcould hardly be sustained, though Hasdrubal endeavoured to stop themand hinder them from retiring, vociferating, ""that there were hillson their rear, and a safe refuge if they would retreat withoutprecipitation;"" yet, fear getting the better of their sense of shame,and all those who were nearest the enemy giving way, they immediatelyturned their backs, and all gave themselves up to disorderly flight.The first place they halted at was the foot of the hills, wherethey endeavoured to recall the soldiers to their ranks, theRomans hesitating to advance their line up the opposite steep; butafterwards, when they saw them push on briskly, renewing their flight,they were driven into their camp in extreme alarm. Nor were the Romansfar from the rampart; and such was their impetuosity, that they wouldhave taken their camp had not so violent a shower of rain suddenlypoured down, while, as is usually the case, the solar rays darted withthe greatest intensity between the clouds surcharged with water, thatthe victors with difficulty returned to their camp. Some were evendeterred, by superstition, from making any further attempts that day.Though night and the rain invited the Carthaginians to take necessaryrest, yet, as their fears and the danger would not allow them todelay, as it was expected that the enemy would assault their camp assoon as it was light, they raised their rampart by stones collectedfrom the neighbouring valleys around them on all sides, with thedetermination to defend themselves by works, since there was butlittle protection in their arms. But the desertion of their alliesmade it appear safer to fly than stay. Attanes, prince of theTurdetani, began this revolt; he deserted at the head of a numerousband of his countrymen. Then two fortified towns, together with theirgarrisons, were delivered up by their praefects to the Romans. And,lest the evil should spread more widely, now that the dispositionto revolt from the Carthaginians had evinced itself in one instance,Hasdrubal decamped during the silence of the ensuing night."Book 28,Chapter 16,"The troops in the outposts having brought word, as soon as it waslight, that the enemy had departed, Scipio, despatching his cavalryin advance, ordered the army to move forward; and so rapidly were theyled, that had they directly followed the track of the fugitives, theywould certainly have overtaken them; but they trusted to the report oftheir guides, that there was a shorter cut to the river Baetis, wherethey might attack them while crossing it. Hasdrubal, being precludedfrom passing the river, turned his course to the ocean; and they nowadvanced in disorder and in the manner of fugitives, so that the Romanlegions were left considerably behind. The cavalry and light-armed,attacking sometimes their rear, and sometimes their flank, harassedand delayed them; and as they were obliged to halt, in consequence ofthese frequent annoyances, and engaged sometimes the cavalry, at othertimes the skirmishers and the auxiliary infantry, the legions came up.After this it was no longer a fight, but a butchering as of cattle,till the general himself, who was the first to run away, made hisescape to the neighbouring hills with about six thousand men halfarmed; the rest were slain or made prisoners. The Carthaginianshastily fortified an irregular camp on the highest eminence, and fromthence they defended themselves without difficulty, the enemy failingin his attempt to get at them, from the difficulty of the ascent. Buta siege in a place bare and affording no means of subsistence, washardly to be supported, even for a few days; the troops thereforedeserted to the enemy. At last the general himself, having procuredsome ships, for the sea was not at a great distance, left his army bynight and effected his escape to Gades. Scipio, having heard of theflight of the general of the enemy, left ten thousand foot and onethousand cavalry for Silanus to carry on the siege of the camp, andreturned to Tarraco with the rest of the troops, after a march ofseventy days, during which he took cognizance of the causes of thepetty princes and states, in order that rewards might be conferredaccording to a just estimate of their merits. After his departure,Masinissa, having held a private conference with Silanus, passedover into Africa with a few of his countrymen, in order that he mightinduce his nation also to acquiesce in his new designs. The cause ofthis sudden change was not so evident at the time, as the proof wasconvincing which was afforded by his subsequent fidelity, preservedto extreme old age, that he did not on this occasion act withoutreasonable grounds. Mago went to Gades in the ships which had beensent back by Hasdrubal. Of the rest of the troops thus abandoned bytheir generals, some deserted and others betook themselves to flight,and in this manner were dispersed through the neighbouring states.There was no body of them considerable either for numbers or strength.Such were, as near as possible, the circumstances under which theCarthaginians were driven out of Spain, under the conduct and auspicesof Publius Scipio, in the thirteenth year from the commencement ofthe war, and the fifth from the time that Publius Scipio received theprovince and the army. Not long after, Silanus returned to Tarraco toScipio, with information that the war was at an end."Book 28,Chapter 17,"Lucius Scipio was sent to Rome to convey the news of the reductionof Spain, and with him a number of distinguished captives. Whileeverybody else extolled this achievement as an event in the highestdegree joyful and glorious, yet the author of it alone, whose valourwas such that he never thought he had achieved enough, and whosesearch for true glory was insatiable, considered the reduction ofSpain as affording but a faint idea of the hopes which his aspiringmind had conceived. He now directed his view to Africa and GreatCarthage, and the glorious termination of the war, as redounding tohis honour, and giving lustre to his name. Judging it therefore tobe now necessary to pave the way to his object, and to conciliatethe friendship of kings and nations, he resolved first to sound thedisposition of Syphax, king of the Masaesylians, a nation borderingon the Moors, and lying for the most part over-against that quarter ofSpain in which New Carthage is situated. The king was at the presentjuncture in league with the Carthaginians; and Scipio, concluding thathe would not hold it as more binding and sacred than was customarywith barbarians, sent Caius Laelius as envoy to him with presents. Thebarbarian, delighted with these, and seeing that the Roman cause wasthen successful in every quarter, but that the Carthaginians wereunfortunate in Italy, and no longer existed in Spain, consented toaccept the friendship of the Romans, but refused to give or receivea solemn ratification of it except the Roman general himself werepresent in person. This being the case, Laelius returned to Scipio,having received from the king merely an assurance of a safe journey.To one desirous of getting a footing in Africa, Syphax was of greatimportance, as he was the most powerful king in that country, hadalready had experience of the Carthaginians themselves in war, andthe boundaries of his dominions lay very conveniently with respectto Spain, from which they are separated by a narrow strait. Scipio,therefore, considering it an object of sufficient importance towarrant his attempting it, notwithstanding the greatness of the dangerwhich attended it, since he could not effect it otherwise, left forthe protection of Spain Lucius Marcius at Tarraco, and Marcus Silanusat New Carthage, to which place he had gone on foot by long marches;and setting out himself in company with Caius Laelius, with twoquinqueremes from Carthage, passed over into Africa, working thevessels with oars for the greatest part of the voyage, in consequenceof the calmness of the sea, though sometimes they were assisted bya gentle breeze. It so happened, that just at that time Hasdrubal,having been driven out of Spain, had entered the harbour with seventriremes, and having cast anchor was mooring his ships. The sight oftwo quinqueremes, which it was the firm opinion of everybody belongedto the enemy, and might be overpowered by superior numbers beforethey entered the harbour, produced no other effect than a tumultand confusion among the soldiers and sailors, who endeavoured to nopurpose to get their arms and ships ready; for their sails, impelledby a somewhat brisker gale from the sea, brought the quinqueremes intothe harbour before the Carthaginians weighed their anchors, and no onedared make any further stir now that they were in the king's harbour.Thus Hasdrubal, who landed first, and Scipio and Laelius, who landedsoon after, proceeded to the king."Book 28,Chapter 18,"Syphax considered it highly honourable to him, as it really was,that generals of the two most powerful people of the age should cometo him on the same day to solicit peace and friendship with him. Heinvited them both to become his guests; and, as it was the will offortune that they should be under one roof, and under the protectionof the same household gods, he endeavoured to bring them together toa conference, in order to put an end to the difference between them;when Scipio declared, that there was no personal enmity between theCarthaginian and himself which he might do away with by a conference,and that he could not transact any business relating to the republicwith an enemy without the command of the senate. But the kingbeing earnest in his endeavours to persuade him to come to the sameentertainment, lest one of his guests should appear to be excluded, hedid not withhold his assent. They supped together at the king's table,and Scipio and Hasdrubal even sat at meat on the same couch, becauseit was the king's pleasure. So courteous was the manner of Scipio, sonaturally happy and universal was his genius, that by his conversationhe gained the esteem not only of Syphax, a barbarian, and unused toRoman manners, but even of a most inveterate enemy, who openly avowed,that ""he appeared to him more to be admired for the qualities hedisplayed on a personal interview with him, than for his exploits inwar, and that he had no doubt that Syphax and his kingdom were alreadyat the disposal of the Romans, such were the abilities that manpossessed for gaining the esteem of others. That it, therefore, wasincumbent upon the Carthaginians not more to inquire by what meansthey had lost Spain, than to consider how they might retain possessionof Africa. That it was not from a desire to visit foreign countries,or to roam about delightful coasts, that so great a Roman captain,leaving a recently subdued province, and his armies, had crossed overinto Africa with only two ships, entering an enemy's territory, andcommitting himself to the untried honour of the king, but in pursuanceof a hope he had conceived of subduing Africa. That it had been longthe object of his anxious solicitude, and had drawn from him openexpressions of his indignation, that Scipio was not carrying on warin Africa in the same way as Hannibal was in Italy."" Scipio, havingformed a league with Syphax, set out from Africa, and, after havingbeen tossed about during his voyage by variable and generallytempestuous winds, made the port of New Carthage on the fourth day."Book 28,Chapter 19,"As Spain was undisturbed by a Carthaginian war, so it was evidentthat some of the states remained quiet more from fear, arising froma consciousness of demerit, than from sincere attachment. The mostremarkable of them, both for their greatness and guilt, were Illiturgiand Castulo. Castulo had been in alliance with the Romans whenin prosperity, but had revolted to the Carthaginians after thedestruction of the Scipios and their armies. The Illiturgians, bybetraying and putting to death those who fled thither after thatcalamity, had added villany to revolt. It would have been moredeserved than expedient to have executed severe vengeance upon thesepeople on his first arrival, while the affairs of Spain were in anuncertain state; but now, when all was tranquil, as the time forvisiting them with punishment appeared to have arrived, he summonedLucius Marcius from Tarraco, and sent him with a third of his forcesto attack Castulo, and with the rest of the army he himself reachedIlliturgi, after about five days' march. The gates were closed, andevery arrangement and preparation made for repelling an attack; socompletely had the consciousness of what they deserved producedthe same effect as a declaration of war against them. From thiscircumstance Scipio commenced his exhortation to his soldiers: hesaid, that ""by closing their gates the Spaniards had themselves shownwhat their deserts were by what they feared, and that therefore theyought to prosecute the war against them with much greater animositythan against the Carthaginians. For with the latter the contestwas carried on for empire and glory almost without any exasperatedfeeling, while they had to punish the former for perfidy, cruelty, andvillany. That the time had now arrived when they should take vengeancefor the horrid massacre of their fellow soldiers, and for thetreachery which was prepared for themselves, had they been carried intheir flight to the same place; and by the severity of the punishmentinflicted in the present instance, establish it as a law for ever,that no one should consider a Roman citizen and soldier, whatever hissituation, a fit object for injurious treatment."" Animated by thisexhortation of their general, they distributed the scaling-ladders tomen selected from each of the companies; and the army being dividedinto two parts, so that Laelius, as lieutenant-general, might commandone, they attacked the city in two places at once; thus creating analarm in two quarters at the same time. It was not by the exhortationsof one general, nor of the several nobles who were present, that thetownsmen were stimulated to a vigorous defence of the city, but bythe fear which they themselves entertained; they bore in mind, andadmonished each other, that the object aimed at was punishment, andnot victory. That the only question for them was, where they shouldmeet death, whether in the battle and in the field, where theindiscriminate chance of war frequently raised up the vanquished anddashed the victor to the ground; or whether, after a short interval,when the city was burnt and plundered, after suffering every horrorand indignity, they should expire amid stripes and bonds before theeyes of their captive wives and children. Therefore, not only thosewho were of an age to bear arms, or men only, but women and children,beyond the powers of their minds and bodies, were there, supplyingwith weapons those who were fighting in defence of the place, andcarrying stones to the walls for those who were strengthening theworks; for not only was their liberty at stake, which excites theenergies of the brave only, but they had before their eyes the utmostextremity of punishment, to be inflicted on all indiscriminately, andan ignominious death. Their minds were worked up to the highest pitch,both by emulation in toil and danger, and also by the mere sight ofeach other. Accordingly the contest was entered upon with such ardour,that the army which had subdued the whole of Spain was frequentlydriven back from the walls of one town, and exhibited such a wantof resolution in the contest as was not very honourable to it. WhenScipio perceived this, he was afraid lest, by the failure of hisattempts, the courage of the enemy should be raised and his own troopsbe dispirited; and thinking it incumbent upon him to exert himselfin person and share the danger, reproved his soldiers for theircowardice, and ordered the scaling-ladders to be brought, threateningto mount the wall himself, since the rest hesitated. He had nowadvanced near the walls with no small danger, when a shout was raisedfrom all sides by the soldiers, who were alarmed at the danger theirgeneral was exposed to, and the scaling-ladders began to be reared inseveral places at once. Laelius too, in another quarter, pressed onvigorously. It was then that the energy of the townsmen was subdued,and those who defended the walls being beaten off, the Romans tookpossession of them. The citadel also was captured during the confusionon a side where it was thought impregnable."Book 28,Chapter 20,"Some African deserters, who were at that time among the Romanauxiliaries, while the townsmen were occupied in defending thosequarters whence danger was apprehended, and the Romans were makingapproaches where they could gain access, observed that the mostelevated part of the town, which was protected by a very high rock,was neither fortified by any work nor furnished with defenders. Beingmen of light make and nimble from being well exercised, they climbedup wherever they could gain access over the irregular projections ofthe rock, carrying with them iron spikes. If in any part they met witha cliff too steep and smooth, they fixed spikes at moderate intervals,and having thus formed a sort of steps, and those who were foremostpulling up those who followed, and those who were behind lifting upthose before them, they succeeded in gaining the summit, whence theyran down with a shout into the city, which had already been taken bythe Romans. Then it became manifest indeed that it was resentment andhatred which prompted the assault upon the city. No one thought oftaking any alive, nor of booty, though every thing lay exposed toplunder. They butchered all indiscriminately, armed and unarmed,male and female. Their cruel resentment extended to the slaughter ofinfants. They then set fire to the houses, and pulled down those whichcould not be consumed by fire, so bent were they upon erasing evenevery vestige of the city, and blotting out the memory of theirenemies. Scipio marched his army thence to Castulo, which wasdefended, not only by Spaniards who had assembled there, but also bythe remains of the Carthaginian army, which had gone there from thevarious places to which they had been dispersed in their flight. Butthe news of the calamity of the Illiturgians had reached thembefore the arrival of Scipio; and in consequence of this, dismayand desperation had seized them; and as their cases were differentlycircumstanced, and each party was desirous of consulting its ownsafety independent of the other, at first secret jealousy, and thenan open rupture, created a separation between the Carthaginiansand Spaniards. Cerdubellus without disguise advised the latter tosurrender. Himilco commanded the Carthaginian auxiliaries, which,together with the city, Cerdubellus delivered up to the Romans, havingsecretly obtained terms. This victory was attended with less cruelty;for not only was the guilt of this people less than the others, buttheir voluntary surrender had considerably mitigated resentment."Book 28,Chapter 21,"Marcius was then sent against the barbarians, to reduce under theauthority and dominion of the Romans such of them as had not yet beensubdued. Scipio returned to Carthage, to pay his vows to the gods, andto exhibit a gladiatorial show, which he had prepared on account ofthe death of his father and uncle. This exhibition of gladiatorswas not formed from that description of men which the lanistae areaccustomed to procure, such as slaves, or those who sell their blood.All the service of the combatants was voluntary and gratuitous; forsome were sent by the petty princes, to show an example of the naturalcourage of their people; others came forward to fight, in complimentto their general; others were induced to give and accept challenges,by a spirit of emulation and a desire of victory. Some decided bythe sword disputes which they either could not or were unwilling todetermine by argument, with an agreement that the matter in questionshould be given up to the victor. Nor was it confined to men ofobscure rank, but comprehended persons of distinction and celebrity;such were Corbis and Orsua, cousins-german, who, having a disputeabout the sovereignty of a city called Ibis, declared that they wouldcontest it with the sword. Corbis was the elder of the two. The fatherof Orsua was the last sovereign, having succeeded to that dignity onthe death of his elder brother. When Scipio was desirous of settlingthe dispute by argument and allaying their irritation, they bothdeclared that they had refused that to their mutual kinsmen, and thatthey would appeal to no other judge, whether god or man, than Mars.The elder presuming upon his strength, the younger on the prime ofyouth, each wished to die in the combat rather than become the subjectof the other; and every effort failing to prevent their prosecutingtheir mad design, they exhibited to the army a most interestingspectacle, and a proof how great mischief is occasioned among men by athirst for power. The elder, in consequence of his experience inarms and his address, easily mastered the unscientific efforts ofthe younger. To this show of gladiators were added funeral games,proportioned to the means possessed, and with such magnificence as theprovinces and the camp afforded."Book 28,Chapter 22,"Meanwhile the operations of the war were carried on with unabatedactivity by the lieutenant-generals. Marcius, crossing the riverBaetis, which the natives call Certis, received the submission of twopowerful cities without a contest. There was a city called Astapa,which had always sided with the Carthaginians; nor was it that whichdrew upon it the resentment of the Romans so much as the fact, thatits inhabitants harboured an extraordinary animosity against them,which was not called for by the necessities of the war. Their citywas not so secured by nature or art as to make their dispositions sofierce, but the natural disposition of the inhabitants, which tookdelight in plunder, had induced them to make excursions into theneighbouring lands belonging to the allies of the Romans, and tointercept such Roman soldiers, suttlers, and merchants as they foundranging about. They had also surrounded, by means of an ambuscade, andput to the sword on disadvantageous ground, a large company which wascrossing their borders, for it had proved hardly safe to go in smallparties. When the troops were marched up to assault this city, theinhabitants, conscious of their guilt, and seeing that it would bedangerous to surrender to an enemy so highly incensed, and that theycould not hope to keep themselves in safety by means of their walls ortheir arms, resolved to execute upon themselves and those belongingto them a horrid and inhuman deed. They fixed upon a place in theirforum, in which they collected the most valuable of their property,and having directed their wives and children to seat themselvesupon this heap, they raised a pile of wood around it and threw on itbundles of twigs. They then ordered fifty armed youths to stand thereand guard their fortunes, and the persons dearer to them than theirfortunes, as long as the issue of the battle continued doubtful. Ifthey should perceive that the battle went against them, and thatit came to the point that the city must be captured, they might beassured that those whom they saw going out to engage the enemy wouldperish in the battle itself; but implored them by all the gods,celestial and infernal, that, mindful of their liberty, which must beterminated on that day either by an honourable death or ignominiousservitude, they would leave nothing on which an exasperated enemycould wreak his fury; that they had fire and sword at their command,and it was better that friendly and faithful hands should destroywhat must necessarily perish, than that enemies should insult it withhaughty wantonness. To these exhortations a dreadful execration wasadded against any one who should be diverted from this purpose by hopeor faint-heartedness. Then throwing open the gates, they rushed out ata rapid pace and with the utmost impetuosity. Nor was there any guardsufficiently strong opposed to them; for there could be nothing thatwas less apprehended than that they would have the courage to sallyfrom their walls. A very few troops of horse, and the light-armed,hastily sent out of the camp for that purpose, opposed them. Thebattle was furious and spirited, rather than steady and regular in anydegree. The horse, therefore, which had first encountered the enemy,being repulsed, created an alarm among the light-armed; and the battlewould have been fought under the very rampart, had not the legions,which were their main strength, drawn out their line, though they hada very short time to form in. These too, for a short time, waveredaround their standards, when the Astapans, blind with rage, rushedupon wounds and the sword with reckless daring; but afterwards theveteran soldiers, standing firm against their furious assaults,checked the violence of those that followed by the slaughter of theforemost. Soon after, the veteran troops themselves made an attempt tocharge them, but seeing that not a man gave ground, and that they wereinflexibly determined on dying each in his place, they extended theirline, which the number of their troops enabled them to do with ease,and, surrounding their flanks, slew them all to a man while fightingin a circle."Book 28,Chapter 23,"But these, however, were acts committed by exasperated enemies inthe heat of battle, and executed, in conformity with the laws of war,upon men armed and most fiercely resisting; there was another morehorrible carnage in the city, where a harmless and defenceless crowdof women and children were butchered by their own countrymen, whothrew their bodies, most of them still alive, upon the burning pilewhile streams of blood damped the rising flame; and lastly, weariedwith the piteous slaughter of their friends, they threw themselves,arms and all, into the midst of the flames. When the carnage was nowcompleted the victorious Romans came up, and at the first sight of sorevolting a transaction they stood for some time wrapt in wonderand amazement; but afterwards, from a rapacity natural to humanity,wishing to snatch out of the fire the gold and silver which glitteredamid the heap of other materials, some were caught by the flames,others scorched by the hot blasts, as the foremost were unable toretreat, in consequence of the immense crowd which pressed upon them.In this manner was Astapa destroyed by the sword and fire, withoutaffording any booty to the soldiers. After the rest of the people inthat quarter, influenced by fear, had made submission to him, Marciusled his victorious troops to Scipio, at Carthage. Just at this sametime deserters arrived from Gades, who promised to betray the town andCarthaginian garrison which occupied it, together with the commanderand the fleet. Mago had halted there after his flight, and havingcollected some ships on the ocean, had got together a considerablenumber of auxiliaries from the coast of Africa, on the other side thestrait, and also by means of Hanno the prefect from the neighbouringparts of Spain. After pledges had been exchanged with the deserters,Marcius and Laelius were sent thither, the former with the lightcohorts, the latter with seven triremes and one quinquereme, in orderthat they might act in concert by land and sea."Book 28,Chapter 24,"In consequence of Scipio's being afflicted with a severe fit ofillness, which rumour represented as more serious than it really was;for every one made some addition to the account he had received, froma desire inherent in mankind of intentionally exaggerating reports,the whole province, and more especially the distant parts of it, werethrown into a state of ferment; and it was evident what a seriousdisturbance would have been excited had he really died, when anunfounded report created such violent commotions. Neither theallies kept their allegiance, nor the army their duty. Mandonius andIndibilis, who were not at all satisfied with what had occurred, forthey had anticipated with certainty that they would have the dominionof Spain on the expulsion of the Carthaginians, called together theircountrymen the Lacetani, and summoning the Celtiberian youth to arms,devastated in a hostile manner the territories of the Suessetaniansand Sedetanians, allies of the Romans. Besides, a mutiny arose in thecamp at Sucro. Here were eight thousand men, stationed as a guard overthe nations dwelling on this side the Iberus. It was not on hearinguncertain rumours respecting the life of the general that their mindswere first excited, but previously, owing to the licentiousness whichnaturally results from long-continued idleness, and in some degreealso owing to the restraint felt in time of peace by men who had beenaccustomed to live freely on what they gained by plunder in an enemy'scountry. At first they only discoursed in private, asking what theywere doing among people who were at peace with them, if there wasa war in the province? if the war was terminated and the provincecompletely subdued, why were they not conveyed back into Italy?The pay also was demanded with more insolence than was customary orconsistent with military subordination, and the guards cast reproachesupon the tribunes while going round to the watches. Some too had goneout by night into the neighbouring lands, belonging to persons atpeace with the Romans, to plunder; but at last they quitted theirstandards in the day-time and openly without furloughs. Every thingwas done according to the caprice and unrestrained will of thesoldiers, and nothing according to rule and military discipline, orthe orders of those who were in command. The form, however, of a Romancamp was preserved solely in consequence of the hopes they entertainedthat the tribunes, catching the spirit of insubordination, wouldnot be averse from taking part in the mutiny and defection, on whichaccount they suffered them to dispense justice in their courts, wentto them for the watch-word, and served in their turn on the outpostsand watches; and as they had taken away the power of command, so theypreserved the appearance of obedience to orders, by spontaneouslyexecuting their own. Afterwards, when they perceived that the tribunescensured and reprobated their proceedings, endeavoured to counteractthem, and publicly declared that they would not take any share intheir disorderly conduct, the mutiny assumed a decided character;when, after driving the tribunes from their courts, and shortly afterfrom the camp, the command was conferred by universal consent uponCaius Albius of Cales and Caius Atrius of Umbria, common soldiers,who were the prime movers of the sedition. These men were so far frombeing satisfied with the ornaments used by tribunes, that they had theaudacity to lay hold even of the insignia of the highest authority,the fasces and axes, without ever reflecting that their own backs andnecks were in danger from those very rods and axes which they carriedbefore them to intimidate others. Their mistaken belief of the deathof Scipio had blinded their minds, and they doubted not that, in ashort time, when that event should be made generally known, allSpain would blaze with war; that during this confusion money mightbe exacted from the allies and the neighbouring cities plundered; andthat in this unsettled state of affairs, when there was nothing whichany man would not dare, their own acts would be less conspicuous."Book 28,Chapter 25,"As they expected that other fresh accounts would follow thosewhich they had received, not only of the death, but even of theburial, of Scipio, and yet none arrived; and as the rumour which hadbeen so idly originated began to die away, the first author of itbegan to be sought out; and each backing out in order that he mightappear rather to have inconsiderately credited than to have fabricatedsuch a report, the leaders were forsaken, and began now to dread theirown ensigns of authority, and to apprehend that, instead of that emptyshow of command which they wore, a legitimate and rightful power wouldbe turned against them. The mutiny being thus paralysed, and crediblepersons bringing in accounts, first, that Scipio was alive, and, soonafter, that he was even in good health, seven military tribunes weresent by Scipio himself. At the first arrival of these their minds wereviolently excited; but they were soon calmed by the mild and soothinglanguage which they addressed to such of their acquaintance asthey met with; for, going round first of all to the tents, and thenentering the principia and the praetorium, wherever they observedcircles of men conversing together, they addressed them, inquiringrather what it was that had occasioned their displeasure and suddenconsternation, than taxing them with what had occurred. ""That theyhad not received their pay at the appointed time,"" was generallycomplained; and ""that although at the time of the horrid transactionof the Illiturgians, and after the destruction of two generals and twoarmies, the Roman cause had been defended and the province retainedby their valour; the Illiturgians had received the punishment due totheir offence, but there was no one found to reward them for theirmeritorious services."" The tribunes replied, ""that, considering thenature of their complaints, what they requested was just, and thatthey would lay it before the general; that they were happy that therewas nothing of a more gloomy and irremediable character; that bothPublius Scipio, by the favour of the gods, and the commonwealth, werein a situation to requite them."" Scipio, who was accustomed to warbut inexperienced in the storms of sedition, felt great anxiety on theoccasion, lest the army should run into excess in transgressing, orhimself in punishing. For the present he resolved to persist inthe lenient line of conduct with which he had begun, and sendingcollectors round to the tributary states, to give the soldiers hopesof soon receiving their pay. Immediately after this a proclamation wasissued that they should come to Carthage to receive their pay, whetherthey wished to do so in detached parties or all in a body. The suddensuppression of the rebellion among the Spaniards had the effect oftranquillizing the mutiny, which was by this time beginning to subsideof itself; for Mandonius and Indibilis, relinquishing their attempt,had returned within their borders when intelligence was broughtthat Scipio was alive; nor did there now remain any person, whethercountryman or foreigner, whom they could make their companion intheir desperate enterprise. On examining every method, they had noalternative except that which afforded a retreat from wicked designs,which was not of the safest kind, namely, to commit themselves eitherto the just anger of the general, or to his clemency, of whichthey need not despair. For he had pardoned even enemies whom he hadencountered with the sword; while they reflected that their seditionhad been unaccompanied with wounds or blood, and was neither in itselfof an atrocious character nor merited severe punishment. So natural isit for men to be over-eloquent in extenuating their own demerit. Theyfelt doubtful whether they should go to demand their pay in singlecohorts or in one entire body; but the opinion that they should go ina body, which they regarded as the safer mode, prevailed."Book 28,Chapter 26,"At the same time, when they were employed in these deliberations,a council was held on their case at Carthage; when a warm debate tookplace as to whether they should visit with punishment the originatorsonly of the mutiny, who were in number not more than thirty-five, or,whether atonement should be made for this defection, (for such it wasrather than a mutiny,) of so dreadful a character as a precedent, bythe punishment of a greater number. The opinion recommending themore lenient course, that the punishment should fall where the guiltoriginated, was adopted. For the multitude a reprimand was consideredsufficient. On the breaking up of the council, orders were given tothe army, which was in Carthage, to prepare for an expedition againstMandonius and Indibilis, and to get ready provisions for several days,in order that they might appear to have been deliberating about this.The seven tribunes who had before gone to Sucro to quell the mutiny,having been sent out to meet the army, gave in, each of them, fivenames of persons principally concerned in the affair, in order thatproper persons might be employed to invite them to their homes, withsmiles and kind words; and that, when overpowered with wine, theymight be thrown into chains. They were not far distant from Carthagewhen the intelligence, received from persons on the road, that thewhole army was going the following day with Marcus Silanus againstthe Lacetanians, not only freed them from all the apprehensions which,though they did not give utterance to them, sat heavy upon theirminds, but occasioned the greatest transport, because they wouldthus have the general alone, and in their power, instead of beingthemselves in his. They entered the city just at sun-set, and saw theother army making every preparation for a march. Immediately on theirarrival they were greeted in terms feigned for the purpose, thattheir arrival was looked upon by the general as a happy and seasonablecircumstance, for they had come when the other army was just onthe point of setting out. After which they proceeded to refreshthemselves. The authors of the mutiny, having been conveyed to theirlodgings by proper persons, were apprehended by the tribunes withoutany disturbance, and thrown into chains. At the fourth watch thebaggage belonging to the army, which, as it was pretended, wasabout to march, began to set out. As soon as it was light the troopsmarched, but were stopped at the gate, and guards were sent round toall the gates to prevent any one going out of the city. Then those whohad arrived the day before, having been summoned to an assembly, ranin crowds into the forum to the tribunal of the general, with thepresumptuous purpose of intimidating him by their shouts. At the sametime that the general mounted the tribunal, the armed troops, whichhad been brought back from the gates, spread themselves around therear of the unarmed assembly. Then all their insolence subsided; and,as they afterwards confessed, nothing terrified them so much as theunexpected vigour and hue of the general, whom they had supposed theyshould see in a sickly state, and his countenance, which was such asthey declared that they did not remember to have ever seen it even inbattle. He sat silent for a short time till he was informed that theinstigators of the mutiny were brought into the forum, and that everything was now in readiness."Book 28,Chapter 27,"Then, a herald having obtained silence, he thus began: ""I imaginedthat language would never fail me in which to address my army; notthat I have ever accustomed myself to speaking rather than action,but because, having been kept in a camp almost from my boyhood, I hadbecome familiar with the dispositions of soldiers. But I am at a lossboth for sentiments and expressions with which to address you, whom Iknow not even by what name I ought to call. Can I call you countrymen,who have revolted from your country? or soldiers, who have rejectedthe command and authority of your general, and violated the solemnobligation of your oath? Can I call you enemies? I recognise thepersons, faces, dress, and mien of fellow countrymen; but I perceivethe actions, expressions, intentions, and feelings of enemies. Forwhat have you wished and hoped for, but what the Ilergetians andLacetanians did. Yet they followed Mandonius and Indibilis, men ofroyal rank, who were the leaders of their mad project; you conferredthe auspices and command upon the Umbrian, Atrius, and the Calenian,Albius. Deny, soldiers, that you were all concerned in this measure,or that you approved of it when taken. I shall willingly believe, whenyou disclaim it, that it was the folly and madness of a few. For theacts which have been committed are of such a nature, that, if thewhole army participated in them, they could not be expiated withoutatonements of tremendous magnitude. Upon these points, like wounds, Itouch with reluctance; but unless touched and handled, they cannot becured. For my own part, I believed that, after the Carthaginianswere expelled from Spain, there was not a place in the whole provincewhere, or any persons to whom, my life was obnoxious; such was themanner in which I had conducted myself, not only towards my allies,but even towards my enemies. But lo, even in my own camp, so much wasI deceived in my opinion, the report of my death was not only readilybelieved, but anxiously waited for. Not that I wish to implicate youall in this enormity; for, be assured, if I supposed that the whole ofmy army desired my death, I would here immediately expire before youreyes; nor could I take any pleasure in a life which was odious to mycountrymen and my soldiers. But every multitude is in its nature likethe ocean; which, though in itself incapable of motion, is excited bystorms and winds. So, also, in yourselves there is calm and there arestorms; but the cause and origin of your fury is entirely attributableto those who led you on; you have caught your madness by contagion.Nay, even this day you do not appear to me to be aware to what a pitchof phrensy you have proceeded; what a heinous crime you have daredto commit against myself, your country, your parents, your children;against the gods, the witnesses of your oath; against the auspicesunder which you serve; against the laws of war, the discipline of yourancestors, and the majesty of the highest authority. With regard tomyself, I say nothing. You may have believed the report of my deathrather inconsiderately than eagerly. Lastly, suppose me to be such aman that it could not at all be a matter of astonishment that my armyshould be weary of my command, yet what had your country deservedof you, which you betrayed by making common cause with Mandonius andIndibilis? What the Roman people, when, taking the command from thetribunes appointed by their suffrages, you conferred it on privatemen? When, not content even with having them for tribunes, you, aRoman army, conferred the fasces of your general upon men who neverhad a slave under their command? Albius and Atrius had their tents inyour general's pavilion. With them the trumpet sounded, from them theword was taken, they sat upon the tribunal of Scipio, upon whom thelictor attended, for them the crowd was cleared away as they movedalong, before them the fasces with the axes were carried. When showersof stones descend, lightnings are darted from the heavens, and animalsgive birth to monsters, you consider these things as prodigies. Thisis a prodigy which can be expiated by no victims, by no supplications,without the blood of those men who have dared to commit so great acrime."Book 28,Chapter 28,"""Now, though villany is never guided by reason, yet so far as itcould exist in so nefarious a transaction, I would fain know what wasyour design. Formerly, a legion which was sent to garrison Rhegium,wickedly put to the sword the principal inhabitants and keptpossession of that opulent city through a space of ten years; onaccount of which enormity the entire legion, consisting of fourthousand men, were beheaded in the forum at Rome. But they, in thefirst place, did not put themselves under the direction of Atrius theUmbrian, scarcely superior to a scullion, whose name even was ominous,but of Decius Jubellius, a military tribune; nor did they unitethemselves with Pyrrhus, or with the Samnites or Lucanians, theenemies of the Roman people. But you made common cause with Mandoniusand Indibilis, and intended also to have united your arms with them.They intended to have held Rhegium as a lasting settlement, asthe Campanians held Capua, which they took from its ancient Tuscaninhabitants; and as the Mamertines held Messana in Sicily, without anydesign of commencing without provocation a war upon the Roman peopleor their allies. Was it your purpose to hold Sucro as a place ofabode? where, had I, your general, left you on my departure after thereduction of the province, you would have been justified in imploringthe interference of gods and men, because you could not return to yourwives and children. But suppose that you banished from your minds allrecollection of these, as you did of your country and myself; I wouldwish to track the course of a wicked design, but not of one utterlyinsane. While I was alive, and the rest of the army safe, with whichin one day I took Carthage, with which I routed, put to flight,and expelled from Spain four generals and four armies of theCarthaginians; did you, I say, who were only eight thousand men, allof course of less worth than Albius and Atrius, to whom you subjectedyourselves, hope to wrest the province of Spain out of the hands ofthe Roman people? I lay no stress upon my own name, I put it out ofthe question. Let it be supposed that I have not been injured by youin any respect beyond the ready credence of my death. What! if I weredead, was the state to expire with me? was the empire of the Romanpeople to fall with me? Jupiter, most good and great, would not havepermitted that the existence of the city, built under the auspices andsanction of the gods to last for ever, should terminate with that ofthis frail and perishable body. The Roman people have survived thosemany and distinguished generals who were all cut off in one war;Flaminius, Paulus, Gracchus, Posthumius Albinus, Marcus Marcellus,Titus Quinctius Crispinus, Cneius Fulvius, my kinsmen the Scipios;and will survive a thousand others who may perish, some by the sword,others by disease; and would the Roman state have been buried with mysingle corpse? You yourselves, here in Spain, when your two generals,my father and my uncle, fell, chose Septimus Marcius as your generalto oppose the Carthaginians, exulting on account of their recentvictory. And thus I speak, on the supposition that Spain would havebeen without a leader. Would Marcus Silanus, who was sent into theprovince with the same power and the same command as myself, wouldLucius Scipio my brother, and Caius Laelius, lieutenant-generals, havebeen wanting to avenge the majesty of the empire? Could the armies,the generals themselves, their dignity or their cause, be comparedwith one another? And even had you got the better of all these, wouldyou bear arms in conjunction with the Carthaginians against yourcountry, against your countrymen? Would you wish that Africa shouldrule Italy, and Carthage the city of Rome? If so, for what offence onthe part of your country?"Book 28,Chapter 29,"""An unjust sentence of condemnation, and a miserable andundeserved banishment, formerly induced Coriolanus to go and fightagainst his country; he was restrained, however, by private duty frompublic parricide. What grief, what resentment instigated you? Was thedelay of your pay for a few days, during the illness of your general,a reason of sufficient weight for you to declare war against yourcountry? to revolt from the Roman people and join the Ilergetians?to leave no obligation, divine or human, unviolated? Without doubt,soldiers, you were mad; nor was the disease which seized my frame moreviolent than that with which your minds were affected. I shrink withhorror from the relation of what men believed, what they hoped andwished. Let oblivion cover all these things if possible; if not,however it be, let them be covered in silence. I must confess myspeech must have appeared to you severe and harsh, but how much moreharsh, think you, must your actions be than my words! Do you think itreasonable that I should suffer all the acts which you have committed,and that you should not bear with patience even to hear themmentioned? But you shall not be reproached even with these things anyfurther. I could wish that you might as easily forget them as I shall.Therefore, as far as relates to the general body of you, if you repentof the error you have committed, I shall have received sufficient andmore than sufficient atonement for it. Albius the Calenian, and Atriusthe Umbrian, with the rest of the principal movers of thisimpious mutiny, shall expiate with their blood the crime they haveperpetrated. To yourselves, if you have returned to a sound stateof mind, the sight of their punishment ought not only to be notunpleasant, but even gratifying; for there are no persons to whom themeasures they have taken are more hostile and injurious than toyou."" He had scarcely finished speaking, when, according to the planpreconcerted, every object of terror was at once presented to theireyes and ears. The troops, which had formed a circle round theassembly, clashed their swords against their shields; the herald'svoice was heard citing by name the persons who had been condemned inthe council; the culprits were dragged naked into the midst of theassembly, and at the same time all the apparatus for punishment wasbrought forth. They were tied to the stake, scourged with rods, anddecapitated; while those who were present were so benumbed with fear,that not only no expression of dissatisfaction at the severity of thepunishment, but not even a groan was heard. They were then all draggedout, the place was cleared, and the men cited by name took the oath ofallegiance to Scipio before the military tribunes, each receivinghis full demand of pay as he answered to his name. Such was thetermination and result which the insurrection of the soldiers, whichbegan at Sucro, met with."Book 28,Chapter 30,"During the time of these transactions, Hanno, thelieutenant-general of Mago, having been sent from Gades to the riverBaetis with a small body of Africans, by tempting the Spaniards withmoney, armed as many as four thousand men; but afterwards, beingdeprived of his camp by Lucius Marcius, and losing the principal partof his troops in the confusion occasioned by its capture, and somealso in the flight, for the cavalry pursued them closely while theywere dispersed, he made his escape with a few attendants. During thesetransactions on the river Baetis, Laelius in the mean time, sailingout of the straits into the ocean, came with his fleet before Carteia,a city situated on the coast of the ocean, where the sea beginsto expand itself, after being confined in a narrow strait. He hadentertained hopes of having Gades betrayed to him without a contest,persons having come unsolicited into the Roman camp to make promisesto that effect, as has been before mentioned. The plot was discoveredbefore it was ripe, and all having been apprehended, were placed byMago in the hands of Adherbal the praetor, to be conveyed to Carthage.Adherbal, having put the conspirators on board a quinquereme, sentit in advance, because it sailed slower than a trireme, and followedhimself at a moderate distance with eight triremes. The quinqueremewas just entering the strait, when Laelius, who had himself alsosailed out of the harbour of Carteia in a quinquereme, followed byseven triremes, bore down upon Adherbal and his triremes, feelingassured that the trireme, when once caught in the rapid strait, wouldnot be able to return against the opposing current. The Carthaginian,alarmed by the suddenness of the affair, hesitated for some littletime whether he should follow the trireme, or turn his prows againstthe enemy. This very delay put it out of his power to decline anaction, for they were now within a weapon's cast, and the enemy werebearing down upon him on all sides. The current also had renderedit impossible to manage the ships. Nor was the action like a navalengagement, inasmuch as it was in no respect subject to the controlof the will, nor afforded any opportunity for the exercise of skillor method. The nature of the strait and the tide, which solely andentirely governed the contest, carried the ships against those oftheir own and the enemy's party indiscriminately, though striving ina contrary direction; so that you might see one ship which was flyingwhirled back by an eddy and driven against the victors, and anotherwhich was engaged in pursuit, if it had fallen into an oppositecurrent, turning itself away as if for flight. And when actuallyengaged, one ship while bearing down upon another with its beakdirected against it, assuming an oblique position itself, received astroke from the beak of the other; while another which lay with itsside exposed to the enemy, receiving a sudden impulse, was turnedround so as to present its prow. While the triremes were thus engagedin a doubtful and uncertain contest, in which every thing was governedby chance, the Roman quinquereme, whether being more manageable inconsequence of its weight, or by means of more banks of oars makingits way through the eddies, sunk two triremes, and swept off the oarsfrom one side of another, while sailing by it with great violence.The rest too, had they come in its way, it would have disabled; butAdherbal, with his remaining four ships, sailed over into Africa."Book 28,Chapter 31,"Laelius returned victorious into Carteia; and hearing therewhat had occurred at Gades, that the plot had been discovered, theconspirators sent to Carthage, and that the hopes which had broughtthem there had been completely frustrated, he sent a message toLucius Marcius, to the effect that, unless they wished to waste timeuselessly in lying before Gades, they should return to the general;and Marcius consenting to the proposal, they both returned to Carthagea few days after. In consequence of their departure, Mago not onlyobtained a temporary relief from the dangers which beset him on allsides, both by sea and land, but also on hearing of the rebellionof the Ilergetians, conceived hopes of recovering Spain, and sentmessengers to Carthage to the senate, who, at the same time that theyrepresented to them in exaggerated terms both the intestine dissensionin the Roman camp and the defection of their allies, might exhort themto send succours by which the empire of Spain, which had been handeddown to them by their ancestors, might be regained. Mandonius andIndibilis, retiring within their borders, remained quiet for alittle time, not knowing what course to take, till they knew what wasdetermined upon respecting the mutiny; but not distrusting that ifScipio pardoned the error of his own countrymen, they also mightobtain the same. But when the severe punishment inflicted came tobe generally known, concluding that their offence also would beconsidered as demanding a similar expiation, they again summoned theircountrymen to arms; and assembling the auxiliaries which had joinedthem before, they crossed over into the Sedetanian territory, wherethey had had a fixed camp at the beginning of the revolt, with twentythousand foot and two thousand five hundred horse."Book 28,Chapter 32,"Scipio having without difficulty regained the affection of hissoldiers, both by his punctuality in discharging the arrears of pay toall, as well the guilty as the innocent, and particularly by the looksand language of reconciliation towards all, before he quitted Carthagesummoned an assembly; and after inveighing at large against theperfidy of the petty princes who were in rebellion, declared ""that thefeelings with which he set out to take revenge for their villany werewidely different from those with which he lately corrected the errorcommitted by his countrymen. That on the latter occasion, he had withgroans and tears, as though he were cutting his own vitals, expiatedeither the imprudence or the guilt of eight thousand men with theheads of thirty; but now he was going to the destruction of theIlergetians with joyful and animated feelings: for they were neithernatives of the same soil, nor united with him by any bond of society.The only connexion which did subsist between them, that of honour andfriendship, they had themselves severed by their wicked conduct."" Whenhe looked at the troops which composed his army, besides that he sawthat they were all either of his own country, or allies and of theLatin confederacy; he was also strongly affected by the circumstance,that there was scarcely a soldier in it who was not brought out ofItaly into that country either by his uncle, Cneius Scipio, who wasthe first of the Roman name who had come into that province, or by hisfather when consul, or by himself. That they were all accustomed tothe name and auspices of the Scipios; that it was his wish to takethem home to their country to receive a well-earned triumph; andthat he hoped that they would support him when he put up for theconsulship, as if the honour sought were to be shared in common bythem all. With regard to the expedition which they were just going toundertake, that the man who considered it as a war must be forgetfulof his own achievements. That, by Hercules, Mago, who had fled forsafety with a few ships beyond the limits of the world into an islandsurrounded by the ocean, was a source of greater concern to him thanthe Ilergetians; for in it there was both a Carthaginian general and aCarthaginian army, whatever might be its numbers; while here were onlyrobbers and leaders of robbers, who, though they possessed sufficientenergy for ravaging the lands of their neighbours, burning theirhouses, and carrying off their cattle, yet would have none at all ina regular and pitched battle; and who would come to the encounterrelying more on the swiftness with which they can fly than on theirarms. ""Accordingly,"" he said, ""that he had thought it right to quellthe Ilergetians before he quitted the province, not because he sawthat any danger could arise from them, or that a war of greaterimportance could grow out of these proceedings; but in the firstplace, that a revolt of so heinous a character might not gounpunished, and in the next place, that not a single enemy might besaid to be left in a province which had been subdued with such valourand success. He bid them, therefore, follow him, with the assistanceof the gods, not so much to make war upon, for the contest wasnot with an enemy who was upon an equality with them, but to takevengeance on the basest of men."""Book 28,Chapter 33,"After this harangue he dismissed them, with orders to getthemselves in readiness in every respect for marching the next day;when, setting out, he arrived at the river Iberus in ten days. Thencrossing the river, he, on the fourth day, pitched his camp withinsight of the enemy. Before him was a plain enclosed on all sides bymountains. Into the valley thus formed Scipio ordered some cattle,taken chiefly from the lands of the enemy, to be driven, in order toexcite the rapacity of the barbarians, and then sent some light-armedtroops as a protection for them, directing Laelius to charge the enemyfrom a place of concealment when they were engaged in skirmishing. Amountain which projected conveniently concealed the ambuscade of thecavalry, and the battle began without delay. The Spaniards, as soonas they saw the cattle at a distance, rushed upon them, and thelight-armed troops attacked the Spaniards while occupied with theirbooty. At first they annoyed each other with missiles; but afterwards,having discharged their light weapons, which were calculated toprovoke rather than to decide the contest, they drew their swords,and began to engage foot to foot. The fight between the infantry wouldhave been doubtful, but that the cavalry then came up, and not only,charging them in front, trod down all before them, but some also,riding round by the foot of the hill, presented themselves on theirrear, so that they might intercept the greater part of them; andconsequently the carnage was greater than usually takes place in lightand skirmishing engagements. The resentment of the barbarians wasrather inflamed by this adverse battle, than their spirits depressed.Accordingly, that they might not appear cast down, they marched outinto the field the following day as soon as it was light. The valley,which was confined, as has been before stated, would not contain alltheir forces. About two-thirds of their foot and all their cavalrycame down to the engagement. The remainder of their infantry theystationed on the declivity of the hill. Scipio, conceiving that theconfined nature of the ground would be in his favour, both because theRoman troops were better adapted for fighting in a contracted spacethan the Spanish, and also because the enemy had come down and formedtheir line on ground which would not contain all their forces, appliedhis mind to a new expedient. For he considered that he could nothimself cover his flanks with his cavalry, and that those of the enemywhich they had led out, together with their infantry, would be unableto act. Accordingly he ordered Laelius to lead the cavalry round bythe hills as secretly as possible, and separate, as far as he could,the fight between the cavalry from that between the infantry. Hehimself drew up the whole body of his infantry against the enemy,placing four cohorts in front, because he could not extend his linefurther. He commenced the battle without delay, in order that thecontest itself might divert the attention of the enemy, and preventtheir observing the cavalry which were passing along the hills. Norwere they aware that they had come round before they beard the noiseoccasioned by the engagement of the cavalry in their rear. Thus therewere two battles; two lines of infantry and two bodies of horse beingengaged within the space occupied by the plain lengthwise; and thatbecause it was too narrow to admit of both descriptions of force beingengaged in the same lines. When the Spanish infantry could not assisttheir cavalry, nor their cavalry the infantry, and the infantry, whichhad rashly engaged in the plain, relying on the assistance of thecavalry, were being cut to pieces, the cavalry themselves also, beingsurrounded and unable to stand the shock of the enemy's infantryin front, (for by this time their own infantry were completelyoverthrown,) nor of the cavalry in their rear, after having formedthemselves into a circle and defended themselves for a long time,their horses standing still, were all slain to a man. Nor did oneperson, horse or foot, survive of those who were engaged in thevalley. The third part, which stood upon the hill rather to view thecontest in security than to take any part of it upon themselves, hadboth time and space to fly; among whom the princes themselves alsofled, having escaped during the confusion, before the army wasentirely surrounded."Book 28,Chapter 34,"The same day, besides other booty, the camp of the Spaniards wastaken, together with about three thousand men. Of the Romans and theirallies as many as one thousand two hundred fell in that battle; morethan three thousand were wounded. The victory would have been lessbloody had the battle taken place in a plain more extended, andaffording facilities for flight. Indibilis, renouncing his purposeof carrying on war, and considering that his safest reliance in hispresent distress was on the tried honour and clemency of Scipio, senthis brother Mandonius to him; who, falling prostrate before his knees,ascribed his conduct to the fatal frenzy of those times, when, as itwere from the effects of some pestilential contagion, not only theIlergetians and Lacetanians, but even the Roman camp had been infectedwith madness. He said that his own condition, and that of his brotherand the rest of his countrymen, was such, that either, if it seemedgood, they would give back their lives to him from whom they hadreceived them, or if preserved a second time, they would in return forthat favour devote their lives for ever to the service of him to whomalone they were indebted for them. They before placed their relianceon their cause, when they had not yet had experience of his clemency,but now, on the contrary, placing no reliance on their cause, alltheir hopes were centred in the mercy of the conqueror. It was acustom with the Romans, observed from ancient times, not to exerciseany authority over others, as subject to them, in cases where they didnot enter into friendship with them by a league and on equal terms,until they had surrendered all they possessed, sacred and profane;until they had received hostages, taken their arms from them, andplaced garrisons in their cities. In the present instance, however,Scipio, after inveighing at great length against Mandonius, who stoodbefore him, and Indibilis, who was absent, said ""that they had justlyforfeited their lives by their wicked conduct, but that they shouldbe preserved by the kindness of himself and the Roman people. Further,that he would neither take their arms from them, (which only served aspledges to those who feared rebellion,) but would leave them thefree use of them, and their minds free from fear; nor would he takevengeance on their unoffending hostages, but upon themselves, shouldthey revolt, not inflicting punishment upon a defenceless but an armedenemy. That he gave them the liberty of choosing whether they wouldhave the Romans favourable to them or incensed against them, for theyhad experienced them under both circumstances."" Thus Mandonius wasallowed to depart, having only a pecuniary fine imposed upon him tofurnish the means of paying the troops. Scipio himself, having sentMarcius in advance into the Farther Spain, and sent Silanus back toTarraco, waited a few days until the Ilergetians had paid the fineimposed upon them; and then, setting out with some troops lightlyequipped, overtook Marcius when he was now drawing near to the ocean."Book 28,Chapter 35,"The negotiation which had some time before commenced respectingMasinissa, was delayed from one cause after another; for the Numidianwas desirous by all means of conferring with Scipio in person, and oftouching his right hand in confirmation of their compact. This was thecause of Scipio's undertaking at this time a journey of such a length,and into so remote a quarter. Masinissa, when at Gades, receivedinformation from Marcius of the approach of Scipio, and by pretendingthat his horses were injured by being pent up in the island, and thatthey not only caused a scarcity of every thing to the rest, but alsofelt it themselves; moreover that his cavalry were beginning to losetheir energy for want of employment; he prevailed upon Mago to allowhim to cross over to the continent, to plunder the adjacent countryof Spain. Having passed over, he sent forward three chiefs of theNumidians, to fix a time and place for the conference desiring thattwo might be detained by Scipio as hostages. The third being sent backto conduct Masinissa to the place to which he was directed to bringhim, they came to the conference with a few attendants. The Numidianhad long before been possessed with admiration of Scipio from the fameof his exploits; and his imagination had pictured to him the idea ofa grand and magnificent person; but his veneration for him was stillgreater when he appeared before him. For besides that his person,naturally majestic in the highest degree, was rendered still moreso by his flowing hair, by his dress, which was not in a precise andornamental style, but truly masculine and soldier-like, and also byhis age, for he was then in full vigour of body, to which the bloom ofyouth, renewed as it were after his late illness, had given additionalfulness and sleekness. The Numidian, who was in a manner thunderstruckby the mere effect of the meeting, thanked him for having sent homehis brother's son. He affirmed, that from that time he had sought forthis opportunity, which being at length presented to him, by favour ofthe immortal gods, he had not allowed to pass without seizing it. Thathe desired to serve him and the Roman people in such a manner, as thatno one foreigner should have aided the Roman interest with greaterzeal than himself. Although he had long since wished it, he had notbeen so able to effect it in Spain, a foreign and strange country; butthat it would be easy for him to do so in that country in which he hadbeen born and educated, under the hope of succeeding to his father'sthrone. If, indeed, the Romans should send the same commander, Scipio,into Africa, he entertained a well-grounded hope that Carthage wouldcontinue to exist but a short time. Scipio saw and heard him with thehighest delight, both because he knew that he was the first man in allthe cavalry of the enemy, and because the youth himself exhibited inhis manner the strongest proof of a noble spirit. After mutual pledgesof faith, he set out on his return to Tarraco. Masinissa, having laidwaste the adjacent lands, with the permission of the Romans, that hemight not appear to have passed over into the continent to no purpose,returned to Gades."Book 28,Chapter 36,"Mago, who despaired of success in Spain, of which he hadentertained hopes, from the confidence inspired first by the mutiny ofthe soldiers, and afterwards by the defection of Indibilis, received amessage from Carthage, while preparing to cross over into Africa, thatthe senate ordered him to carry over into Italy the fleet he had atGades; and hiring there as many as he could of the Gallic and Ligurianyouth, to form a junction with Hannibal, and not to suffer the war toflag which had been begun with so much vigour and still more success.For this object Mago not only received a supply of money fromCarthage, but himself also exacted as much as he could from theinhabitants of Gades, plundering not only their treasury, but theirtemples, and compelling them individually to bring contributions ofgold and silver, for the public service. As he sailed along the coastof Spain, he landed his troops not far from New Carthage, and afterwasting the neighbouring lands, brought his fleet thence to the city.Here, keeping his troops in the ships by day, he landed them by night,and marched them to that part of the wall at which Carthage had beencaptured by the Romans; for he had supposed both that the garrisonby which the city was occupied was not sufficiently strong for itsprotection, and that some of the townsmen would act on the hope ofeffecting a change. But messengers who came with the utmost hasteand alarm from the country, brought intelligence at once of thedevastation of the lands, the flight of the rustics, and the approachof the enemy. Besides, the fleet had been observed during the day, andit was evident that there was some object in choosing a station beforethe city. Accordingly, the troops were kept drawn up and armed withinthe gate which looks towards the lake and the sea. When the enemy,rushing forward in a disorderly manner, with a crowd of seamen mingledwith soldiers, came up to the walls with more noise than strength;the gate being suddenly thrown open, the Romans sallied forth with ashout, and pursued the enemy, routed and put to flight at the firstonset and discharge of their weapons, all the way to the shore,killing a great number of them; nor would one of them have survivedthe battle and the flight, had not the ships, which had been broughtto the shore, afforded them a refuge in their dismay. Great alarm andconfusion also prevailed in the ships, occasioned by their drawing upthe ladders, lest the enemy should force their way in together withtheir own men, and by cutting away their halsers and anchors that theymight not lose time in weighing them. Many, too, met with a miserabledeath while endeavouring to swim to the ships, not knowing, inconsequence of the darkness, which way to direct their course, or whatto avoid. On the following day, after the fleet had fled back to theocean whence it had come, as many as eight hundred were slain betweenthe wall and the shore, and two thousand stand of arms were found."Book 28,Chapter 37,"Mago, on his return to Gades, not being allowed to enter theplace, brought his fleet to shore at Cimbis, a place not far distantfrom Gades; whence he sent ambassadors with complaints of their havingclosed their gates upon a friend and ally. While they endeavouredto excuse themselves on the ground that it was done by a disorderlyassembly of their people, who were exasperated against them on accountof some acts of plunder which had been committed by the soldiers whenthey were embarking, he enticed their suffetes, which is the nameof the chief magistracy among the Carthaginians, together withtheir quaestor, to come to a conference; when he ordered them to belacerated with stripes and crucified. He then passed over with hisfleet to the island Pityusa, distant about a hundred miles from thecontinent, and inhabited at that time by Carthaginians; on whichaccount the fleet was received in a friendly manner; and not only wereprovisions liberally furnished, but also young men and arms were giventhem to reinforce their fleet. Rendered confident by these supplies,the Carthaginians crossed over to the Balearian islands, fifty milesdistant. The Balearian islands are two in number; one larger than theother, and more powerful in men and arms; having also a harbour inwhich, as it was now the latter end of autumn, he believed he mightwinter conveniently. But here his fleet was opposed with as muchhostility as he would have met with had the Romans inhabited thatisland. The only weapons they used at that time, and which they nowprincipally employ, were slings; nor is there an individual of anyother nation who possesses such a degree of excellence in the skilfuluse of this weapon, as the Balearians universally possess over therest of the world. Such a quantity of stones, therefore, was pouredlike the thickest hail on the fleet, when approaching the shore, that,not daring to enter the harbour, they made off for the main. Theythen passed over to the lesser Balearian island, which is of a fertilesoil, but not equally powerful in men and arms. Here, therefore, theylanded, and pitched a camp in a strong position above the harbour;and having made themselves masters of the city and country without acontest, they enlisted two thousand auxiliaries, which they sent toCarthage, and then hauled their ships on shore for the winter. AfterMago had left the coast of the ocean, the people of Gades surrenderedto the Romans."Book 28,Chapter 38,"Such were the transactions in Spain under the conduct and auspicesof Publius Scipio. Scipio himself, having put Lucius Lentulus andLucius Manlius Acidinus in charge of the province, returned to Romewith ten ships. Having obtained an audience of the senate without thecity, in the temple of Bellona, he gave an account of the services hehad performed in Spain; how often he had fought pitched battles, howmany towns he had taken by force from the enemy, and what nations hehad brought under the dominion of the Roman people. He stated that hehad gone into Spain against four generals, and four victorious armies,but that he had not left a Carthaginian in that country. On account ofthese services he rather tried his prospect of a triumph, than pressedit pertinaciously; for it was quite clear, that no one had triumphedup to that time for services performed, when not invested with amagistracy. When the senate was dismissed he entered the city, andcarried before him into the treasury fourteen thousand three hundredand forty-two pounds of silver, and a great quantity of coined silver.Lucius Veturius Philo then held the assembly for the electionof consuls, when all the centuries, with the strongest marks ofattachment, named Publius Scipio as consul. Publius Licinius Crassus,chief pontiff, was joined with him as his colleague. It is recorded,that this election was attended by a greater number of persons thanany other during the war. People had come together from all quarters,not only to give their votes, but also for the purpose of seeingPublius Scipio. They ran in crowds, not only to his house, but also tothe Capitol; where he was engaged in offering a sacrifice of ahundred oxen to Jupiter, which he had vowed in Spain, impressed witha presentiment, that as Caius Lutatius had terminated the former Punicwar, so Publius Scipio would terminate the present; and that as he haddriven the Carthaginians out of every part of Spain, so he woulddrive them out of Italy; and dooming Africa to him as his province, asthough the war in Italy were at an end. The assembly was then heldfor the election of praetors. Two were elected who were then plebeianaediles, namely, Spurius Lucretius and Cneius Octavius; and of privatepersons, Cneius Servilius Caepio and Lucius Aemilius Papus.In the fourteenth year of the Punic war, Publius Cornelius Scipio andPublius Licinius Crassus entered on the consulship, when the provincesassigned to the consuls were, to Scipio, Sicily, without drawing lots,his colleague not opposing it, because the care of the sacred affairsrequired the presence of the chief pontiff in Italy; to Crassus,Bruttium. The provinces of the praetors were then put to thedetermination of lots, when the city jurisdiction fell to Servilius;Ariminum, for so they called Gaul, to Spurius Lucretius; Sicily toLucius Aemilius; Sardinia to Cneius Octavius. A senate was held inthe Capitol, when, on the motion of Publius Scipio, a decree was made,that he should exhibit the games which he had vowed in Spain duringthe mutiny of the soldiers, out of the money which he had himselfbrought into the treasury."Book 28,Chapter 39,"He then introduced into the senate the Saguntine ambassadors,the eldest of whom thus spoke: ""Although there remains no degree ofsuffering, conscript fathers, beyond what we have endured, in orderthat we might keep our faith towards you to the last; yet such arethe benefits which we have received both from yourselves and yourgenerals, that we do not repent of the calamities to which we haveourselves been exposed. On our account you undertook the war, andhaving undertaken it, you have continued to carry it on for now thefourteenth year with such inflexible perseverance, that frequently youhave both yourselves been reduced, and have brought the Carthaginiansto the last extremity. At a time when you had a war of such adesperate character in Italy, and Hannibal as your antagonist, yousent your consul with an army into Spain, to collect, as it were, theremains of our wreck. Publius and Cneius Cornelius, from the time theyentered the province, never ceased from adopting such measures as werefavourable to us and detrimental to our enemies. First of all,they restored to us our town; and, sending persons to collect ourcountrymen, who were sold and dispersed throughout all Spain, restoredthem from a state of slavery to freedom. When our circumstances, frombeing wretched in the extreme, had nearly assumed a desirable state,your generals Publius and Cneius Cornelius fell more to be lamented byourselves even than by you. Then truly we seemed to have been draggedback from distant places to our ancient abode, to perish again, andwitness the second destruction of our country. Nor did it appearthat there was any need forsooth of a Carthaginian army or generalto effect our destruction; but that we might be annihilated by theTurdulans, our most inveterate enemies, who had also been the cause ofour former overthrow. When suddenly, to our great surprise, you sentus this Publius Scipio, in seeing whom declared consul, and in havingit in our power to carry word back to our countrymen that we haveseen it, for on him our hopes and safety entirely rest, we considerourselves the most fortunate of all the Saguntines. He, when he hadtaken a great number of the cities of your enemies in Spain, on alloccasions separated the Saguntines out of the mass of captives, andsent them back to their country; and lastly, by his arms he reduced toso low a state Turdetania, which harboured such animosity againstus, that if that nation continued to flourish it was impossible thatSaguntum could stand, that it not only was not an object of fear tous, but, and may I say it without incurring odium, not even to ourposterity. We see the city of those persons demolished, to gratifywhom Hannibal destroyed Saguntum. We receive tribute from their lands,which is not more acceptable to us from the advantage we derive fromit than from revenge. In consideration of these benefits, than whichwe could not hope or wish for greater from the immortal gods, thesenate and people of Saguntum have sent us ten ambassadors to youto return their thanks; and at the same time to offer you theircongratulations on your having carried on your operations in Spainand Italy so successfully of late years, that you have subdued byyour arms, and have gotten possession of Spain, not only as far asthe river Iberus, but also to where the ocean forms the limit of theremotest regions of the world; while in Italy you have left nothingto the Carthaginian except so much space as the rampart of his campencloses. We have been desired, not only to return thanks for theseblessings to Jove most good and great, the guardian deity of thecapitoline citadel, but also, if you should permit us, to carry intothe Capitol this present of a golden crown in token of victory. Werequest that you would permit us so to do; and, if you thinkproper, that you would, by your authority, perpetuate and ratify theadvantages which your generals have conferred upon us."" The senatereplied to the Saguntines, ""that the destruction and restoration ofSaguntum would form a monument to all the nations of the world ofsocial faith preserved on both sides. That, in restoring Saguntum, andrescuing its citizens from slavery, their generals had acted properly,regularly, and according to the wishes of the senate; and that,whatever other acts of kindness they had done to them, were inconformity with the wishes of the senate. That they gave thempermission to deposit their present in the Capitol."" Orders were thengiven to furnish the ambassadors with apartments and entertainment,and that not less than ten thousand _asses_ should be given to each asa present. After this, the rest of the embassies were introduced andheard. On the request of the Saguntines that they might go and takea view of Italy as far as they could with safety, they were furnishedwith guides, and letters were sent to the several towns, requiringthem to entertain the Spaniards kindly. The senate then took intoconsideration the state of public affairs, the levying troops, and theprovinces."Book 28,Chapter 40,"It being generally reported that Africa, as a new province, wasdestined for Publius Scipio without casting lots; and he himself, notcontent with any moderate share of glory, asserting that he had beendeclared consul, not only for prosecuting, but for finishing the war;that that object could not be accomplished by any other means thanby his transporting an army into Africa; and himself openly declaringthat he would do it through the people if the senate opposed him; thedesign by no means pleased the principal senators; and when the rest,either through fear or a wish to ingratiate themselves with him, onlymurmured, Quintus Fabius Maximus, being asked his opinion, thus spoke:""I know, conscript fathers, that by many of you the question which isthis day agitated is considered as already determined; and that theman who shall deliver his sentiments on the subject of making Africa aprovince, as a new proposal, will speak to little purpose. But, in thefirst place, I cannot see how it can be considered as determined,that Africa shall be the province of the consul, that brave and activeofficer, when neither the senate have voted nor the people orderedthat it should be constituted a province this year. In the nextplace, if it is determined, I think the consul is to blame, who,by pretending to consult the senate on a question already decided,insults that body, and not the senator only who delivers hissentiments in his place on the subject of deliberation. Now I am wellaware, that by disapproving of this excessive eagerness to pass overinto Africa, I subject myself to two imputations: one grounded on thecaution inherent in my disposition, which young men may if theyplease call cowardice and sloth, so long as we have the consolationto reflect, that though hitherto the measures of others have alwaysappeared on the first view of them the more plausible, mine onexperience have proved the sounder. The other imputation is that ofjealousy and envy towards the daily increasing glory of this mostvaliant consul. But if neither my past life and character, nor adictatorship, together with five consulships, and so much gloryacquired, both in peace and war, that I am more likely to loathe itthan desire more, exempt me from such a suspicion, let my age at leastacquit me. For what rivalry can there exist between myself and a manwho is not equal in years even to my son? When I was dictator, whenas yet in the possession of full vigour, and engaged in a series ofaffairs of the utmost magnitude, no one heard me, either in the senateor in the popular assembly, express any reluctance to have the commandequally shared between myself and the master of the horse, at thetime when he was maligning me; a proposition which no one ever heardmention of before. I chose to bring it about by actions rather thanby words, that he who was placed on the same footing with me in thejudgment of others, should soon by his own confession declare me hissuperior. Much less, after having passed through these honours, wouldI propose to myself to enter the lists of competition and rivalry witha man in the very bloom of youth. And that, forsooth, in order thatAfrica, if it shall have been denied to him, may be assigned as aprovince to me, who am now weary of life, and not merely of activeemployments. I must live and die with that share of glory which I havealready acquired. I prevented Hannibal from conquering, in orderthat he might even be conquered by you, whose powers are now in fullvigour."Book 28,Chapter 41,"""It is but fair, Publius Cornelius, that you should pardon me,if I, who in my own case never preferred the honour of men to theinterest of the state, do not place even your fame before the publicgood. Although, if there were either no war in Italy, or an enemy ofsuch a description that no glory could be acquired from conqueringhim, the man who would retain you in Italy, though actuated by adesire to promote the public good, might appear to wish to depriveyou of an opportunity of acquiring renown when he objected to yourremoving the war. But since Hannibal is our antagonist, who isbesieging Italy for now the fourteenth year, with an army unimpaired,will you have reason to be dissatisfied, Publius Cornelius, with theglory you will acquire, if you in your consulate shall drive out ofItaly an enemy who has been the cause of so many deaths and so manydisasters to us, and if you should enjoy the distinction of havingterminated this, as Caius Lutatius did the former Punic war? Unlesseither Hamilcar is a general more worthy of consideration thanHannibal, or a war in Africa of more importance, or a victory theregreater and more glorious, (should it be our lot to be victoriouswhile you are consul,) than one here. Would you rather have drawn awayHamilcar from Drepanum and Eryx than have expelled the Carthaginiansand Hannibal from Italy? Although you naturally prize more highlythe renown which you have acquired than that which you hope for, yetsurely you would not boast more of having freed Spain from war than ofhaving freed Italy. Hannibal is not as yet in such a state as thatthe man who prefers another war would not appear to have feared ratherthan to have despised him. Why then do you not apply yourself tothis, and carry the war in a straightforward manner to the place whereHannibal is, rather than pursue that circuitous course, according towhich you expect that when you shall have crossed over intoAfrica Hannibal will follow you thither? Do you seek to obtain thedistinguished honour of having finished the Punic war? After you havedefended your own possessions, for this is naturally the first object,then proceed to attack those of others. Let there be peace in Italybefore war in Africa; and let us be free from fear ourselves beforewe bring it upon others. If it is possible that both objects may beaccomplished under your conduct and auspices, having first conqueredHannibal here, then go and lay siege to Carthage; but if one or otherof these conquests must be left for the succeeding consuls, the formeris both the greater and more glorious, and also the cause of thesecond. For now indeed, besides that the treasury is not able tomaintain two different armies, one in Italy and one in Africa; besidesthat we nave nothing left from which we may equip fleets or be able tofurnish provisions, who knows not how great danger would be incurred?Publius Licinius will wage war in Italy, Publius Scipio in Africa.What if, (an omen which may all the gods avert, and which my mindshrinks back with alarm from mentioning,--but what has happened mayhappen again,--) what I say, if Hannibal, having gained a victory,should advance to the city? Shall we then at length send for you, ourconsul, out of Africa, as we formerly sent for Quintus Fulvius fromCapua? What shall we say when we consider that in Africa also bothparties will be liable to the chances of war? Let your own house, yourfather and your uncle, slain together with their armies within thespace of thirty days, after that, having spent several years in theperformance of the most important services, both by sea and land, theyhad inspired foreign nations with the highest reverence for the nameof the Roman people and your family, be a warning to you. The daywould fail me were I disposed to enumerate the kings and generalswho have brought the most signal calamities upon themselves and theirarmies by rashly passing into the territories of their enemies. TheAthenians, a state distinguished for prudence, leaving a war at home,sent a great fleet into Sicily at the instance of a youth equallyenterprising and illustrious; but by one naval battle they reducedtheir flourishing republic to a state of humiliation from which shecould never recover."Book 28,Chapter 42,"""But I am adducing foreign and too remote examples. That sameAfrica, and Marcus Atilius, who was a signal example of bothextremes of fortune, may form a warning to us. Without doubt, PubliusCornelius, when you shall have a view of Africa from the sea, thereduction of your province of Spain will appear to you to have been amere matter of sport and pastime. For what similarity is there betweenthem? After sailing along the coast of Italy and Gaul to Emporiaewithout any enemy to oppose you, you brought your fleet to land ata city of our allies. There landing your soldiers, you marched themthrough countries entirely secure from danger to Tarraco, to join theallies and friends of the Roman people. After that, from Tarraco youmarched through places garrisoned by Roman troops. On the banks of theIberus were the armies of your father and your uncle, rendered stillmore furious after the loss of their generals, even by the verycalamity they had suffered. The general, indeed, Lucius Marcius, hadbeen irregularly constituted and chosen for the time by the suffragesof the soldiers; but had he been adorned with noble birth and theregular gradation of preferment, he would have been equal to the mostdistinguished generals, from his skill in every art of war. You thenlaid siege to Carthage, quite at your leisure, not one of the threePunic armies coming to the defence of their allies. The rest of yourachievements, nor do I wish to disparage them, are by no means to becompared with what you will have to do in a war in Africa, where thereis not a single harbour open to receive our fleet, no part of thecountry at peace with us, no state in alliance, no king in friendshipwith us, no room in any part either to take up a position or toadvance. Whichever way you turn your eyes, all is hostility anddanger. Do you trust in the Numidians and Syphax? Let it suffice tohave trusted in them once. Temerity is not always successful, and thefraudulent usually pave the way to confidence in small matters, thatwhen an advantageous opportunity occurs, they may deceive with greatgain. Your father and uncle were not cut off by the arms of theirenemies till they were duped by the treachery of their Celtiberianallies; nor were you yourself exposed to so much danger from Magoand Hasdrubal, the generals of your enemies, as from Indibilis andMandonius, whom you had received into friendship. Can you place anyconfidence in Numidians after having experienced a defection in yourown soldiers? Syphax and Masinissa would rather that they themselvesshould have the rule in Africa than the Carthaginians, but that theCarthaginians should rather than any other state. At present emulationand the various causes of dispute existing between them incite themagainst each other, because the fear of any foreign enemy is remote.But show them the Roman arms and a body of troops, natives of anothercountry, and they will run together as if to extinguish a commonconflagration. These same Carthaginians defended Spain in a differentmanner from that in which they will defend the walls of their capital,the temples of their gods, their altars, and their hearths; when theirterrified wives will attend them on the way to the battle, andtheir little children will run to them. What, moreover, if theCarthaginians, feeling sufficiently secure in the harmony subsistingin Africa, in the attachment of the sovereigns in alliance with them,and their own fortifications, should, when they see Italy deprivedof the support of yourself and your army, themselves assuming anoffensive attitude, either send a fresh army out of Africa intoItaly, or order Mago, who, it is certain, having passed over from theBaleares, is now sailing along the coast of Liguria and the Alps, toform a junction with Hannibal. Without doubt, we should be thrown intothe same state of alarm as we were lately, when Hasdrubal passed overinto Italy; that Hasdrubal, whom you, who are about to blockade, notCarthage only, but all Africa with your army, allowed to slip out ofyour hands into Italy. You will say that he was conquered by you.For that very reason I should be less willing, not on account of thecommonwealth only, but of yourself, that, after having been defeated,he should be allowed to march into Italy. Suffer us to ascribe to yourprudence all the successful events which have happened to you andthe empire of the Roman people, and to impute all those of an adversenature to the uncertain chances of war and to fortune. The moremeritorious and brave you are, so much the more do your country andall Italy desire to retain you as their protector. You cannot evenyourself pretend to deny, that where Hannibal is, there is the headand principal stress of the war, for you profess, that your motivein crossing over into Africa is to draw Hannibal thither. Whether,therefore, here or there, it is with Hannibal that you will have tocontend. Will you then, I pray, have more power in Africa and alone,or here, with your own and your colleague's army united? Is not thegreat difference which this makes proved to you even by the recentprecedent of Claudius and Livius, the consuls? What! will Hannibal,who has now for a long time been unavailingly soliciting succours fromhome, be rendered more powerful in men and arms when occupying theremotest corner of the Bruttian territory, or when near to Carthageand supported by all Africa? What sort of policy is that of yours, toprefer fighting where your own forces will be diminished by one half,and the enemy's greatly augmented, to encountering the enemy whenyou will have two armies against one, and that wearied with so manybattles, and so protracted and laborious a service? Consider how farthis policy of yours corresponds with that of your parent. He, settingout in his consulship for Spain, returned from his province intoItaly, that he might meet Hannibal on his descent from the Alps; whileyou are going to leave Italy when Hannibal is there, not because youconsider such a course beneficial to the state, but because you thinkit will redound to your own honour and glory; acting in the samemanner as you did when leaving your province and your army without thesanction of a law, without a decree of the senate, you, a generalof the Roman people, intrusted to two ships the fortune of thecommonwealth and the majesty of the empire, which were then hazardedin your person. In my estimation, conscript fathers, Publius Corneliuswas elected consul for the service of the state and of us, and not toforward his own individual interest; and the armies were enlisted forthe protection of the city and of Italy, and not for the consuls,like kings, to carry into whatever part of the world they please frommotives of vanity."""Book 28,Chapter 43,"Fabius having made a strong impression on a large portion of thesenate, and especially those advanced in years, by this speech,which was adapted to the occasion, and also by his authority and hislong-established reputation for prudence; and those who approvedof the counsel of this old man being more numerous than those whocommended the hot spirit of the young one; Scipio is reported thusto have spoken: ""Even Quintus Fabius himself has observed, conscriptfathers, in the commencement of his speech, that in the opinion hegave a feeling of jealousy might be suspected. And though I darenot myself charge so great a man with harbouring that feeling, yet,whether it is owing to a defect in his language, or to the fact, thatsuspicion has certainly not been removed. For he has so magnified hisown honours and the fame of his exploits, in order to do away withthe imputation of envy, that it would appear I am in danger of beingrivalled by every obscure person, but not by himself, because, as heenjoys an eminence above every body else, an eminence to which I donot dissemble that I also aspire, he is unwilling that I should beplaced upon a level with him. He has represented himself as an oldman, and as one who has gone through every gradation of honour, and meas below the age even of his son; as if he supposed that the desireof glory did not exceed the limits of human life, and as if its chiefpart had not respect to memory and future ages. I am confident, thatit is usual with all the most exalted minds, to compare themselves,not only with the illustrious men of the present, but of every age.For my own part, I do not dissemble that I am desirous, not only toattain to the share of glory which you possess, Quintus Fabius, but,(and in saying it I mean no offence,) if I can, even to exceed it. Letnot such a feeling exist in your mind towards me, nor in mine towardsthose who are my juniors, as that we should be unwilling that any ofour countrymen should attain to the same celebrity with ourselves; forthat would be a detriment, not to those only who may be the objectsof our envy, but to the state, and almost to the whole human race. Hementioned what a great degree of danger I should incur, should I crossover into Africa, so that he appeared solicitous on my account, andnot only for the state and the army. But whence has this concern forme so suddenly sprung? When my father and uncle were slain; when theirtwo armies were cut up almost to a man; when Spain was lost; when fourarmies of the Carthaginians and four generals kept possession of everything by terror and by arms; when a general was sought for to take thecommand of that war, and no one came forward besides myself, no onehad the courage to declare himself a candidate; when the Roman peoplehad conferred the command upon me, though only twenty-four years ofage; why was it that no one at that time made any mention of my age,of the strength of the enemy, of the difficulty of the war, and of therecent destruction of my father and uncle? Has some greater disasterbeen suffered in Africa now than had at that time befallen usin Spain? Are there now larger armies in Africa, more and bettergenerals, than were then in Spain? Was my age then more mature forconducting a war than now? Can a war with a Carthaginian enemy becarried on with greater convenience in Spain than in Africa? Afterhaving routed and put to flight four Carthaginian armies; after havingcaptured by force, or reduced to submission by fear, so many cities;after having entirely subdued every thing as far as the ocean, somany petty princes, so many savage nations; after having regainedpossession of the whole of Spain, so that no trace of war remains,it is an easy matter to make light of my services; just as easy asit would be, should I return victorious from Africa, to make light ofthose very circumstances which are now magnified in order that theymay appear formidable, for the purpose of detaining me here. He saysthat there is no possibility of entering Africa; that there are noports open. He mentions that Marcus Atilius was taken prisoner inAfrica, as if Marcus Atilius had miscarried on his first access toAfrica. Nor does he recollect that the ports of Africa were open tothat very commander, unfortunate as he was; that he performed somebrilliant services during the first year, and continued undefeatedto the last, so far as related to the Carthaginian generals. You willnot, therefore, in the least deter me by that example of yours. Ifthat disaster had been sustained in the present, and not in the formerwar, if lately, and not forty years ago, yet why would it be lessadvisable for me to cross over into Africa after Regulus had beenmade prisoner there, than into Spain after the Scipios had been slainthere? I should be reluctant to admit that the birth of Xanthippusthe Lacedaemonian was more fortunate for Carthage than mine for mycountry. My confidence would be increased by the very circumstance,that such important consequences depended upon the valour of oneman. But further, we must take warning by the Athenians, whoinconsiderately crossed over into Sicily, leaving a war in their owncountry. Why, therefore, since you have leisure to relate Greciantales, do you not rather set before us the instance of Agathocles,king of Syracuse, who, when Sicily was for a long time wasted by aPunic war, by passing over into this same Africa, removed the war tothe country from whence it came."Book 28,Chapter 44,"""But what need is there of ancient and foreign examples to remindus what sort of thing it is boldly to carry terror against an enemy,and, removing the danger from oneself, to bring another into peril?Can there be a stronger instance than Hannibal himself, or one moreto the point? It makes a great difference whether you devastate theterritories of another, or see your own destroyed by fire and sword.He who brings danger upon another has more spirit than he who repelsit. Add to this, that the terror excited by unknown circumstances isincreased on that account. When you have entered the territory of anenemy, you may have a near view of his advantages and disadvantages.Hannibal did not expect that it would come to pass that so many of thestates in Italy would come over to him as did so after the defeat atCannae. How much less would any firmness or constancy be experiencedin Africa by the Carthaginians, who are themselves faithless allies,oppressive and haughty masters! Besides, we, even when deserted byour allies, stood firm in our own strength, the Roman soldiery. TheCarthaginians possess no native strength. The soldiers they have areobtained by hire;--Africans and Numidians--people remarkable aboveall others for the inconstancy of their attachments. Provided noimpediment arises here, you will hear at once that I have landed, andthat Africa is blazing with war; that Hannibal is preparing for hisdeparture from this country, and that Carthage is besieged. Expectmore frequent and more joyful despatches from Africa than you receivedfrom Spain. The considerations on which I ground my anticipations arethe good fortune of the Roman people, the gods, the witnesses of thetreaty violated by the enemy, the kings Syphax and Masinissa; on whosefidelity I will rely in such a manner as that I may be secure fromdanger should they prove perfidious. Many things which are not nowapparent, at this distance, the war will develope; and it is thepart of a man, and a general, not to be wanting when fortune presentsitself, and to bend its events to his designs. I shall, QuintusFabius, have the opponent you assign me, Hannibal; but I shall ratherdraw him after me than be kept here by him. I will compel him to fightin his own country, and Carthage shall be the prize of victory ratherthan the half-ruined forts of the Bruttians. With regard to providingthat the state sustain no injury in the mean time, while I am crossingover, while I am landing my troops in Africa, while I am advancingmy camp to the walls of Carthage; be not too sure that it is not aninsult to Publius Licinius, the consul, a man of consummate valour,who did not draw lots for so distant a province merely that, as he waschief pontiff, he might not be absent from religious affairs, tosay that he is unable to do that, now that the power of Hannibal isshaken, and in a manner shattered, which you Quintus Fabius, wereable to effect when he was flying victorious throughout all Italy.By Hercules, even if the war would not be more speedily terminated byadopting the plan I propose, yet it were consistent with the dignityof the Roman people, and the high character they enjoy with foreignkings and nations, to appear to have had spirit not only to defendItaly, but also to carry hostilities into Africa; and that it shouldnot be supposed and spread abroad that no Roman general dared whatHannibal had dared; that in the former Punic war, when the contest wasabout Sicily, Africa should have been so often attacked by our fleetsand armies, and that now, when the contest is about Italy, Africashould be left undisturbed. Let Italy, which has so long beenharassed, at length enjoy some repose; let Africa, in her turn,be fired and devastated. Let the Roman camp overhang the gates ofCarthage rather than that we should again behold the rampart of theenemy from our walls. Let Africa be the seat of the remainder of thewar. Let terror and flight, the devastation of lands, the defection ofallies, and all the other calamities of war which have fallen uponus, through a period of fourteen years, be turned upon her. It issufficient for me to have spoken on those matters which relate to thestate, the war before us, and the provinces which form the subject ofdeliberation. My discourse would be tedious and uninteresting to youif, as Fabius has depreciated my services in Spain, I should alsoin like manner endeavour, on the other hand, to turn his glory intoridicule, and make the most of my own. I will do neither, conscriptfathers; and if in nothing else, though a young man, I shall certainlyhave shown my superiority over this old man, in modesty and thegovernment of my tongue. Such has been my life, and such the servicesI have performed, that I can gladly rest contented in silence withthat opinion which you have spontaneously conceived of me."""Book 28,Chapter 45,"Scipio was heard less favourably, because, a report had beenspread that, if he did not prevail with the senate to have Africadecreed to him as his province, he would immediately lay the matterbefore the people. Therefore, Quintus Fulvius, who had been consulfour times, and censor, requested of the consul that he would openlydeclare in the senate whether ""he submitted to the fathers to deciderespecting the provinces; and whether he intended to abide by theirdetermination, or to put it to the people."" Scipio having replied thathe would act as he thought for the interest of the state, Fulvius thenrejoined: ""When I asked you the question I was not ignorant of whatanswer you would give, or how you would act; for you plainly show thatyou are rather sounding than consulting the senate; and, unless weimmediately decree to you the province you wish, have a bill ready(to lay before the people). Therefore,"" said he, ""I require of you,tribunes of the people, to support me in refusing to give my opinion,because, though my recommendation should be adopted, the consul isnot disposed to abide by it."" An altercation then arose, the consulasserting that it was unfair for the tribunes to interpose so as toprevent any senator from living his opinion in his place on beingasked it. The tribunes came to the determination, ""that if the consulsubmit to the senate the question relating to the provinces, whateverthe senate decree we shall consider as final, nor will we allow a billto be proposed to the people on the subject. If he does not submitit to them, we will support any one who shall refuse to deliver hissentiments upon the matter."" The consul requested the delay of a dayto confer with his colleague. The next day the decision was submittedto the senate. The provinces were assigned in this manner: to one ofthe consuls Sicily and thirty ships of war, which Caius Servilius hadcommanded the former year; he was also permitted to cross over intoAfrica if he conceived it to be for the advantage of the state. To theother consul Bruttium and the war with Hannibal were assigned; witheither that army which Lucius Veturius or that which Quintus Caeciliuscommanded. The two latter were to draw lots, and settle betweenthemselves which should act in Bruttium with the two legions whichthe consul gave up; and he to whose lot that province fell, was to becontinued in command for a year. The other persons also, besidesthe consuls and praetors, who were to take the command of armies andprovinces, were continued in command. It fell to the lot of QuintusCaecilius to carry on the war against Hannibal in Bruttium, togetherwith the consul. The games of Scipio were then celebrated in thepresence of a great number of persons, and with the approbation of thespectators. The deputies, Marcus Pomponius Matho and Quintus Catius,sent to Delphi to convey a present out of the spoils taken fromHasdrubal, carried with them a golden crown of two hundred pounds'weight, and representations of the spoils made out of a thousandpounds' weight of silver. Scipio, though he could not obtain leaveto levy troops, a point which he did not urge with great eagerness,obtained leave to take with him such as volunteered their services;and also, as he declared that the fleet would not be the occasion ofexpense to the state, to receive what was furnished by the allies forbuilding fresh ships. First, the states of Etruria engaged to assistthe consuls to the utmost of their respective abilities. The peopleof Caere furnished corn, and provisions of every description, for thecrews; the people of Populoni furnished iron; of Tarquinii, clothfor sails; those of Volaterrae, planks for ships, and corn; those ofArretium, thirty thousand shields, as many helmets; and of javelins,Gallic darts, and long spears, they undertook to make up to the amountof fifty thousand, an equal number of each description, togetherwith as many axes, mattocks, bills, buckets, and mills, as should besufficient for fifty men of war, with a hundred and twenty thousandpecks of wheat; and to contribute to the support of the decurios androwers on the voyage. The people of Perusia, Clusium, and Rusellafurnished firs for building ships, and a great quantity of corn.Scipio had firs out of the public woods. The states of Umbria, and,besides them, the people of Nursia, Reate, and Amiternum, andall those of the Sabine territory, promised soldiers. Many of theMarsians, Pelignians, and Marrucinians volunteered to serve in thefleet. The Cameritans, as they were joined with the Romans in leagueon equal terms, sent an armed cohort of six hundred men. Having laidthe keels of thirty ships, twenty of which were quinqueremes, and tenquadriremes, he prosecuted the work with such diligence, that, on theforty-fifth day after the materials were taken from the woods, theships, being fully equipped and armed, were launched."Book 28,Chapter 46,"He set out into Sicily with thirty ships of war, with about seventhousand volunteers on board. Publius Licinius came into Bruttium tothe two consular armies, of which he selected for himself that whichLucius Veturius, the consul, had commanded. He allowed Metellus tocontinue in the command of those legions which were before under him,concluding that he could act more easily with the troops accustomed tohis command. The praetors also went to their different provinces. Asthere was a scarcity of money to carry on the war, the quaestors wereordered to sell a district of the Campanian territory extending fromthe Grecian trench to the sea, with permission to receive informationas to what land belonged to a native Campanian, in order that it mightbe put into the possession of the Roman people. The reward fixedupon for the informer was a tenth part of the value of the lands sodiscovered. Cneius Servilius, the city praetor, was also charged withseeing that the Campanians dwelt where they were allowed, according tothe decree of the senate, and to punish such as dwelt anywhere else.The same summer, Mago, son of Amilcar, setting out from the lesser ofthe Balearian islands, where he had wintered, having put on boardhis fleet a chosen body of young men, conveyed over into Italy twelvethousand foot, and about two thousand horse, with about thirty shipsof war, and a great number of transports. By the suddenness of hisarrival he took Genoa, as there were no troops employed in protectingthe sea-coast. Thence he brought his fleet to shore, on the coast ofthe Alpine Ligurians, to see if he could create any commotion there.The Ingaunians, a tribe of the Ligurians, were at that junctureengaged in war with the Epanterians, a people inhabiting themountains. The Carthaginian, therefore, having deposited his plunderat Savo, an Alpine town, left ten ships of war for its protection. Hesent the rest to Carthage to guard the sea-coast, as it was reportedthat Scipio intended to pass over thither; formed an alliance withthe Ingaunians, whose friendship he preferred; and commenced an attackupon the mountaineers. His army increased daily, the Gauls flocking tohis standard from all sides, from the splendour of his fame. When thesenate received information of these things, by a letter from SpuriusLucretius, they were filled with the most intense anxiety, lest thejoy they had experienced on the destruction of Hasdrubal and his army,two years before, should be rendered vain by another war's springingup in the same quarter, equal in magnitude, but under a new leader.They therefore ordered Marcus Livius, proconsul, to march his armyof volunteer slaves out of Etruria to Ariminum, and gave in charge toCneius Servilius to issue orders, if he thought it necessary for thesafety of the state, that the city legions should be marched out underthe command of any person he thought proper. Marcus Valerius Laevinusled those legions to Arretium. About the same time, as many as eightytransports of the Carthaginians were captured, near Sardinia, byCneius Octavius, who had the government of that province. Caeliusstates that they were laden with corn and provisions, sent forHannibal; Valerius, that they were conveying the plunder of Etruria,and the Ligurian mountaineers who had been captured, to Carthage.In Bruttium scarcely any thing was done this year worth recording.A pestilence had attacked both Romans and Carthaginians with equalviolence; but the Carthaginian army, in addition to sickness, wasdistressed by famine. Hannibal passed the summer near the templeof Juno Lacinia, where he erected and dedicated an altar with aninscription engraved in Punic and Greek characters, setting forth, inpompous terms, the achievements he had performed."Book 29,Chapter 1,"Scipio, after his arrival in Sicily, formed his volunteers intocohorts and centuries. Of these he kept about his person three hundredyoung men, in the bloom of their age and the prime of their strength,unarmed, and not knowing for what purpose they were reserved, as theywere not included in the centuries, nor furnished with arms. He thenselected out of the number of the youth of all Sicily three hundredhorsemen, of the highest birth and fortune, who were to cross overwith him into Africa, appointing a day on which they were to presentthemselves equipped and furnished with horses and arms. This severeservice, far from their native land, appeared to them likely to beattended with many hardships, and great dangers, both by sea and land;nor did that anxiety affect themselves alone, but also their parentsand relations. When the appointed day arrived, they exhibited theirarms and horses. Then Scipio observed, ""that an intimation had beenconveyed to him that certain of the Sicilian horsemen felt a strongaversion to that service, as being severe and arduous. If there wereany who entertained such a feeing, that he would rather they shouldthen confess it to him, than, complaining afterwards, prove themselvesslothful and useless soldiers to the state. He desired that they wouldopenly avow their sentiments, for that he would hear them with kindlyfeeling."" When one of the number took courage to declare, that if hewere allowed the uncontrolled exercise of his will he certainly wouldnot serve, Scipio replied to him thus: ""Since then, young man, youhave not dissembled your sentiments, I will furnish a substitute foryou, to whom I request that you transfer your arms, your horse, andother appliances of war; and, taking him hence immediately toyour house, train him, and take care that he is instructed in themanagement of his horse and arms."" The youth accepted the termsjoyfully, when Scipio delivered to him one of the three hundred whomhe kept unarmed. The rest, seeing the horseman thus dischargedwithout giving any offence to the general, began severally toexcuse themselves and receive substitutes. Thus Roman horsemen weresubstituted for the three hundred Sicilian, without any expense to thestate. The Sicilians had the care of instructing and training them,because the general had ordered that the man who should not doso, should serve himself. It is said that this turned out to be anadmirable body of cavalry, and rendered effectual service to the statein many engagements. Afterwards, inspecting the legions, he chose outof them such soldiers as had served the greatest number of campaigns,particularly those who had acted under Marcellus; for he consideredthat they were formed under the best discipline, and also, from thelong time in which they were engaged in the siege of Syracuse, weremost skilled in the assault of towns: for his thoughts were nowoccupied with no small object, but the destruction of Carthage. Hethen distributed his army through the towns; ordered the Sicilianstates to furnish corn, sparing that which had been brought fromItaly; repaired his old ships, and sent Caius Laelius with them intoAfrica to plunder. His new ships he hauled on shore at Panormus, thatthey might be kept on land during the winter, as they had been hastilybuilt of unseasoned timber.When every thing was got in readiness for the war he came to Syracuse,which had hardly yet returned to a state of tranquillity, after theviolent commotions of the war. The Greeks, demanding restitution oftheir property, which had been granted to them by the senate, fromcertain persons of the Italian nation, who retained possession of itin the same forcible manner in which they had seized it in the war,Scipio, who deemed it of the first importance to preserve thepublic faith, restored their property to the Syracusans, partly byproclamation, and partly even by judgments pronounced against thosewho pertinaciously retained their unjust acquisitions. This measurewas acceptable not only to the persons immediately concerned, but toall the states of Sicily, and so much the more energetically did theygive aid in the war. During the same summer a very formidable warsprang up in Spain, at the instance of Indibilis the Hergetian, fromno other cause than the contempt he conceived for the other generals,in consequence of his admiration of Scipio. He considered ""that he wasthe only commander the Romans had left, the rest having been slain byHannibal. That they had, therefore, no other general whom theycould send into Spain after the Scipios were cut off there, and thatafterwards, when the war in Italy pressed upon them with increasedseverity, he was recalled to oppose Hannibal. That, in addition to thefact that the Romans had the names only of generals in Spain, theirold army had also been withdrawn thence. That all the troops they hadthere were irresolute, as consisting of an undisciplined multitude ofrecruits. That there would never again occur such an opportunity forthe liberation of Spain. That up to that time they had been the slaveseither of Carthaginians or Romans, and that not to one or the other inturns, but sometimes to both together. That the Carthaginians had beendriven out by the Romans, and that the Romans might be driven out bythe Spaniards, if they would unite: so that Spain, for ever freedfrom a foreign yoke, might return to her native customs and rites.""By these and other observations he stirred up not only his countrymen,but the Ausetanians also, a neighbouring nation, as well as otherstates bordering on his own and their country. Accordingly, within afew days, thirty thousand foot and about four thousand horse assembledin the Sedetanian territory, according to the orders which had beengiven."Book 29,Chapter 2,"On the other side, the Roman generals also, Lucius Lentulus andLucius Manlius Acidinus, lest by neglecting the first beginnings ofthe war it should increase in violence, having united their armies,and led their troops through the Ausetanian territory in a peaceablemanner, as though it had been the territory of friends instead ofenemies, came to the position of the enemy, and pitched their campat a distance of three miles from theirs. At first an unsuccessfulattempt was made, through ambassadors, to induce them to lay downtheir arms; then the Spanish cavalry making a sudden attack on theRoman foragers, a body of cavalry was sent to support them from theRoman outposts, when a battle between the cavalry took place with nomemorable issue to either side. The next day, at sun-rise, the wholeforce displayed their line, armed and drawn out for battle, at thedistance of about a mile from the Roman camp. The Ausetanians were inthe centre, the right wing was occupied by the Ilergetians, the leftby some inconsiderable states of Spain. Between the wings and thecentre they had left intervals of considerable extent, through whichthey might send out their cavalry when occasion required. The Romansalso, drawing up their army in their usual manner, imitated the enemyin respect only of leaving themselves also intervals between thelegions to afford passages for their cavalry. Lentulus, however,concluding that the cavalry could be employed with advantage by thoseonly who should be the first to send them against the enemy's line,thus broken by intervals, ordered Servius Cornelius, a militarytribune, to direct the cavalry to ride at full speed into the spacesleft in the enemy's line. Lentulus himself, as the battle between theinfantry was somewhat unfavourable in its commencement, waited onlyuntil he had brought up from the reserve into the front line thethirteenth legion to support the twelfth legion, which had beenposted in the left wing, against the Ilergetians, and which was givingground. And when the battle was thus placed on an equal footing inthat quarter, he came to Lucius Manlius, who was exhorting the troopsin the foremost line, and bringing up the reserves in such places ascircumstances required, and told him that all was safe in the leftwing, and that Cornelius Servius, who had been sent by him for thatpurpose, would soon pour round the enemy a storm of cavalry. He hadscarcely uttered these words, when the Roman horse, riding intothe midst of the enemy, at once threw their line of infantry intodisorder, and closed up the passage by which the Spanish cavalrywere to advance. The Spaniards, therefore, giving up all thoughts offighting on horseback, dismounted and fought on foot. When the Romangenerals saw that the ranks of the enemy were in confusion, that theywere in a state of trepidation and dismay, their standards moving toand fro, they exhorted and implored their men to charge them whilethus discomfited, and not allow them to form their line again.So desperate was their charge that the barbarians could not havewithstood the shock, had not the prince Indibilis in person, togetherwith the discounted cavalry, opposed himself to the enemy before thefront rank of the infantry. There an obstinate contest continued for aconsiderable time; but those who fought round the king, who continuedhis resistance though almost expiring, and who was afterwards pinnedto the earth by a javelin, having at length fallen, overwhelmed withdarts, a general flight took place; and the number slain was thegreater because the horsemen were prevented from remounting, andbecause the Romans pressed impetuously upon the discomfited troops;nor did they give over until they had deprived the enemy of theircamp. On that day thirteen thousand Spaniards were slain, and abouteight hundred captured. Of the Romans and allies there fell a littlemore than two hundred, and those principally in the left wing. Suchof the Spaniards as were beaten out of their camp, or had escaped fromthe battle, at first dispersed themselves through the country, butafterwards returned each to his own state."Book 29,Chapter 3,"They were then summoned to an assembly by Mandonius, at which,after complaining bitterly of the losses they had sustained, andupbraiding the instigators of the war, they resolved that ambassadorsshould be sent with proposals to deliver up their arms and make asurrender. These, laying the blame on Indibilis, the instigator of thewar, and the other chiefs, most of whom had fallen in the battle, andoffering to deliver up their arms and surrender themselves, receivedfor answer, that their surrender would be accepted on condition thatthey delivered up alive Mandonius and the rest of the persons who hadfomented the war; but if they refused to comply, that armies should bemarched into the territories of the Ilergetians and Ausetanians, andafterwards into those of the other states in succession. This answergiven to the ambassadors, was reported to the assembly, andMandonius and the other chiefs were there seized and delivered upfor punishment. Peace was restored to the states of Spain, whichwere ordered to pay double taxes that year, and furnish corn for sixmonths, together with cloaks and gowns for the army; and hostages weretaken from about thirty of the states.The tumult occasioned by the rebellion in Spain having been thusexcited and suppressed within the space of a few days, without anygreat disturbance, the whole terror of the war was directed againstAfrica. Caius Laelius having arrived at Hippo Regius by night, atbreak of day led his soldiers and mariners in regular array to laywaste the country. As all the inhabitants were living unguardedly, asin a time of peace, great damage was done; and messengers, flying interror, filled Carthage with alarm, by reporting that the Roman fleetand the general, Scipio, had arrived; for there was a rumour thatScipio had already crossed over into Sicily. Not knowing accuratelyhow many ships they had seen, or how large a body of troops wasdevastating the country, they, under the influence of fear, whichrepresented them as greater than they really were, exaggerated everything. Accordingly, at first, terror and dismay took possession oftheir minds, but afterwards grief, when they reflected that theircircumstances had undergone so great a change; that they, who latelyas conquerors had an army before the walls of Rome, and, after havinglaid prostrate so many armies of the enemy, had received the surrenderof all the states of Italy, either by force or choice, now, thewar having taken an unfavourable turn, were destined to behold thedevastation of Africa and the siege of Carthage, without any thinglike the resources to enable them to bear up against those calamitieswhich the Romans possessed. To the latter the Roman commons andLatium afforded a supply of young men, which continually grew up morevigorous and more numerous, in the room of so many armies destroyed,while their own people, both those in the city and those in thecountry, were unfit for military service; their troops consisted ofauxiliaries, procured by hire from the Africans, a faithless nation,and veering about with every gale of fortune. Now too, with regard tothe kings, Syphax was alienated from them since his conference withScipio, and Masinissa, by an open defection, had become their mostdetermined enemy. Wherever they turned their eyes there was no hope,no aid. Neither did Mago excite any commotion on the side of Gaul, norjoin his forces with those of Hannibal; while Hannibal himself was nowdeclining both in reputation and strength."Book 29,Chapter 4,"Their minds, which had fallen into these melancholy reflections inconsequence of the intelligence they had just received, were broughtback by their immediate fears to deliberate how to oppose the instantdanger. They resolved, that troops should be hastily levied bothin the city and in the country; that persons should be sent to hireauxiliaries from the Africans; that the city should be fortified, corncollected, weapons and arms prepared, and ships equipped and sentto Hippo against the Roman fleet. But now, while engaged in thesematters, news at length arrived that it was Laelius, and not Scipio;that the forces which he had brought over were only what weresufficient for making predatory incursions into the country, and thatthe principal stress of the war still lay in Sicily. Thus they wereenabled to take breath, and they began to send embassies to Syphaxand the other petty princes, for the purpose of strengthening theiralliances. To Philip also ambassadors were sent, to promise him twohundred talents of silver, if he would cross over into Sicily orItaly. Ambassadors were also sent into Italy to the two generals, todesire them to keep Scipio at home by terrifying the enemy inevery way they could. To Mago, not only ambassadors were sent, buttwenty-five men of war, six thousand infantry, eight hundred horse,and seven elephants, besides a large sum of money to be employed inhiring auxiliaries, in order that, encouraged by these aids, he mightadvance his army nearer to the city of Rome, and form a junction withHannibal. Such were the preparations and plans at Carthage. WhileLaelius was employed in carrying off an immense quantity of bootyfrom the country, the inhabitants of which had no arms, and which wasdestitute of forces, Masinissa, moved by the report of the arrivalof the Roman fleet, came to him attended by a small body of horse.He complained that ""Scipio had not acted with promptness in thisbusiness, in that he had not already passed his army over into Africa,while the Carthaginians were in consternation, and while Syphax wasentangled in wars with the neighbouring states, and in doubt anduncertainty as to the course he should take; that if time was allowedto Syphax to adjust his own affairs according to his mind, he wouldnot in any thing keep his faith with the Romans inviolate."" Herequested that he would exhort and stimulate Scipio not to delay.Though driven from his kingdom, he said he would join him with nodespicable force of foot and horse. Nor was it right, said he thatLaelius should continue in Africa, for he believed that a fleet hadset sail from Carthage, with which, in the absence of Scipio, it wouldnot be altogether safe to engage."Book 29,Chapter 5,"After this discourse Masinissa departed. Laelius, the next day,sailed from Hippo with his ships loaded with booty, and returning toSicily, delivered to Scipio the injunctions of Masinissa. About thesame time the ships which were sent from Carthage to Mago touchedat the country between the Albingaunian Ligurians and Genoa. Magohappened to be lying here with his fleet at this time. After hearingthe message of the ambassadors, directing him to collect as great anumber of troops as possible, he immediately held a council of theGauls and Ligurians, for a great number of both those nations werethere. He said that he was sent to restore them to liberty, and, asthey themselves might see, succours were sent him from home; but thatit depended upon them with how great forces and how large an army thewar for that purpose was to be carried on. That the Romans had twoarmies in the field, one in Gaul and another in Etruria. That he waswell informed that Spurius Lucretius would form a junction with MarcusLivius, and that they on their part must arm many thousands, in orderto cope with two Roman generals and two armies. The Gauls replied,that they had the strongest possible inclination to this, but asthe Romans had one army within their borders, and another in theneighbouring country of Etruria, almost within sight, if it shouldbe known that they had supported the Carthaginians with auxiliaries,those would immediately invade their territories on both sides withdetermined hostility. They requested that he would ask of the Gaulssuch aids as they could afford in a covert manner. The purposes of theLigurians, they said, were unrestrained, because the Roman troops wereat a distance from their lands and cities; that it was fair that theyshould arm their youth and take upon themselves a portion of the war.The Ligurians did not dissent; they only requested the space of twomonths to make their levies. Having dismissed the Gauls, Mago in themean time secretly hired soldiers through their country. Provisionsalso of every description were sent to him privately by the Gallicstates. Marcus Livius led his army of volunteer slaves out of Etruriainto Gaul, and having joined Lucretius, prepared to meet Mago in casehe should move from Liguria nearer to the city; but intending, if theCarthaginian should keep himself quiet under the angle formed by theAlps, to remain himself also in the same quarter, near Ariminum, forthe protection of Italy."Book 29,Chapter 6,"After the return of Caius Laelius from Africa, though Scipio wasgoaded on by the exhortations of Masinissa; and the soldiers, onseeing the booty which was taken from the enemy's country landed fromthe whole fleet, were inflamed with the strongest desire to cross overas soon as possible; this important object was interrupted by oneof minor consideration, namely, that of regaining the town of Locri,which at the time of the general defection of Italy had itself alsogone over to the Carthaginians. The hope of accomplishing this objectbeamed forth from a very trifling circumstance. The war was carried onin Bruttium rather in a predatory than a regular manner, the Numidianshaving set the example, and the Bruttians falling in with thatpractice, not more in consequence of their connexion with theCarthaginians, than from their natural inclination. At last the Romansalso, who now took delight in plunder by a sort of infection, madeexcursions into the lands of their enemies so far as their leaderswould permit it. Some Locrians who had gone out of the town, weresurrounded by them and carried off to Rhegium. Among the number ofthe prisoners were certain artisans, who, as it happened, had beenaccustomed to work for the Carthaginians in the city of Locri forhire. They were recognised by some of the Locrian nobles, who havingbeen driven out by the opposite faction, which had delivered up Locrito Hannibal, had retired to Rhegium; and having answered their otherquestions relative to what was going on at home, questions which areusually put by such as have been long absent, they gave them hopesthat, if ransomed and sent back, they might be able to deliver up thecitadel to them; for there they resided, and among the Carthaginiansthey enjoyed unlimited confidence. Accordingly, as these nobles wereat once tormented with a longing for their country, and inflamed witha desire to be revenged on their enemies, they immediately ransomedthe prisoners and sent them back, after having settled the plan ofoperation, and agreed upon the signals which were to be given at adistance and observed by them. They then went themselves to Scipio toSyracuse, with whom some of the exiles were; and having, by relatingto him the promises made by the prisoners, inspired the consul withhopes which seemed likely to be realized, Marcus Sergius and PubliusMatienus, military tribunes, were sent with them, and ordered tolead three thousand soldiers from Rhegium to Locri. A letter was alsowritten to Quintus Pleminius, the propraetor, with directions that heshould assist in the business. The troops, setting out from Rhegiumand carrying with them ladders to suit the alleged height of thecitadel, about midnight gave a signal to those who were to betray itfrom the place agreed upon. The latter were ready and on the watch,and having themselves also lowered down ladders made for the purpose,and received the Romans as they climbed up in several places at once,an attack was made upon the Carthaginian sentinels, who were fastasleep, as they were not afraid of any thing of the kind before anynoise was made. Their dying groans were the first sound that washeard; then, awaking from their sleep, a sudden consternation andconfusion followed, the cause of the alarm being unknown. At length,one rousing another, the fact became more certain, and now every oneshouted ""To arms"" with all his might; ""that the enemy were in thecitadel and the sentinels slain;"" and the Romans, who were farinferior in numbers, would have been overpowered, had not a shoutraised by those who were outside of the citadel rendered it uncertainwhence the noise proceeded, while the terror of an alarm by nightmagnified all fears, however groundless. The Carthaginians, therefore,terrified and supposing that the citadel was already filled withthe enemy, gave up all thoughts of opposition and fled to the othercitadel; for there were two at no great distance from each other. Thetownsmen held the city, which lay between the two fortresses, as theprize of the victors. Slight engagements took place daily from thetwo citadels. Quintus Pleminius commanded the Roman, Hamilcar theCarthaginian garrison. They augmented their forces by calling in aidsfrom the neighbouring places. At last Hannibal himself came; nor wouldthe Romans have held out, had not the general body of the Locrians,exasperated by the pride and rapacity of the Carthaginians, leanedtowards the Romans."Book 29,Chapter 7,"When Scipio received intelligence that the posture of affairsat Locri had become more critical, and that Hannibal himself wasapproaching, lest even the garrison might be exposed to danger; forit was not an easy matter for it to retire thence; as soon as thedirection of the tide in the strait had changed, he let the shipsdrive with the tide from Messana, having left his brother, LuciusScipio, in command there. Hannibal also sent a messenger in advancefrom the river Butrotus, which is not far from the town of Locri, todesire his party to attack the Romans and Locrians at break of day inthe most vigorous manner, while he on the opposite side assaulted thetown, which would be unprepared for such a measure, as every onewould have his attention occupied with the tumult created in the otherquarter. But when, as soon as it was light, he found that the battlehad commenced, he was unwilling to shut himself up in the citadel,where, by his numbers, he would crowd that confined place; nor hadhe brought with him scaling-ladders to enable him to mount the walls.Having, however, had the baggage thrown together in a heap, anddisplayed his line at a distance from the walls to intimidate theenemy, while the scaling-ladders and other requisites for an assaultwere preparing, he rode round the city with some Numidian horsemen, inorder to observe in what quarter the attack might be best made. Havingadvanced towards the rampart, the person who happened to stand nexthim was struck by a weapon from a scorpion; and, terrified at anaccident in which he had been exposed to so much danger, he retired,gave directions for sounding a retreat, and fortified a camp outof the reach of weapons. The Roman fleet from Messana came to Locriseveral hours before night. The troops were all landed and had enteredthe city before sun-set. The following day the fight began from thecitadel on the part of the Carthaginians, and Hannibal, having nowprepared ladders and all the other requisites for an assault, wascoming up to the walls; when, throwing open the gate, the Romanssuddenly sallied out upon him, Hannibal fearing nothing less than sucha step. They slew as many as two hundred in the attack, having takenthem by surprise. The rest Hannibal withdrew into the camp when hefound the consul was there; and having despatched a messenger to thosewho were in the citadel, to desire them to take measures for theirown safety, he decamped by night. Those who were in the citadel also,after throwing fire upon the buildings they occupied, in order thatthe alarm thus occasioned might detain their enemy, went away witha speed which resembled flight, and overtook the body of their armybefore night."Book 29,Chapter 8,"Scipio, seeing that the citadel was abandoned by the enemy, andtheir camp deserted, called the Locrians to an assembly and rebukedthem severely for their defection. He inflicted punishment on thepersons principally concerned, and gave their effects to the leadersof the other party, in consideration of their extraordinary fidelityto the Romans. As to the Locrians in general, he said that he wouldneither grant them any thing, nor take any thing from them. They mightsend ambassadors to Rome, and they should experience that treatmentwhich the senate thought proper to adopt. Of one thing, however, hesaid he was confident, which was, that although they had deserved illat the hands of the Romans, they would be better off when subject tothem, though incensed against them, than they had been when in thepower of their friends the Carthaginians. Leaving Quintus Pleminiuslieutenant-general, and the garrison which had taken the citadel todefend the city, the general himself crossed over to Messana with theforces he had brought with him. The Locrians had been treated withsuch insolence and cruelty by the Carthaginians since their revoltfrom the Romans, that they were able to endure severities of anordinary kind not only with patience but almost willingness. Butindeed, so greatly did Pleminius surpass Hamilcar, who had commandedthe garrison, so greatly did the Roman soldiers in the garrisonsurpass the Carthaginians in villany and rapacity, that it wouldappear that they endeavoured to outdo each other, not in arms, but invices. None of all those things which render the power of a superiorhateful to the powerless was omitted towards the inhabitants, eitherby the general or his soldiers. The most shocking insults werecommitted against their own persons, their children, and their wives,For their rapacity did not abstain from the spoliation even ofsacred things; and not only were other temples violated, but eventhe treasures of Proserpine, which had never been touched throughall ages, excepting that they were said to have been carried away byPyrrhus, who restored the spoils, together with a costly offering inexpiation of his sacrilege. Therefore, as on the former occasion,the royal ships, wrecked and shattered, brought nothing safe to land,except the sacred money of the goddess, which they were carrying away;so now also, that same money, by a different kind of calamity, cast aspirit of madness upon all who were contaminated by this violationof the temple, and turned them against each other with the fury ofenemies, general against general, and soldier against soldier."Book 29,Chapter 9,"Pleminius had the chief command; that part of the soldiers which hehad brought with him from Rhegium were under his own command, the restwere under the command of the tribunes. One of Pleminius's men, whilerunning away with a silver cup which he had stolen from the house ofa townsman, the owners pursuing him, happened to meet Sergius andMatienus, the military tribunes. The cup having been taken away fromhim at the order of the tribunes, abuse and clamour ensued, and atlast a fight arose between the soldiers of Pleminius and those of thetribunes; the numbers engaged and the tumult increasing at the sametime, as either party was joined by their friends who happened to comeup at the time. When the soldiers of Pleminius, who had been worsted,had run to him in crowds, not without loud clamouring and indignantfeelings, showing their blood and wounds, and repeating the reproacheswhich had been heaped upon him during the dispute, Pleminius, firedwith resentment, flung himself out of his house, ordered the tribunesto be summoned and stripped, and the rods to be brought out.During the time which was consumed in stripping them, for they maderesistance, and implored their men to aid them, on a sudden thesoldiers, flushed with their recent victory, ran together from everyquarter, as if there had been a shout to arms against enemies; andwhen they saw the bodies of their tribunes now mangled with rods, thenindeed, suddenly inflamed with much, more ungovernable rage, withoutrespect, not only for the dignity of their commander, but of humanity,they made an attack upon the lieutenant-general, having firstmutilated the lictors in a shocking manner; they then cruellylacerated the lieutenant-general himself, having cut him off from hisparty and hemmed him in, and after mutilating his nose and earsleft him almost lifeless. Accounts of these occurrences arriving atMessana, Scipio, a few days after, passing over to Locri in a shipwith six banks of oars, took cognizance of the cause of Pleminius andthe tribunes. Having acquitted Pleminius and left him in command ofthe same place, and pronounced the tribunes guilty and thrown theminto chains, that they might be sent to Rome to the senate, hereturned to Messana, and thence to Syracuse. Pleminius, unableto restrain his resentment, for he thought that the injury he hadsustained had been treated negligently and too lightly by Scipio, andthat no one could form an estimate of the punishment which ought tobe inflicted in such a case, except the man who had in his own personfelt its atrocity, ordered the tribunes to be dragged before him, andafter lacerating them with every punishment which the human bodycould endure, put them to death; and not satisfied with the punishmentinflicted on them while alive, cast them out unburied. The likecruelty he exercised towards the Locrian nobles, whom he heard hadgone to Scipio to complain of the injuries he had done them. Thehorrid acts, prompted by lust and rapacity, which he had beforeperpetrated upon his allies, he now multiplied from resentment; thusbringing infamy and odium, not only upon himself, but upon the generalalso."Book 29,Chapter 10,"The time of the elections was now drawing near, when a letter fromthe consul Publius Licinius arrived at Rome, stating that ""he himselfand his army were afflicted with a severe sickness, nor could theyhave stood their ground had not the malady attacked the enemy with thesame or even greater violence. Therefore, as he could not comehimself to the election, he would, with the approbation of the senate,nominate Quintus Caecilius Metellus dictator, for the purpose ofholding the election. That it was for the interest of the state thatthe army of Quintus Caecilius should be disbanded; for that it couldnot be made any use of under present circumstances, for Hannibal hadnow withdrawn his troops into winter quarters; and so violent wasthe malady which had infected that camp, that unless it was speedilybroken up, there would not survive one man out of the whole army.""The senate left it to the consul to settle these matters, as he shoulddeem consistent with the interest of the state and his own honour.The state was at this time suddenly occupied with a question of areligious nature, in consequence of the discovery of a predictionin the Sibylline books, which had been inspected on account ofthere having been so many showers of stones this year. It ran thus:""Whensoever a foreign enemy should bring war into the land of Italy,he may be driven out of Italy and conquered, if the Idaean Mothershould be brought from Pessinus to Rome."" This prophecy, discoveredby the decemviri, produced the greater impression upon the senate,because ambassadors also, who had carried a present to Delphi, hadbrought word back, that they had both obtained a favourable appearancein sacrificing to the Pythian Apollo, and that a response wasdelivered from the oracle, to the effect, that a much greater victorythan that from the spoils of which they now brought presents, awaitedthe Roman people. They considered the presentiment which existed inthe mind of Publius Scipio, with regard to the termination of thewar, when he claimed Africa as his province, as corroborating the sameanticipation. In order, therefore, that they might the more speedilyput themselves in possession of victory, which was portended to themby the fates, omens, and oracles, they began to think what methodcould be adopted for conveying the goddess to Rome."Book 29,Chapter 11,"As yet the Roman people had none of the states of Asia in alliancewith them. Recollecting, however, that formerly Aesculapius, onaccount of a sickness among the people, was fetched from Greece, whichwas not then united with them by any treaty; recollecting, also, thata friendship had already commenced between them and king Attalus, onaccount of the war which they waged in common against Philip, andthat he would do whatever he could to oblige the Roman people, theyresolved to send, as ambassadors to him, Marcus Valerius Laevinus, whohad been twice consul, and had carried on operations in Greece; MarcusCaecilius Metellus, who had been praetor; Servius Sulpicius Galba,who had been aedile; and two who had been quaestors, Caius TremelliusFlaccus and Marcus Valerius Falto. To these five quinqueremes wereassigned, in order that, in a manner suitable to the dignity of theRoman people, they might visit those lands where it was importantto gain respect for the Roman name. The ambassadors, on their wayto Asia, having landed at Delphi, immediately approached the oracle,inquiring what hopes the deity held out to themselves and the Romanpeople, of accomplishing the business for which they had been sentfrom home. It is said that the answer given was, ""that they wouldobtain what they were seeking by means of king Attalus. When they hadconveyed the goddess to Rome, they must take care that the best man atRome should receive her to his hospitality."" They came to Pergamus tothe king, who received the ambassadors graciously, and conducted themto Pessinus in Phrygia, and putting into their hands a sacred stone,which the inhabitants said was the mother of the gods, bid them conveyit to Rome. Marcus Valerius Falto, who was sent in advance, broughtword that the goddess was on her way, and that the most virtuous manin the state must be sought out, who might in due form receive andentertain her. Quintus Caecilius Metellus was nominated dictator forholding the elections, by the consul in Bruttium, and his army wasdisbanded. Lucius Veturius Philo was made master of the horse. Theelections were held by the dictator; the consuls elected were MarcusCornelius Cethegus and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus, who was absent,being engaged in his province of Greece. The praetors were thenelected: Titus Claudius Nero, Marcus Marcius Ralla, Lucius ScriboniusLibo, Marcus Pomponius Matho. On the conclusion of the elections, thedictator abdicated his office. The Roman games were repeated thrice,the plebeian seven times. The curule aediles were Cneius and LuciusCornelius Lentulus: Lucius had the province of Spain; he was electedin his absence, and was absent while he filled the office. Theplebeian aediles were Titus Claudius Asellus and Marcus Junius Pennus.Marcus Marcellus this year dedicated the temple of Virtue at the PortaCapena, in the seventeenth year after it had been vowed by his fatherduring his first consulate at Clastidium in Gaul: also Marcus AemiliusRegillus, flamen of Mars, died this year."Book 29,Chapter 12,"For the last two years the affairs of Greece had been neglected.Accordingly, as the Aetolians were deserted by the Romans, on whomalone they depended for assistance, Philip compelled them to sue forand agree to a peace on whatever conditions he pleased. Had he notexerted himself to the utmost in expediting this measure, he wouldhave been overpowered, while engaged in war with the Aetolians,by Publius Sempronius, the proconsul, who had been sent to succeedSulpicius in the command, with ten thousand infantry and a thousandhorse, together with thirty-five ships of war, a force of no smallimportance to bring to the assistance of allies. Ere the peace waswell concluded, news was brought to the king that the Romans hadarrived at Dyrrachium; that the Parthinians, and other borderingnations, were up in arms on seeing hopes of effecting a change; andthat Dimallum was besieged. The Romans had turned their efforts tothat quarter instead of assisting the Aetolians, for which purposethey had been sent, from resentment at the conduct of the Aetoliansfor making peace with the king without their sanction, contrary to theleague. When Philip had received intelligence of these events, lestany greater commotion should arise in the neighbouring nations andstates, he proceeded by forced marches to Apollonia, to which placeSempronius had retired, having sent Laetorius, his lieutenant-general,with a part of his forces and fifteen ships into Aetolia, to look intothe state of affairs, and, if he could, dissolve the peace. Philiplaid waste the lands of the Apollonians, and, advancing his troops tothe tower, offered the Romans battle. But seeing that they remainedquiet, only defending the walls, and not having sufficient confidencein his strength to assault the town, being desirous also of makingpeace with the Romans if possible, as he had with the Aetolians, orat least a truce, he withdrew into his own dominions, without furtherexciting their animosity by a fresh contest. During the same timethe Epirots, wearied by the long continuance of the war, having firstsounded the disposition of the Romans, sent ambassadors to Philip onthe subject of a common peace; affirming that they were well satisfiedthat it might be arranged if he would come to a conference withPublius Sempronius, the Roman general. They easily prevailed on him topass into Epirus, for neither were the king's own inclinations aversefrom this measure. Phoenice is a city of Epirus; here Philip firstconferred with Aeropus Dardas and Philip, praetors of the Epirots, andafterwards met Publius Sempronius. Amynander, king of the Athamanians,and other magistrates of the Epirots and Acarnanians, were present atthe conference. The praetor Philip spoke first, and requested at onceof the king and the Roman general, that they would put an end to thewar, and grant this boon to the Epirots. Publius Sempronius proposedas the conditions of the peace, that the Parthinians, and Dimallum,and Bargulum, and Eugenium, should be under the dominion of theRomans; that Atintania, if on sending ambassadors to Rome they couldprevail upon the senate to acquiesce, should be added to the dominionsof the Macedonian. The peace having been agreed upon on theseterms, Prusias king of Bithynia, the Achaeans, the Boeotians, theThessalians, the Acarnanians, and the Epirots, were included inthe treaty by the king; by the Romans, the Ilians, king Attalus,Pleuratus, Nabis tyrant of the Lacedaemonians, the Eleans, theMessenians, and Athenians. These conditions were committed to writingand sealed; and a truce was agreed upon for two months, to allow timefor ambassadors being sent to Rome, that the people might order thepeace upon these terms. All the tribes agreed in ordering it, becausenow that the operations of the war were removed into Africa, they weredesirous to be relieved for the present from all other wars. The peacebeing concluded, Publius Sempronius took his departure for Rome, toattend to the duties of his consulship."Book 29,Chapter 13,"To Publius Sempronius and Marcus Cornelius, the consuls in thefifteenth year of the Punic war, the provinces assigned were, toCornelius, Etruria, with the old army; to Sempronius, Bruttium, withdirections to levy fresh legions. Of the praetors, to Marcus Marciusfell the city jurisdiction; to Lucius Scribonius Libo, the foreign,together with Gaul; to Marcus Pomponius Matho, Sicily; to TitusClaudius Nero, Sardinia. Publius Scipio was continued in commandwith the army and fleet which he had under him, as was also PubliusLicinius, with directions to occupy Bruttium with two legions, so longas the consul should deem it for the advantage of the state thathe should continue in the province with command. Marcus Livius andSpurius Lucretius were also continued in command, with the two legionswith which they had protected Gaul against Mago; also Cneius Octavius,with orders that, after he had delivered up Sardinia and the legionto Titus Claudius, he should, with forty ships of war, protect thesea-coast within such limits as the senate should appoint. To MarcusPomponius, the praetor in Sicily, the troops which had fought atCannae, consisting of two legions, were assigned. It was decreed, thatTitus Quinctius and Caius Tubulus, propraetors, should occupy, theformer Tarentum, the latter Capua, as in the former year, each havinghis old army. With respect to the command in Spain, it was submittedto the people to decide on the two proconsuls to be sent into thatprovince. All the tribes agreed in ordering that the same persons,namely, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus, should,as proconsuls, hold the command of those provinces as they had theformer year. The consuls set about making the levies, both to raisenew legions for Bruttium, and recruit the other armies; for so werethey directed by the senate."Book 29,Chapter 14,"Although Africa had not as yet been openly declared a province,the senate keeping it a secret, I suppose, lest the Carthaginiansshould get intelligence of it beforehand, nevertheless, the mostsanguine hopes were entertained in the city, that the enemy would bevanquished that year in Africa, and that the termination of the Punicwar was at hand. This circumstance had filled the minds of the peoplewith superstitious notions, and they were strongly disposed to creditand propagate accounts of prodigies, and for that reason more werereported. It was said, ""that two suns had been seen; that it hadbecome light for a time during the night; that at Setia a meteor hadbeen seen, extending from the east to the west; that at Tarracina agate, at Anagnia a gate and the wall in many places, had been struckby lightning; that in the temple of Juno Sospita, at Lanuvium, a noisehad been heard, accompanied with a tremendous crash."" There was asupplication for one day for the purpose of expiating these, andthe nine days' sacred rite was celebrated on account of a shower ofstones. In addition to these cares, they had to deliberate about thereception of the Idaean Mother; for besides that Marcus Valerius, oneof the ambassadors who had come before the rest, had brought word thatshe would be in Italy forthwith a recent account had arrived that shewas at Tarracina. The senate was occupied with the determination of amatter of no small importance, namely, who was the most virtuous manin the state. Every one doubtless would wish for himself the victoryin this contest, rather than any office of command, or any honours,which could be conferred by the suffrages either of the senate or thepeople. Publius Scipio, son of Cneius who had fallen in Spain, a youthnot yet of the age to be quaestor, they adjudged to be the best of thegood men in the whole state. Though I would willingly record it forthe information of posterity, had the writers who lived in the timesnearest to those events mentioned by what virtues of his they wereinduced to come to this determination, yet I will not obtrude my ownopinion, formed upon conjecture, relative to a matter buried in theobscurity of antiquity. Publius Cornelius was ordered to go to Ostia,attended by all the matrons, to meet the goddess; to receive her fromthe ship himself, and, when landed, place her in the hands of thematrons to convey her away. After the ship arrived at the mouth of theTiber, Scipio, according to the directions given him, sailed out intothe open sea, and, receiving the goddess from the priests, conveyedher to land. The chief matrons in the state received her, among whomthe name of Claudia Quinta alone is worthy of remark. Her fame,which, as it is recorded, was before that time dubious, became,in consequence of her having assisted in so solemn a business,illustrious for chastity among posterity. The matrons, passing herfrom one to another in orderly succession, conveyed the goddess intothe temple of Victory, in the Palatium, on the day before the ides ofApril, which was made a festival, while the whole city poured out tomeet her; and, placing censers before their doors, on the way by whichshe was conveyed in procession, kindled frankincense, and prayedthat she would enter the city of Rome willingly and propitiously. Thepeople in crowds carried presents to the goddess in the Palatium; alectisternium was celebrated, with games called the Megalesian."Book 29,Chapter 15,"When the business of recruiting the legions in the provinces wasunder consideration, it was suggested by certain senators that now wasthe time, when, by the favour of the gods, their fears were removed,to put a stop to certain things, however they might have beentolerated in perilous circumstances. The senators, being intent inexpectation, subjoined, that the twelve Latin colonies which hadrefused to furnish soldiers to the consuls, Quintus Fabius andQuintus Fulvius, were enjoying, for now the sixth year, exemptionfrom military service, as though it had been granted to them a markof honour and favour; while in the mean time their good and dutifulallies, in return for their fidelity and obedience to the Romanpeople, had been exhausted by continual levies every year. By thesewords the recollection of the senate was renewed touching a matterwhich was now almost obliterated, and their indignation equallyexcited. Accordingly, without allowing the consuls to lay any otherbusiness before the senate in priority, they decreed, ""that theconsuls should summon to Rome the magistrates, and ten principalinhabitants, from each of the colonies, Xepete, Sutrium, Ardea, Cales,Alba, Carseoli, Sora, Suessa, Setia, Circeii, Narnia, and Interamna;for these were the colonies implicated in this affair; and commandthem that each of those colonies should furnish double the greatestnumber of foot soldiers which they had ever provided for the Romanpeople since the enemy had been in Italy, and one hundred and twentyhorsemen each. If any of them was unable to make up that number ofhorsemen, that it should be allowed to furnish three foot soldiers forevery horseman deficient. That both the foot and horse soldiers shouldbe chosen from the wealthiest of the inhabitants, and should be sentout of Italy wheresoever there was want of recruits. If any of themrefused to comply, it was their pleasure that the magistrates andambassadors of such should be detained; and that, if they requestedit, they should not be allowed an audience of the senate till they hadobeyed these orders. Moreover, that an annual tax should be imposedupon them, and collected after the rate of one _as_ for everythousand; and that a census should be taken in those colonies,according to a formula appointed by the Roman censors, which should bethe same which was employed in the case of the Roman people; and thata return should be made at Rome by sworn censors of the colonies,before they retired from their office."" The magistrates and principalmen of these colonies having been summoned to Rome, when the consulsimposed upon them the contribution of men, and the management of thetax, they vied with each other in making excuses, and remonstratingagainst it. They said ""it was impossible that so large a number of mencould be raised. That they could scarcely accomplish it, if even thesimple contribution only, according to the established ratio, wererequired of them. They entreated and besought them that they might beallowed to appear before the senate and deprecate their resolution.They had committed no crime for which they deserved to be ruined;but, even if they were to be ruined, neither their own crime northe resentment of the Roman people could make them furnish a greaternumber of soldiers than they had got."" The consuls, persisting,ordered the ambassadors to remain at Rome, and the magistrates togo home to make the levies; observing, that ""unless the amount ofsoldiers enjoined were brought to Rome, no one would give them anaudience of the senate."" All hope of appearing before the senate,and deprecating their decision, being then cut off, the levies werecompleted in the twelve colonies without difficulty, as the number oftheir youth had increased during their long exemption from service."Book 29,Chapter 16,"Another affair, likewise, which had been passed over in silencefor an almost equally long period, was laid before the senate byMarcus Valerius Laevinus; who said, ""that equity required that themonies which had been contributed by private individuals, when heand Marcus Claudius were consuls, should now at length be repaid. Norought any one to feel surprised that a case, where the public faithwas pledged, should have engaged his attention in an especial manner;for, besides that the matter appertained, in some degree, peculiarlyto the consul of that year in which the money was contributed, he washimself the author of the measure, as the treasury was drained, andthe people unable to pay the taxes."" This suggestion was well receivedby the senate, and, bidding the consuls to propose the question, theydecreed, ""that this money should be paid by three instalments; thatthe present consuls should make the first payment immediately, and thethird and fifth consuls, from that time, the two remaining.""After this, all their other cares gave place to one alone when thesufferings of the Locrians, of which they had been ignorant up to thatday, were made known by the arrival of their ambassadors. Nor was itthe villany of Pleminius so much as the partiality or negligence ofScipio in that affair, which excited the resentment of the people.While the consuls were sitting in the comitium, ten ambassadors of theLocrians, covered with filth, and in mourning, and extending branchesof olive, the badges of suppliants, according to the Grecian custom,prostrated themselves on the ground before the tribunal, with loudlamentations. In answer to the inquiry of the consuls, they said,""that they were Locrians, who had suffered such things at the hands ofPleminius the lieutenant-general, and the Roman soldiers, as theRoman people would not wish even the Carthaginians to experience. Theyrequested that they would allow them to appear before the senate, andcomplain of their sufferings."""Book 29,Chapter 17,"An audience having been granted, the eldest of them thus spoke:""I know, conscript fathers, that the importance you will attach tothe complaints we make before you must depend, in a very great degree,upon your accurately knowing the manner in which Locri was betrayed toHannibal, and placed again under your dominion after the expulsion ofhis garrison. Inasmuch as if the guilt of defection does not restupon the public, and it is made apparent that our restoration to yourdominion was effected, not only in concurrence with our wishes, but byour own co-operation and valour, you will be the more indignant thatsuch atrocious and shameful injuries should have been inflicted upongood and faithful allies by your lieutenant-general and soldiers.But I think it proper that the subject of our changing sides, in bothinstances, should be deferred to another time, on two accounts: first,that it may be discussed in the presence of Publius Scipio, whoretook Locri, and who witnessed all our acts, both good and bad; andsecondly, because, whatever we are, we ought not to have sufferedwhat we have. We cannot conceal, conscript fathers, that when we hada Carthaginian garrison in our citadel we were exposed to manysufferings, of a shocking and shameful kind, from Hamilcar, thecaptain of the garrison, and the Numidians and Africans. But whatare they compared with what we endure this day? I request, conscriptfathers, that you will hear without offence what I am reluctant tomention. All mankind are now in a state of anxious suspense, whetherthey are to see you or the Carthaginians lords of the world. If anestimate is to be formed of the Roman and Carthaginian governmentsfrom what we Locrians have suffered from the Carthaginians on the onehand, or on the other, from what we are suffering, at the present timeespecially, from your garrison; there is no one who would not wishthe Carthaginians to be his masters rather than the Romans. And yetobserve what are the feelings which the Locrians have entertainedtowards you. When we were suffering injuries of much less magnitudefrom the Carthaginians, we fled for protection to your general; nowwe are suffering more than hostile indignities from your garrison, wehave carried our complaints to no others than yourselves. Conscriptfathers! either you will consider our forlorn condition or there isno other resource left us for which we can even pray to the immortalgods. Quintus Pleminius, the lieutenant-general, was sent with a bodyof troops to recover Locri from the Carthaginians, and was left therein command of the same as a garrison. In this your lieutenant-generalthere is neither any thing of a man, conscript fathers, but the figureand outward appearance, (for the extremity of our misery prompts me tospeak freely,) nor of a Roman citizen, but the attire and dress, andthe sound of the Latin language. He is a pest and savage monster, suchas are fabled to have beset the strait by which we are separatedfrom Sicily, for the destruction of mariners. And yet if he had beencontent to be the only person to vent his villany, his lust, andrapacity upon your allies, that one gulf, deep as it was, we wouldhowever have filled up by our patience. But the case is, he hasmade every one of your centurions and soldiers a Pleminius, soindiscriminately has he willed that licentiousness and wickednessshould be practised. All plunder, spoil, beat, wound, and slay; alldefile matrons, virgins, and free-born youths torn from the embracesof their parents. Our city is captured daily, plundered daily. Dayand night, every place indiscriminately rings with the lamentations ofwomen and children, seized and carried away. Any one, acquainted withour sufferings, might be astonished how it is that we are capable ofbearing them, or that the authors of them are not yet satiated withinflicting such enormous cruelties. Neither am I able to go throughwith them, nor is it worth your while to listen to the particulars ofour sufferings. I will embrace them all in a general description.I declare that there is not a house or a man at Locri exempt frominjury. I say that there cannot be found any species of villany, lust,or rapacity which has not been exercised on every one capable of beingthe object of them. It would be difficult to determine in which casethe city was visited with the more horrible calamity, whether when itwas captured by an enemy, or when a sanguinary tyrant crushed itby violence and arms. Every evil, conscript fathers, which capturedcities suffer, we have suffered, and do now as much as ever suffer.All the enormities which the most cruel and savage tyrants are wontto perpetrate upon their oppressed subjects, Pleminius has perpetratedupon ourselves, our children, and our wives."Book 29,Chapter 18,"""There is one circumstance, however, in complaining of whichparticularly we may be allowed to yield to our deeply-rooted sense ofreligion, and indulge a hope that you will listen to it; and, if itshall seem good to you, conscript fathers, free your state fromthe guilt of irreligious conduct. For we have seen with how greatsolemnity you not only worship your own deities, but entertain eventhose of foreign countries. We have a fane dedicated to Proserpine, ofthe sanctity of which temple I imagine some accounts must have reachedyou, during the war with Pyrrhus; who, when sailing by Locri, on hisreturn from Sicily, among other horrid enormities which he committedagainst our state, on account of our fidelity towards you, plunderedalso the treasures of Proserpine, which had never been touched up tothat day; and then, putting the money on board his ships, proceededon his journey himself by land. What, therefore, was the result,conscript fathers? The next day his fleet was shattered by a mosthideous tempest, and all the ships which carried the sacred money werethrown on our shores. That most insolent king, convinced by thisso great disaster that there were gods, ordered all the money to becollected and restored to the treasures of the goddess. However, henever met with any success afterwards; but, after being driven out ofItaly, he died an ignoble and dishonourable death, having incautiouslyentered Argos by night. Though your lieutenant-general and militarytribune had heard of these, and a thousand other circumstances, whichwere related not for the purpose of creating increased reverence, butfrequently experienced by ourselves and our ancestors, through thespecial interposition of the goddess, they had, nevertheless,the audacity to apply their sacrilegious hands to those hallowedtreasures, and pollute themselves, their own families, and yoursoldiers, with the impious booty. Through whom we implore you,conscript fathers, by your honour, not to perform any thing in Italyor in Africa, until you have expiated their guilty deed, lest theyshould atone for the crime they have committed, not with their ownblood only, but by some disaster affecting their country. Although,even now, conscript fathers, the resentment of the goddess does nottarry either towards your generals or your soldiers. Already have theyseveral times engaged each other in pitched battles, one party headedby Pleminius, and the other by the two military tribunes. Never didthey employ their weapons with more fury against the Carthaginiansthan when encountering each other; and they would have affordedHannibal an opportunity of retaking Locri, had not Scipio, whom wecalled in, come in time to prevent it. But, by Hercules, is it thatthe soldiers are impelled by frenzy, and that the influence of thegoddess has not shown itself in punishing the generals themselves?Nay, herein her interposition was manifested in the most conspicuousmanner. The tribunes were beaten with rods by the lieutenant-general.Then the lieutenant-general, treacherously seized by the tribunes,besides being mangled in every part of his body, had his nose and earscut off, and was left for dead. Then, recovering from his wounds, hethrew the tribunes into chains; beat them, tortured them with everyspecies of degrading punishment, and put them to death in a cruelmanner, forbidding them to be buried. Such atonements has the goddessexacted from the despoilers of her temple; nor will she cease topursue them, with every species of vengeance, till the sacred moneyshall have been replaced in the treasury. Formerly, our ancestors,during a grievous war with the Crotonians, because the temple waswithout the town, were desirous of removing the money into it; but avoice was heard from the shrine, during the night, commanding them tohold off their hands, for the goddess would defend her own temple.As they were deterred, by religious awe, from removing the treasuresthence, they were desirous of surrounding the temple with a wall. Thewalls were raised to a considerable height, when they suddenly felldown in ruins. But, both now, and frequently on other occasions, thegoddess has either defended her own habitation and temple, or hasexacted heavy expiations from those who had violated it. Our injuriesshe cannot avenge, nor can any but yourselves avenge them, conscriptfathers. To you, and to your honour, we fly, as suppliants. It makesno difference to us whether you suffer Locri to be subject to thatlieutenant-general and that garrison, or whether you deliver us upfor punishment to incensed Hannibal and the Carthaginians. We donot request that you should at once believe us respecting one who isabsent, and when the cause has not been heard. Let him come; let himhear our charges in person, and refute them himself. If there is anyenormity one man can commit against another which he has not committedupon us we do not refuse to suffer all the same cruelties over again,if it is possible we can endure them, and let him be acquitted of allguilt towards gods and men."""Book 29,Chapter 19,"When the ambassadors had thus spoken, and Quintus Fabius had askedthem whether they had carried those complaints to Publius Scipio, theyanswered, ""that deputies were sent to him, but he was occupied withthe preparations for the war, and had either already crossed overinto Africa, or was about to do so within a few days. That they hadexperienced how highly the lieutenant-general was in favour with thegeneral, when, after hearing the cause between him and thetribunes, he threw the tribunes into chains, while he left thelieutenant-general, who was equally or more guilty, in possession ofthe same power as before."" The ambassadors, having been directed towithdraw from the senate-house, not only Pleminius, but even Scipio,was severely inveighed against by the principal men; but, above all,by Quintus Fabius, who endeavoured to show, ""that he was born for thecorruption of military discipline. It was thus,"" he said, ""that inSpain he almost lost more men in consequence of mutiny than thewar. That, after the manner of foreigners and kings, he indulged thelicentiousness of the soldiers, and then punished them with cruelty.""He then followed up his speech by a resolution equally harsh: that ""itwas his opinion, that Pleminius should be conveyed to Rome in chains,and in chains plead his cause; and, if the complaints of the Locrianswere founded in truth, that he should be put to death in prison, andhis effects confiscated. That Publius Scipio should be recalled, forhaving quitted his province without the permission of the senate; andthat the plebeian tribunes should be applied to, to propose to thepeople the abrogation of his command. That the senate should reply tothe Locrians, when brought before them, that the injuries which theycomplained of having received were neither approved of by the senatenor the people of Rome. That they should be acknowledged as worthymen, allies, and friends; that their children, their wives, andwhatsoever else had been taken from them, should be restored; thatthe sum of money which had been taken from the treasures of Proserpineshould be collected, and twice the amount placed in the treasury. Thatan expiatory sacred rite should be celebrated, first referring it tothe college of pontiffs, to determine what atonements should be made,to what gods, and with what victims, in consequence of the sacredtreasures' having been removed and violated. That the soldiers atLocri should be all transported into Sicily, and four cohorts of theallies of the Latin confederacy taken to Locri for a garrison."" Thevotes could not be entirely collected that day in consequence of thewarm feeling excited for and against Scipio. Besides the atrociousconduct of Pleminius, and the calamities of the Locrians, much wassaid about the dress of the general himself, as being not only notRoman, but even unsoldierlike. It was said, that ""he walked about inthe gymnasium in a cloak and slippers, and that he gave his time tolight books and the palaestra. That his whole staff were enjoyingthe delights which Syracuse afforded, with the same indolence andeffeminacy. That Carthage and Hannibal had dropped out of his memory;that the whole army, corrupted by indulgence, like that at Sucro inSpain, or that now at Locri, was more to be feared by its allies thanby its enemies."""Book 29,Chapter 20,"Though these charges, partly true, and partly containing a mixtureof truth and falsehood, and therefore, probably, were urged withvehemence; the opinion, however, of Quintus Metellus prevailed, who,agreeing with Maximus on other points, differed from him in the caseof Scipio. ""For how inconsistent would it be,"" said he, ""that theperson whom the state a little while ago selected as their general,though a very young man, for the recovery of Spain; whom, after hehad taken Spain out of the hands of their enemies, they elected theirconsul, for the purpose of putting an end to the Punic war; whom theymarked out with the most confident anticipation as the person whowould draw Hannibal out of Italy, and subdue Africa; how inconsistentwould it be, that this man, like another Pleminius, condemned ina manner without a hearing, should suddenly be recalled from hisprovince! when the Locrians asserted that the wicked acts which hadbeen committed against them were done not even in the presence ofScipio, and no other charge could be brought against him, than that hespared the lieutenant-general, either from good nature or respect. Hethought it advisable, that Marcus Pomponius the praetor, to whose lotthe province of Sicily had fallen, should go to his province withinthe next three days; that the consuls should select out of the senateten deputies, whomsoever they thought proper, and send them with thepraetor, together with two tribunes of the people, and an aedile. Thatthe praetor, assisted by this council, should take cognizance of theaffair. If those acts of which the Locrians complained were committedat the command or with the concurrence of Scipio, that they shouldcommand him to quit the province. If Publius Scipio had alreadycrossed over into Africa, that the tribunes of the people and theaedile, with two of the deputies, whom the praetor should judge mostfit for it, should proceed into Africa; the tribunes and the aedile tobring Scipio back from thence, and the deputies to take the command ofthe army until a new general had come to it. But if Marcus Pomponiusand the ten deputies should discover that those acts had beencommitted neither with the orders nor concurrence of Publius Scipio,that Scipio should then remain with the army and carry on the war ashe had proposed."" A decree of the senate having passed to this effect,application was made to the tribunes of the people to arrange amongthemselves, or determine by lot, which two should go with the praetorand the deputies. The advice of the college of pontiffs was taken onthe subject of the expiations to be made, on account of the treasuresin the temple of Proserpine, at Locri, having been touched, violated,and carried out of it. The tribunes of the people, who went with thepraetor and ten deputies, were Marcus Claudius Marcellus and MarcusCincius Alimentus. To these a plebeian aedile was given, whom, ifScipio, whether he was still in Sicily or had now crossed over intoAfrica, should refuse to obey the orders of the praetor, the tribunesmight direct to apprehend him, and bring him home in right of theirmost sacred authority. The plan was, to go to Locri before they wentto Messana."Book 29,Chapter 21,"With regard to Pleminius, there are two different accounts. Somerelate that, having heard what measures had been adopted at Rome,as he was going into exile to Naples, he accidentally fell in withQuintus Metellus, one of the deputies, by whom he was forciblyconveyed back to Rhegium. Others say, that Scipio himself sent alieutenant-general with thirty of the most distinguished of thecavalry to throw Quintus Pleminius into chains, and with him theprincipal movers of the mutiny. All these, whether by the ordersof Scipio before, or of the praetor now, were delivered over to theRhegians to be kept in custody. The praetor and the deputies going toLocri, gave their attention first to the affair relating to religion,agreeably to their instructions; for, collecting all the sacred money,whether in the possession of Pleminius or the soldiers, they replacedit in the treasury, together with that which they had brought withthem, and performed an expiatory sacred rite. The praetor then,summoning the soldiers to an assembly, ordered them to march out ofthe city, and pitched a camp in the plain, issuing an edict whichthreatened severe punishment to any soldier who either had remainedbehind in the city, or had carried out with him what did not belong tohim. He gave permission to the Locrians to seize whatever each of themidentified as his property, and demand restitution to be made of anything which was concealed. Above all, he was resolved that the freepersons should be restored to the Locrians without delay. That the manwho did not restore them should be visited with no light punishment.He then held an assembly of the Locrians, and told them, that ""thepeople and senate of Rome restored to them their liberty and theirlaws. That if any one was desirous of bringing charges againstPleminius, or any one else, he should follow them to Rhegium. If theywere desirous of complaining, in the name of their state, of PubliusScipio, as having ordered and approved of the nefarious acts which hadbeen committed at Locri against gods and men, that they should senddeputies to Messana, where, with the assistance of his council, hewould hear them."" The Locrians returned thanks to the praetor anddeputies, and to the senate and people of Rome, and said that theywould go and bring their charge against Pleminius. That Scipio, thoughhe had evinced too little sympathy in the injuries inflicted on theirstate, was such a man as they would rather have their friend thantheir enemy; that they were convinced that the many and horrid actswhich had been committed were done neither by the orders nor withthe approval of Publius Scipio; that he had either placed too muchconfidence in Pleminius, or too little in them; that the naturaldisposition of some men was such, that they rather were unwilling thatcrimes should be committed, than had sufficient resolution to punishthem when committed. Both the praetor and his council were relievedfrom a burden of no ordinary weight in not having to take cognizanceof charges against Scipio. Pleminius, and as many as thirty-twopersons with him, they condemned and sent in chains to Rome. Theythen proceeded to Scipio, that they might carry to Rome a statementattested by their own observation relative to the facts which had beenso generally talked of, concerning the dress and indolent habits ofthe general, and the relaxation of military discipline."Book 29,Chapter 22,"While they were on their way to Syracuse, Scipio prepared to clearhimself, not by words but facts. He ordered all his troops to assemblethere, and the fleet to be got in readiness, as though a battle hadbeen to be fought that day with the Carthaginians, by sea and land.On the day of their arrival he entertained them hospitably, and on thenext day presented to their view his land and naval forces, not onlydrawn up in order, but the former performing evolutions, while thefleet in the harbour itself also exhibited a mock naval fight.The praetor and the deputies were then conducted round to view thearmouries, the granaries, and other preparations for the war. And sogreat was the admiration excited in them of each particular, and ofthe whole together, that they firmly believed, that under the conductof that general, and with that army, the Carthaginians would bevanquished, or by none other. They bid him, with the blessing ofthe gods, cross over, and, as soon as possible, realize to the Romanpeople the hopes they conceived on that day when all the centuriesconcurred in naming him first consul. Thus they set out on theirreturn in the highest spirits, as though they were about to carry toRome tidings of a victory, and not of a grand preparation for war.Pleminius, and those who were implicated in the same guilt with him,when they arrived at Rome, were thrown immediately into prison. Atfirst, when brought before the people by the tribunes, they found noplace in their compassion, as their minds were previously engrossedby the sufferings of the Locrians; but afterwards, being repeatedlybrought before them, and the hatred with which they were regardedsubsiding, their resentment was softened. Besides, the mutilatedappearance of Pleminius, and their recollections of the absent Scipio,operated in gaining them favour with the people. Pleminius, however,died in prison, before the people had come to a determinationrespecting him. Clodius Licinius, in the third book of his Romanhistory, relates, that this Pleminius, during the celebration of thevotive games, which Africanus, in his second consulate, exhibitedat Rome, made an attempt, by means of certain persons whom he hadcorrupted by bribes, to set fire to the city in several places, thathe might have an opportunity of breaking out of prison, and making hisescape; and that afterwards, the wicked plot having been discovered,he was consigned to the Tullian dungeon, according to a decree of thesenate. The case of Scipio was considered no where but in thesenate; where all the deputies and tribunes, bestowing the highestcommendations on the fleet, the army, and the general, induced thesenate to vote that he should cross over into Africa as soon aspossible; and that permission should be given him to select himself,out of those armies which were in Sicily, those forces which he wouldcarry with him into Africa, and those which he would leave for theprotection of the province."Book 29,Chapter 23,"While the Romans were thus employed, the Carthaginians, on theirpart, though they had passed an anxious winter, earnestly inquiringwhat was going on, and terrified at the arrival of every messenger,with watch-towers placed on every promontory, had gained a point of nosmall importance for the defence of Africa, in adding to their alliesking Syphax, in reliance on whom chiefly they believed the Romanswould cross over into Africa. Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, not only formeda connexion of hospitality with the before-named king, when Scipio andHasdrubal happened to come to him at the same time out of Spain,but mention had also been slightly made of an affinity to take placebetween them, by the king's marrying the daughter of Hasdrubal.Hasdrubal, who had gone for the purpose of completing thisbusiness, and fixing a time for the nuptials, for the virgin was nowmarriageable, perceiving that the king was inflamed with desire, forthe Numidians are, beyond all the other barbarians, violently addictedto love, sent for the virgin from Carthage, and hastened the nuptials.Among the other proofs of joy felt upon the occasion, and in orderthat a public connexion might be added to this private one, an oathwas taken in confirmation of an alliance between the Carthaginianpeople and the king, and faith reciprocally pledged that they wouldhave the same friends and enemies. But Hasdrubal, recollecting boththe alliance which had been entered into by the king and Scipio, andhow inconstant and changeable were the minds of the barbarians, wasafraid that, if Scipio were to invade Africa, that marriage wouldprove but a slight bond of union, he therefore took advantage of theNumidian while under the influence of the first transports of love,and calling to his aid the caresses of the bride, prevailed upon himto send ambassadors into Sicily to Scipio, and by them to warn him""not to cross over into Africa in reliance upon his former promises.That he was united to the Carthaginians both by a marriage witha Carthaginian citizen, the daughter of Hasdrubal, whom he sawentertained at his house, and likewise by a public treaty. Thathis first wish was that the Romans would carry on the war with theCarthaginians at a distance from Africa, as they had hitherto done,lest he should be compelled to interfere with their disputes, and joinone of the two contending parties, renouncing his alliance with theother. If Scipio should not keep away from Africa, and should advancehis army to Carthage, it would be incumbent upon him to fight forthe land of Africa, which gave him birth, and for the country of hisspouse, for her parent, and household gods."""Book 29,Chapter 24,"The ambassadors, sent to Scipio by the king with theseinstructions, met him at Syracuse. Scipio, though disappointed inan affair which was of the greatest importance with regard to hisoperations in Africa, and in the sanguine expectations he had formedfrom it, sent the ambassadors back into Africa speedily, before theirbusiness was made known, giving them letters for the king, in which hewarned him over and over again ""not to violate the laws of hospitalitywhich bound them together; the obligation of the alliance entered intowith the Roman people; nor make light of justice, honour, theirright hands pledged, and the gods the witnesses and arbitrators ofcompacts."" But, as the coming of the Numidians could not be concealed,for they lounged about the city, and had frequently appeared at thepavilion; and as, if nothing were said about the object of theirvisit, there was danger lest the truth, from the very circumstance ofits being made a secret, should spontaneously spread the more; and, inconsequence, the troops become alarmed lest they should have to wagewar at once with the king and the Carthaginians, Scipio endeavoured todivert their attention from the truth by preoccupying their minds withfalse information; and, summoning his soldiers to an assembly, said,""that it was not expedient to delay any longer. That the kings, theirallies, urged them to cross over into Africa with all speed. ThatMasinissa himself had before come to Laelius, complaining thattime was consumed in delays, and that now Syphax sent ambassadors,expressing his astonishment on the same account, namely, what couldbe the cause of such long delay; and requesting either that the armywould now at length be transported into Africa, or, if the plan waschanged, that he might be informed so that he might himself takemeasures for the safety of himself and his dominions. Therefore, asevery thing was now ready and prepared, and as the business admittedof no further delay, he was resolved, after having removed the fleetto Lilybaeum, and collected here all his forces of foot and horse,with the blessing of the gods to pass over into Africa the first daythe ships could sail."" He sent a letter to Marcus Pomponius, directinghim, if he thought proper, to come to Lilybaeum, that they mightconsult together as to what legions, in preference to any others, andhow large a number of soldiers, they should convey into Africa; healso sent round to every part of the sea-coast, with directions thatall the ships of burthen should be seized and collected at Lilybaeum.When all the soldiers and ships in Sicily were assembled at Lilybaeum,and neither the city could contain the multitude of men, nor theharbour the ships, so ardent was the desire possessed by all ofpassing over to Africa, that they did not appear as if going to wagewar, but to reap the certain rewards of victory. Particularly thosewho remained of the soldiers who had fought at Cannae felt convincedthat under Scipio, and no other general, they would be enabled, byexerting themselves in the cause of the state, to put an end to theirignominious service. Scipio was very far from feeling contempt forthat description of soldiers, inasmuch as he knew that the defeatsustained at Cannae was not attributable to their cowardice, and thatthere were no soldiers in the Roman army who had served so long, orwere so experienced not only in the various kinds of battles, but inassaulting towns also. The legions which had fought at Cannae werethe fifth and sixth. After declaring that he would take these with himinto Africa, he inspected them man by man; and leaving those whom heconsidered unfit for service, he substituted for them those whom hehad brought from Sicily, filling up those legions so that each mightcontain six thousand two hundred infantry and three hundred horse. Thehorse and foot of the allies, of the Latin confederacy, he also choseout of the army of Cannae."Book 29,Chapter 25,"There is a wide difference among historians as to the number ofmen transported into Africa. In some I find ten thousand infantry andtwo hundred horse; in others, sixteen thousand infantry and sixteenhundred horse. In others, again, I find it stated that thirty-fivethousand infantry and cavalry were put on board the fleet, making thenumber more than one half greater. Some have not added an account ofthe number; among whom, as the matter is doubtful, I should ratherhave myself ranked. Caelius, though he abstains from specifying thenumber, increases the impression of their multitude indefinitely. Hesays, that birds fell to the ground from the shout of the soldiers,and that so great a multitude went on board the fleet, that it seemedas if there was not a man left in Italy or Sicily. Scipio took uponhimself the care of seeing that the soldiers embarked orderly andwithout confusion. The seamen, who were made to embark first, CaiusLaelius, the admiral of the fleet, kept in order on board the ships.The task of the putting on board the provisions was assigned to MarcusPomponius, the praetor. Food for forty-five days, of which enough forfifteen was cooked, was put on board. When they were all embarked, hesent boats round with directions that the pilots and masters, withtwo soldiers from each ship, should assemble in the forum to receiveorders. After they had assembled, he first asked them whether they hadput on board water for the men and cattle, sufficient to last as manydays as the corn would. When they answered that there was water onboard sufficient for five and forty days' consumption, he then chargedthe soldiers that, conducting themselves submissively, and keepingquiet, they would not make any noise or disturb the mariners in theexecution of their duties. He informed them, that he himself andLucius Scipio in the right wing, with twenty ships of war, and CaiusLaelius, admiral of the fleet, together with Marcus Porcius Cato, whowas then quaestor, with the same number of ships of war in the leftwing, would protect the transports. That the ships of war should carryeach a single light, the transports two each. That in the ship of thecommander-in-chief there would be three lights as a distinction bynight. He desired the pilots to make for Emporia, where the land isremarkably fertile; and on that account the district abounds withplenty of every thing, and the barbarous inhabitants are unwarlike,which is usually the case where the soil is rich. It was supposedthat they might, therefore, be overpowered before assistance could bebrought them from Carthage. After these commands were delivered, theywere ordered to return to their ships, and the next day, with theblessing of the gods, on the signal being given, to set sail."Book 29,Chapter 26,"Many Roman fleets had set sail from Sicily, and from that veryharbour. But not only during this war, nor is that surprising, (formost of the fleets went out for the purpose of getting plunder,) buteven in any former war, never did a fleet on setting out exhibitso grand a spectacle. And yet, if the estimate is to be formed withreference to the magnitude of the fleet, it must be owned that twoconsuls with their armies had passed from thence before, and therewere almost as many ships of war in those fleets as the transportswith which Scipio was crossing. For, besides fifty men of war, heconveyed his army over in four hundred transports. But what made theRomans consider one war as more formidable than the other, the secondthan the first, was, that it was carried on in Italy, and that so manyarmies had been destroyed, and their commanders slain. The general,Scipio, also, who enjoyed the highest degree of renown, partlyfrom his brave achievements, and partly from a peculiar felicity offortune, which conducted him to the acquisition of boundless glory,attracted extraordinary regard. At the same time, the very project ofpassing over into the enemy's country, which had not been formedby any general before during that war, had made him an object ofadmiration; for he had commonly declared, that he passed over with theobject of drawing Hannibal out of Italy, of removing the seat of warinto Africa, and terminating it there. A crowd of persons of everydescription had assembled in the harbour to view the spectacle; notonly the inhabitants of Lilybaeum, but all the deputies from Sicily,who had come together out of compliment to witness the departureof Scipio, and had followed Marcus Pomponius, the praetor of theprovince. Besides these, the legions which were to be left in Sicilyhad come forth to do honour to their comrades on the occasion; and notonly did the fleet form a grand sight to those who viewed it from theland, but the shore also, crowded as it was all around, afforded thesame to those who were sailing away."Book 29,Chapter 27,"As soon as day appeared, silence having been obtained by a herald,Scipio thus spoke from the ship of the commander-in-chief: ""Ye godsand goddesses who preside over the seas and lands, I pray and entreatyou, that whatever things have been, are now, or shall be performedduring my command, may turn out prosperously to myself, the state, andcommons of Rome, to the allies and the Latin confederacy, and toall who follow my party and that of the Roman people, my command andauspices, by land, by sea, and on rivers. That you would lend yourfavourable aid to all those measures, and promote them happily. Thatyou would bring these and me again to our homes, safe and unhurt;victorious over our vanquished enemies, decorated with spoils, loadedwith booty, and triumphant. That you would grant us the opportunity oftaking revenge upon our adversaries and foes, and put it in the powerof myself and the Roman people to make the Carthaginian state feelthose signal severities which they endeavoured to inflict upon ourstate."" After these prayers, he threw the raw entrails of a victiminto the sea, according to custom, and, with the sound of a trumpet,gave the signal for sailing. Setting out with a favourable wind, whichblew pretty strong, they were soon borne away out of sight of theland; and in the afternoon a mist came over them, so that they couldwith difficulty prevent the ships from running foul of each other. Thewind abated when they got into the open sea. The following night thesame haziness prevailed; but when the sun rose it was dispelled, andthe wind blew stronger. They were now within sight of land, and, notlong after, the pilot observed to Scipio, that ""Africa was not morethan five miles off; that he could discern the promontory of Mercury,and that if he gave orders to direct their course thither, the wholefleet would presently be in harbour."" Scipio, when the land was insight, after praying that his seeing Africa might be for the goodof the state and himself, gave orders to make for another place oflanding, lower down. They were borne along by the same wind; but amist, arising nearly about the same time as on the preceding day, hidthe land from them; and the wind fell as the mist grew more dense.Afterwards, the night coming on increased the confusion in everyrespect; they therefore cast anchor, lest the ships should eitherrun foul of each other, or be driven on shore. At daybreak the wind,rising in the same quarter, dispelled the mist and discovered thewhole coast of Africa. Scipio asked what was the name of the nearestpromontory, and, on being told that it was called the cape of Pulcher,he observed, ""the omen pleases me, direct your course to it."" Tothis place the fleet ran down, and all the troops were landed. I haveadopted the accounts given by a great many Greek and Latin authors,who state that the voyage was prosperous, and unattended with anycause of alarm or confusion. Caelius alone, except that he does notstate that the ships were sunk in the waves, says that they wereexposed to all the terrors of the heavens and the sea, and thatat last the fleet was driven by tempest from Africa to the islandAegimurus, from which, with great difficulty, they got into the rightcourse; and that, the ships almost foundering, the soldiers, withoutorders from their general, got into boats, just as if they hadsuffered shipwreck, and escaped to land without arms, and in theutmost disorder."Book 29,Chapter 28,"The troops being landed, the Romans marked out their camp on thenearest rising grounds. By this time, not only the parts bordering onthe sea were filled with consternation and alarm, first in consequenceof the fleet being seen, and afterwards from the bustle of landing,but they had extended to the cities also. For not only multitudes ofmen, mixed with crowds of women and children, had filled up all theroads in every direction, but the rustics also drove away their cattlebefore them, so that you would say that Africa was being suddenlydeserted. In the cities, indeed, they occasioned much greater terrorthan they felt themselves. At Carthage, particularly, the tumult wasalmost as great as if it had been captured. For since the time ofMarcus Atilius Regulus and Lucius Manlius, which was almost fiftyyears ago, the Carthaginians had seen no Roman armament, with theexception of fleets sent for plundering, from which troops had madedescents upon the lands bordering on the sea, and after carrying awayevery thing which chance threw in their way, had always returned totheir ships before their noise had collected the peasantry. For thisreason the hurry and consternation in the city was, on the presentoccasion, the greater. And, by Hercules, they had neither an efficientarmy at home, nor a general, whom they could oppose to their enemy.Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, was by far the first man in their state inrespect of birth, fame, opulence, and, at that time, also by reasonof an affinity with the king. But they recollected that he had beenrouted in several battles and driven out of Spain by this very Scipio;and that therefore, as a general, he was no more a match for thegeneral of the enemy than their tumultuary army was for that of theRomans. Therefore they shouted to arms, as if Scipio were comingimmediately to attack the city; the gates were hastily closed, armedmen placed upon the walls, guards and outposts stationed in differentplaces, and the following night was spent in watching. The next day,five hundred horsemen, sent to the coast to reconnoitre and interruptthe enemy while landing, fell in with the advanced guards of theRomans; for by this time Scipio, having sent his fleet to Utica, hadproceeded a short distance from the sea, and occupied the nearestheights. He had also placed outposts of cavalry in proper situations,and sent troops through the country to plunder."Book 29,Chapter 29,"These, engaging the body of Carthaginian horse, slew a few of themin the fight, and the greater part of them as they pursued them whenthey were flying; among whom was Hanno, their captain, a young man ofdistinction. Scipio not only devastated the lands in the countryround him, but also took a very wealthy city of the Africans which laynearest to him; where, besides other things which were immediatelyput on board the transports and sent into Sicily, eight thousand freepersons and slaves were captured. But the most gratifying circumstanceto the Romans was, the arrival of Masinissa just at the commencementof their operations. Some say that he came with not more than twohundred horse, but most authors say with a body of two thousandcavalry. But, as this man was by far the greatest king of his age, andrendered most essential service to the Romans, it seems worth while todigress a little, to give a full account of the great vicissitudesof fortune he experienced in the loss and recovery of his father'skingdom. While he was serving in Spain in the cause of theCarthaginians, his father, named Gala, died. The kingdom, according tothe custom of the Numidians, came to Oesalces, the brother of thelate king, who was very aged. Not long after, Oesalces also dying,the elder of his two sons, named Capusa, the other being quite a boy,succeeded to his father's kingdom. But, as he occupied the throne moreby right of descent than from the esteem in which he was held amonghis countrymen, or the power he possessed, there stood forth a personnamed Mezetulus, not unrelated by blood to the kings, of a familywhich had always been hostile to them, and had continually contestedthe right to the throne with those who then occupied it, with varioussuccess. This man, having roused his countrymen to arms, over whom hepossessed a great influence, from the hatred felt towards the kings,openly pitched his camp, and compelled the king to come into the fieldand fight for the throne. Capusa, with many of his nobles, falling inthe action, the whole nation of the Massylians came under the dominionand rule of Mezetulus. He abstained, however, from assuming thetitle of king; and, contenting himself with the modest appellationof protector, gave the name of king to the boy Lacumaces, a survivingbranch of the royal stock. In the hope of an alliance with theCarthaginians, he formed a matrimonial connexion with a nobleCarthaginian lady, daughter of Hannibal's sister, who had been latelymarried to the king Oesalces; and, sending ambassadors for thatpurpose, renewed an old connexion of hospitality with Syphax, takingall these measures with a view to obtain assistance against Masinissa."Book 29,Chapter 30,"Masinissa, hearing of the death of his uncle, and afterwards thathis cousin-german was slain, passed over out of Spain into Mauritania.Bocchar was king of the Moors at that time. Applying to him as asuppliant, he succeeded, by means of the most humble entreaties, inobtaining from him four thousand Moors to escort him on his march,since he could not procure his co-operation in the war. With these,after sending a messenger before him to his own and his father'sfriends, he arrived on the frontiers of the kingdom, when about fivehundred Numidians came to join him. Having, therefore, sent back theMoors to their king, as had been agreed, though the numbers whichjoined him were much less than he had anticipated, not being such asto inspire him with sufficient confidence for so great an attempt,yet, concluding that by action, and by making some effort, he shouldcollect sufficient strength to enable him to effect something, hethrew himself in the way of the young king Lacumaces, at Thapsus, ashe was going to Syphax. The troops which attended him having fled backto the town in consternation, Masinissa took it at the first assault.Of the royal party, some who surrendered themselves he received,others he slew while attempting resistance. The greater part, with theyoung king himself, escaped during the confusion and came to Syphax,to whom they intended to go at first. The fame of this success, inthe commencement of his operations, though of no great magnitude,brought the Numidians over to the cause of Masinissa; and the veteransoldiers of Gala flocked to his standard from all quarters, from thecountry and the towns, inviting the youth to come and recover hispaternal dominions. Mezetulus had somewhat the advantage in the numberof his soldiers, for he had himself both the army with which he hadconquered Capusa, and also some troops who had submitted to him afterthe king was slain; and the young king Lacumaces had brought him verylarge succours from Syphax. Mezetulus had fifteen thousand infantry,and ten thousand cavalry. With these Masinissa engaged in battle,though he had by no means so many horse or foot. The valour, however,of the veteran troops, and the skill of the general, who had beenexercised in the war between the Romans and Carthaginians, prevailed.The young king, with the protector and a small body of Massylians,escaped into the territories of the Carthaginians. Masinissa thusrecovered his paternal dominions; but, as he saw that there stillremained a struggle considerably more arduous with Syphax, he thoughtit advisable to come to a reconciliation with his cousin-german.Having, therefore sent persons to give the young king hopes, that ifhe put himself under the protection of Masinissa, he would be held inthe same honour by him as Oesalces had formerly been by Gala; and topromise Mezetulus, in addition to impunity, a faithful restitutionof all his property; as both of them preferred a moderate shareof fortune at home to exile, he brought them over to his side,notwithstanding the Carthaginians studiously exerted every means toprevent it."Book 29,Chapter 31,"It happened that Hasdrubal was with Syphax at the time thesethings were taking place. He told the Numidian, who considered that itcould make very little difference to him whether the government of theMassylians was in the hands of Lacumaces or Masinissa, that ""he wasvery much mistaken if he supposed that Masinissa would be content withthe same power which his father Gala or his uncle Oesalces enjoyed.That he possessed a much greater degree of spirit, and a moreenterprising turn of mind, than had ever existed in any one of thatrace. That he had frequently, when in Spain, exhibited proofs to hisallies, as well as to his enemies, of such valour as was rarelyfound among men. That both Syphax and the Carthaginians, unless theysmothered that rising flame, would soon find themselves enveloped ina vast conflagration, when they could not help themselves. That as yethis strength was feeble, and such as might easily be broken, whilehe was trying to keep together a kingdom, which was not yet firmlycemented."" By continually urging and goading him on, he succeeded ininducing him to lead an army to the frontiers of the Massylians, andto pitch his camp in a country for which he had not only disputedverbally, but had fought battles with Gala, as though it had been hisown by uncontested right. He alleged, that ""if any one should attemptto dislodge him, which was what he most wanted, he would have anopportunity of fighting; but, if the ground were given up to himthrough fear, he must march into the heart of the kingdom. That theMassylians would either submit to his authority without a contest,or would be inferior to him in arms."" Syphax, impelled by thesearguments, made war on Masinissa, and, in the first engagement, routedand put him to flight. Masinissa, with a few horsemen, effected hisescape from the field to a mountain called by the natives Balbus.Several families, with their tents and cattle, which form theirwealth, followed the king; the rest of the Massylian people submittedto Syphax. The mountain, which the exiles had seized, had plentyof grass and water; and, as it was well adapted for feeding cattle,afforded an abundant supply of food for men who live upon flesh andmilk. From this place they infested all the surrounding country; atfirst with nightly and clandestine incursions, but afterwards withopen depredations. The lands of the Carthaginians suffered theseverest devastation, because there was not only a greater quantityof booty there than among the Numidians, but their plunder would besafer. And now they did it with so much boldness and defiance, that,carrying their booty down to the sea, they sold it to merchants, whobrought their ships to land for that very purpose; while a greaternumber of Carthaginians were slain and made prisoners, than frequentlyhappens in a regular war. The Carthaginians complained bitterly ofthese occurrences to Syphax, and urged him strongly to follow up thisremnant of the war, though he was himself highly incensed at them. Buthe considered it hardly suitable to the dignity of a king to pursue avagabond robber through the mountains."Book 29,Chapter 32,"Bocchar, one of the king's generals, an enterprising and activeofficer, was chosen for this service. Four thousand infantry andtwo thousand cavalry were assigned him; and having been loaded withpromises of immense rewards if he brought back the head of Masinissa,or if, which would be a source of incalculable joy, he took him alive;he unexpectedly attacked his party while dispersed and carelesslyemployed, and after cutting off an immense quantity of cattle and menfrom the troops which guarded them, drove Masinissa himself witha small body of attendants to the summit of the mountain. On this,considering the business as in a manner settled, he not only sent thebooty of cattle and the prisoners he had made to the king, but alsosent back a part of his forces, as being considerably more than werenecessary to accomplish what remained of the war; and then pursuingMasinissa, who had come down from the top of the mountain with notmore than five hundred foot and two hundred horse, shut him up in anarrow valley, both the entrances of which he blocked up. Here greatslaughter was made of the Massylians. Masinissa, with not more thanfifty horsemen, disengaged himself from the defile by passing throughsteep descents of the mountains, which were not known to his pursuers.Bocchar, however, followed close upon him, and overtaking him in theopen plains near Clupea, so effectually surrounded him, that he slewevery one of his attendants except four horsemen. These, together withMasinissa himself, who was wounded, he let slip, in a manner, out ofhis hands during the confusion. The fugitives were in sight, anda body of horse, dispersed over the whole plain, pursued the fivehorsemen of the enemy, some of them pushing off in an obliquedirection, in order to meet them. The fugitives met with a very broadriver, into which they unhesitatingly plunged their horses, as theywere pressed by greater danger from behind, and carried away by thecurrent were borne along obliquely. Two of them having sunk in therapid eddy in the sight of the enemy, Masinissa himself was supposedto have perished; but he with the two remaining had emerged among thebushes on the farther bank. Here Bocchar stopped his pursuit, as heneither had courage to enter the river, nor believed that he now hadany one to pursue. Upon this he returned to the king, with the falseaccount of the death of Masinissa. Messengers were despatched toCarthage to convey this most joyful event, and all Africa rang withthe news of Masinissa's death; but the minds of men were variouslyaffected by it. Masinissa, while curing his wound by the applicationof herbs, was supported for several days in a secret cave by what thetwo horsemen procured by plunder. As soon as it was cicatrized, and hethought himself able to bear the motion, with extraordinary resolutionhe set out to recover his kingdom; and collecting not more than fortyhorsemen during his progress, when he arrived among the Massylians,where he now made himself known, he produced such a sensation amongthem, both by reason of their former regard for him, and also from theunhoped-for joy they experienced at seeing him safe whom they supposedto have perished, that within a few days six thousand armed foot andfour thousand horse came and joined him; and now he not only was inpossession of his paternal dominions, but was also laying wastethe lands of the states in alliance with the Carthaginians, and thefrontiers of the Massylians, the dominions of Syphax. Then, havingprovoked Syphax to war, he took up a position between Cirta and Hippo,on the tops of mountains which were conveniently situated for all hispurposes."Book 29,Chapter 33,"Syphax, considering this an affair of too great importance to bemanaged by one of his generals, sent a part of his army with his sonVermina, a youth, with orders to march his troops round and attack theenemy in the rear, while he engaged their attention in front. Verminaset out by night, as he was to fall upon the enemy unawares; butSyphax decamped in the day-time and marched openly, intending to fighta pitched battle. When it was thought that sufficient time had elapsedfor those who were sent round to have reached their destination,Syphax himself, relying upon his numbers and on the ambuscade preparedon the enemy's rear, led his troops up the mountain which lay beforehim, by a gentle acclivity which led towards the enemy. Masinissa,relying chiefly on the great superiority he would have over hisopponents in respect of the ground, on his part also formed histroops. The battle was furious, and for a long time doubtful;Masinissa having the advantage in point of situation and the courageof his troops, and Syphax in respect of his numbers, which were muchthe greater of the two. His numerous troops, which were divided, someof them pressing upon the enemy in front, while others surrounded themon the rear, gave Syphax a decisive victory; and, enclosed as theywere in front and rear, the enemy had not even a way to escape.Accordingly, all their troops, both horse and foot, were slain andmade prisoners, except about two hundred horsemen, which Masinissahaving collected round him in a compact body, and divided into threesquadrons, ordered to force their way through, first naming a placewhere they were to meet after being separated in their flight.Masinissa himself escaped through the midst of the enemy's weapons inthe quarter to which he had directed his course; two of the squadronswere unable to extricate themselves; one of them surrendered to theenemy through fear, the other, taking a more obstinate resistance, wasoverwhelmed with weapons and annihilated. Vermina followed Masinissa,treading almost in his steps; but he eluded him by continually turningout of one road into another, till at length he obliged him, weariedwith the hopeless task, to desist from the pursuit, and arrived at theLesser Syrtis with sixty horsemen. Here, in the country lying betweenthe Carthaginian Emporia and the nation of the Garamantians, he passedall the time till the coming of Caius Laelius and the Roman fleet intoAfrica, with the proud consciousness of having made every exertionto recover his paternal dominions. These are the circumstances whichincline me to the opinion, that afterwards also, when Masinissa cameto Scipio, he brought with him a smallish rather than a large body ofcavalry to succour him; for the large number would seem to suitonly with the condition of a reigning king, while the small numbercorresponds with the circumstances of an exile."Book 29,Chapter 34,"The Carthaginians having lost a detachment of cavalry togetherwith the commander, got together another body by means of a new levy,and gave the command of it to Hanno son of Hamilcar. They frequentlysent for Hasdrubal and Syphax by letters and messengers, and lastlyeven by ambassadors, ordering Hasdrubal to bring assistance to hisalmost besieged country, and imploring Syphax to bring relief toCarthage, nay to all Africa. At that time Scipio had his camp aboutfive miles from the city of Utica, having removed it from the sea,where he had continued encamped for a few days near the fleet. Hanno,having received the body of horse, which was far from being strongenough, not only to attack the enemy, but even to protect the countryfrom devastation, made it his first business to augment the numberof his cavalry by pressing; and though he did not despise the men ofother nations, he enlisted principally from the Numidians, who are byfar the first horsemen in Africa. He had now as many as four thousandhorsemen, when he took possession of a town named Salera, aboutfifteen miles from the Roman camp. When Scipio was told of this, hesaid, ""What! cavalry lodging in houses during the summer! Let them beeven more in number while they have such a leader."" Concluding thatthe more dilatory they were in their operations, the more active heought to be, he sent Masinissa forward with the cavalry, directing himto ride up to the gates of the enemy and draw them out to battle; andwhen their whole force had poured out and pressed upon him with suchimpetuosity in the contest that they could not easily be withstood,then to retire by degrees, and he would himself come up and joinin the battle in time. Waiting only till he thought he had allowedsufficient time for the advanced party to draw out the enemy, hefollowed with the Roman cavalry, proceeding without being seen, ashe was covered by some rising grounds, which lay very convenientlybetween him and the enemy, round the windings of the road. Masinissa,according to the plan laid down, at one time as if menacingthe enemy,at another as if he had been afraid, either rode up to the gates, orelse by retiring when his counterfeited fears had inspired them withcourage, tempted them to pursue him with inconsiderate ardour. Theyhad not as yet all gone out, and the general was wearying himself withvarious occupations, compelling some who were oppressed with sleep andwine to take arms and bridle their horses, and preventing others fromrunning out at all the gates in scattered parties and in disorder,without keeping their ranks or following their standards. At first,those who incautiously rushed out were overpowered by Masinissa; butthen a greater number pouring out of the gate at once in a dense body,placed the contest on an equal footing; and at last the whole of theircavalry coming up and joining in the battle, they could now no longerbe withstood. Masinissa, however, did not receive their charge inhasty flight, but retired slowly, until he drew them to the risinggrounds which covered the Roman cavalry. The Roman cavalry then risingup, their own strength unimpaired and their horses fresh, spreadthemselves round Hanno and the Africans, fatigued with the fight andthe pursuit, and Masinissa, suddenly turning his horses round, cameback to the battle. About a thousand who formed the first line andcould not easily retreat, together with Hanno their general, weresurrounded and slain. The victors pursuing the rest through a spaceof three miles, as they fled with the most violent haste, beingterrified, principally on account of the death of their leader, eithertook or slew as many as two thousand horsemen more. It appeared thatthere were not less than two hundred Carthaginian horsemen among them,some of whom were distinguished by birth and fortune."Book 29,Chapter 35,"It happened that the same day on which these events occurred,the ships which had carried the plunder to Sicily returned withprovisions, as if divining that they came to take another cargo ofbooty. All the writers do not vouch for the fact that two generals ofthe Carthaginians bearing the same name were slain in the battles ofthe cavalry; fearing, I believe, lest the same circumstance relatedtwice should lead them into error. Caelius, indeed, and Valerius, makemention of a Hanno also who was made prisoner. Scipio rewarded hisofficers and horsemen according to the service they had respectivelyrendered, but he presented Masinissa above all the rest withdistinguished gifts. Leaving a strong garrison at Salera, he set outwith the rest of his army; and having not only devastated the countrywherever he marched, but taken some cities and towns, thus spreadingthe terrors of war far and wide, he returned to his camp on theseventh day after he set out, bringing with him an immense quantityof men and cattle, and booty of every description, and sent away hisships again loaded with the spoils of the enemy. Then giving up allexpeditions of a minor kind, and predatory excursions, he directed thewhole force of the war to the siege of Utica, that he might make itfor the time to come, if he took it, a position from which he mightset out for the execution of the rest of his designs. At one and thesame time his marines attacked the city from the fleet in that partwhich is washed by the sea, and the land forces were brought up from arising ground which almost immediately overhung the walls. He had alsobrought with him engines and machines which had been conveyed fromSicily with the stores, and fresh ones were made in the armoury, inwhich he had for that purpose employed a number of artificers skilledin such works. The people of Utica, thus beset on all sides with soformidable a force, placed all their hopes in the Carthaginians, andthe Carthaginians in the chance there was that Hasdrubal could induceSyphax to take arms. But all their movements were made too slowly forthe anxiety felt by those who were in want of assistance. Hasdrubal,though he had by levies, conducted with the utmost diligence, madeup as many as thirty thousand infantry and three thousand horse,yet dared not move nearer to the enemy before the arrival of Syphax.Syphax came with fifty thousand foot and ten thousand horse, and,immediately decamping from Carthage, took up a position not far fromUtica and the Roman works. Their arrival produced, however, thiseffect, that Scipio, who had been besieging Utica for forty days,during which he had tried every expedient without effect, left theplace without accomplishing his object; and as the winter was now fastapproaching, fortified a camp for the winter upon a promontory, whichbeing attached to the continent by a narrow isthmus, stretched out aconsiderable way into the sea. He included his naval camp also withinone and the same rampart. The camp for the legions being stationed onthe middle of the isthmus, the ships, which were drawn on land, andthe mariners occupied the northern shore, the cavalry a valley on thesouth inclining towards the other shore. Such were the transactions inAfrica up to the close of autumn."Book 29,Chapter 36,"Besides the corn collected from all parts of the surroundingcountry by plunder, and the provisions imported from Italy and Sicily,Cneius Octavius, propraetor, brought a vast quantity out of Sardiniafrom Tiberius Claudius the praetor, whose province Sardinia was; andnot only were the granaries already built filled, but new ones wereerected. The army wanted clothing, and Octavius was instructedto consult with the praetor in order to ascertain if any couldbe procured and sent out of that province. This business was alsodiligently attended to. One thousand two hundred gowns and twelvethousand tunics were in a short time sent. During the summer in whichthese operations were carried on in Africa, Publius Sempronius, theconsul, who had the province of Bruttium, fought an irregular kindof battle with Hannibal in the Crotonian territory while actually onmarch; they fought with their troops drawn more in order of march thanof battle. The Romans were driven back, and as many as twelve hundredof the army of the consul were slain in this affair, which was morea tumult than a battle. They returned in confusion to their camp. Theenemy, however, dared not assault it. But, during the silence of thefollowing night, the consul marched away, and having sent a messengerbefore him to Publius Licinius, the proconsul, to bring up hislegions, united his forces with his. Thus two generals and two armiesreturned to Hannibal. Nor did either party delay to fight, as theforces of the consul were doubled, and the Carthaginian was inspiritedby recent victory. Sempronius led his legions into the front line;those of Licinius were placed in reserve. The consul, in the beginningof the battle, vowed a temple to Fortuna Primigenia if he routedthe enemy that day, and he obtained the object of that vow. TheCarthaginians were routed and put to flight; above four thousand armedmen were slain, a little under three hundred taken alive, with fortyhorses and eleven military standards. Hannibal, dispirited by thisadverse battle, led his troops away to Croton. At the same time, inanother part of Italy, Etruria, almost the whole of which hadespoused the interest of Mago, and had conceived hopes of effectinga revolution through his means, was kept in subjection by the consulMarcus Cornelius, not so much by the force of his arms as the terrorof his judicial proceedings. In the trials he had instituted there,in conformity with the decree of the senate, he had shown the utmostimpartiality; and many of the Tuscan nobles, who had either themselvesgone, or had sent others to Mago respecting the revolt of theirstates, at first standing their trials, were condemned; but afterwardsothers, who, from a consciousness of guilt, had gone into voluntaryexile, were condemned in their absence, and by thus withdrawing lefttheir effects only, which were liable to confiscation, as a pledge fortheir punishment."Book 29,Chapter 37,"While the consuls were thus engaged in different quarters, in themean time, at Rome, the censors, Marcus Livius and Caius Claudius,called over the senate roll. Quintus Fabius was again chosen chief ofthe senate; seven were stigmatized, of whom there was not one who hadsat in the curule chair. They inquired into the business relating tothe repair of public edifices with diligence and the most scrupulousexactness. They set by contract the making of a road out of the oxmarket to the temple of Venus, with public seats on each side of it,and a temple to be built in the palatium for the great mother. Theyestablished also a new tax out of the price of salt. Salt, both atRome, and throughout all Italy, was sold at the sixth part of an _as_.They contracted for the supply of it at Rome at the same price, at ahigher price in the country towns and markets, and at differentprices in different places. They felt well convinced that this taxwas invented by one of the censors, out of resentment to the peoplebecause he had formerly been condemned by an unjust sentence, and thatin fixing the price of salt, those tribes had been most burdened bywhose means he had been condemned. Hence Livius derived the surnameof Salinator. The closing of the lustrum was later than usual, becausethe censors sent persons through the provinces, that a report might bemade of the number of Roman citizens in each of the armies. Includingthese, the number of persons returned in the census was two hundredand fourteen thousand. Caius Claudius Nero closed the lustrum. Theythen received a census of the twelve colonies, which had never beendone before, the censors of the colonies themselves presenting it,in order that there might appear registers among the public records,stating the extent of their resources, both in respect of furnishingsoldiers and money. The review of the knights then began to be made,and it happened that both the censors had a horse at the publicexpense. When they came to the Pollian tribe, in which was the nameof Marcus Livius, and the herald hesitated to cite the censor himself,Nero said, ""Cite Marcus Livius;"" and whether it was that he wasactuated by the remains of an old enmity, or that he felt a ridiculouspride in this ill-timed display of severity, he ordered Marcus Liviusto sell his horse, because he had been condemned by the sentence ofthe people. In like manner, when they came to the Narnian tribe, andthe name of his colleague, Marcus Livius ordered Caius Claudius tosell his horse, for two reasons; one, because he had given falseevidence against him; the other, because he had not been sincere inhis reconciliation with him. Thus a disgraceful contest arose, inwhich each endeavoured to asperse the character of the other, thoughnot without detriment to his own. On the expiration of the office,when Caius Claudius had taken the oath respecting the observance ofthe laws, and had gone up into the treasury, he gave the name ofhis colleague among the names of those whom he left disfranchised.Afterwards, Marcus Livius came into the treasury, and excepting onlythe Maecian tribe, which had neither condemned him nor made him consulor censor when condemned, left all the Roman people, four and thirtytribes, disfranchised, because they had both condemned him wheninnocent, and when condemned had made him consul and censor; andtherefore could not deny that they had been guilty of a crime, eitheronce in his condemnation, or twice at the elections. He said that thedisfranchisement of Caius Claudius would be included in that of thethirty-four tribes, but that if he were in possession of a precedentfor leaving the same person disfranchised twice he would have lefthis name particularly among the disfranchised. This contest betweencensors, endeavouring to brand each other, was highly improper, whilethe correction applied to the inconstancy of the people was suitableto the office of a censor, and worthy of the strict discipline ofthe times. As the censors were labouring under odium, Cneius Babius,tribune of the people, thinking this a favourable opportunity ofadvancing himself at their expense, summoned them both to trial beforethe people. This proceeding was quashed by the unanimous voice of thesenate, lest in future this office of censor should become subject tothe caprice of the people."Book 29,Chapter 38,"The same summer Clampetia in Bruttium was taken by the consul bystorm. Consentia and Pandosia, with some other inconsiderable states,submitted voluntarily. As the time for the elections was now drawingnear, it was thought best that Cornelius should be summoned to Romefrom Etruria, as there was no war there. He elected, as consuls,Cneius Servilius Caepio and Caius Servilius Geminus. The election ofpraetors was then held. The persons elected were, Publius CorneliusLentulus, Publius Quinctilius Varus, Publius Aelius Paetus, andPublius Villius Tappulus. The last two were plebeian aediles whenelected praetors. The elections finished, the consul returned intoEtruria to his army. The priests who died this year, and those whowere put in their places, were Tiberius Veturius Philo, flamen ofMars, elected and inaugurated in the room of Marcus Aemilius Regillus,who died the year before: in the room of Marcus Pomponius Matho,augur and decemvir, were elected Marcus Aurelius Cotta, decemvir, andTiberius Sempronius Gracchus, augur, being then a very young man;an instance of very rare occurrence in the disposal of the priests'offices in those times. Golden four-horsed chariots were placed thisyear in the Capitol by the curule aediles, Caius Livius and MarcusServilius Geminus. The Roman games were repeated during two days.During two days also the plebeian games were repeated by the aediles,Publius Aelius and Publius Villius. There was likewise a feast ofJupiter on occasion of the games."Book 30,Chapter 1,"Cneius Servilius and Caius Servilius Geminus, the consuls inthe sixteenth year of the Punic war, having consulted the senaterespecting the state, the war, and the provinces, they decreed thatthe consuls should arrange between themselves, or draw lots, which ofthem should have the province of Bruttium, to act against Hannibal,and which that of Etruria and Liguria; that the consul to whose lotBruttium fell should receive the army from Publius Sempronius; thatPublius Sempronius, who was continued in command as proconsul for ayear, should succeed Publius Licinius, who was to return to Rome. Inaddition to the other qualifications with which he was adorned ina degree surpassed by no citizen of that time, for in him wereaccumulated all the perfections of nature and fortune, Licinius wasalso esteemed eminent in war. He was at once a man of noble family andgreat wealth; possessing a fine person and great bodily strength.He was considered an orator of the highest order, both in respect ofjudicial eloquence, and also when engaged in promoting or opposing anymeasure in the senate, or before the people. He was alsoaccurately skilled in the pontifical law. In addition to all theserecommendations, the consulship enabled him to acquire military glory.The senate adopted the same course in the decree with respect to theprovince of Etruria and Liguria as had been observed with regard toBruttium. Marcus Cornelius was ordered to deliver his army to the newconsul, and with continued command to hold himself the province ofGaul, with those legions which the praetor Lucius Scribonius hadcommanded the former year. The consuls then cast lots for theirprovinces: Bruttium fell to the lot of Caepio, Etruria to the lot ofServilius Geminus. The provinces of the praetors were then put to thelot. Paetus Aelius obtained the city jurisdiction; Publius Lentulus,Sardinia; Publius Villius, Sicily; Quinctilius Varus, Ariminum, withtwo legions which had served under Lucretius Spurius. Lucretius alsowas continued in command that he might complete the building of thetown of Genoa, which had been destroyed by Mago the Carthaginian.Publius Scipio was continued in command for a period not limited inpoint of time, but the object he had to achieve, namely, till the warin Africa had been brought to a termination; and a decree was passed,ordering a supplication to be made that the circumstance of hiscrossing over into Africa might be beneficial to the Roman people, thegeneral himself, and his army."Book 30,Chapter 2,"Three thousand men were enlisted for Sicily, and lest any fleetshould go thither from Africa, as all the efficient troops thatprovince had possessed had been transported into Africa, it wasresolved that the sea-coast of that island should be guarded withforty ships. Villius took with him into Sicily thirteen ships, therest consisted of the old ones, which were repaired. Marcus Pomponius,the praetor of the former year, who was continued in command, havingbeen placed at the head of this fleet, put on board the fresh soldiersbrought from Italy. The senate assigned by a decree an equal number ofships to Cneius Octavius, who was also a praetor of the former year,with a similar privilege of command, for the protection of the coastof Sardinia. Lentulus the praetor was ordered to furnish two thousandsoldiers to put on board it. The protection of the coast of Italy wasassigned to Marcus Marcius, a praetor of the former year, withthe same number of ships; for it was uncertain to what quarter theCarthaginians would send a fleet, though it was supposed that theywould attack any quarter which was destitute of defence. The consuls,in conformity with a decree of the senate, enlisted three thousandsoldiers for this fleet, and two city legions with a view to thehazards of war. The Spains were assigned to the former generals,Lucius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus, who were continued incommand, and retained their former armies. The operations of thewar on the part of the Romans this year were carried on with twentylegions in all, and one hundred and sixty ships of war. The praetorswere ordered to proceed to their provinces. Directions were given tothe consuls, that before they left the city they should celebrate thegreat games which Titus Manlius Torquatus, when dictator, had vowedto exhibited in the fifth year, if the condition of the state remainedunaltered. Accounts of prodigies brought from several places excitedfresh superstitious fears in the minds of men. It was believed thatcrows had not only torn with their beaks some gold in the Capitol, buthad even eaten it. At Antium mice gnawed a golden crown. An immensequantity of locusts filled the whole country around Capua, nor couldit be made appear satisfactorily whence they came. At Reate a foal wasproduced with five feet. At Anagnia at first scattered fires appearedin the sky, afterwards a vast meteor blazed forth. At Frusino a circlesurrounded the sun with a thin line, which was itself afterwardsincluded within the sun's disc which extended beyond it. At Arpinumthe earth sank into an immense gulf, in a place where the ground waslevel. When one of the consuls was immolating the first victim, thehead of the liver was wanting. These prodigies were expiated withvictims of the larger kind. The college of pontiffs gave out to whatgods sacrifice was to be made."Book 30,Chapter 3,"After these matters were finished, the consuls and praetors setout for their provinces. All, however, made Africa the great object oftheir concern, as though it had been allotted to them; whether it wasbecause they saw that the welfare of the state and the issue ofthe war turned upon the operations there, or that they might obligeScipio, on whom the whole state was then intent. Accordingly, not onlyfrom Sardinia, as has been before mentioned, but from Sicily also andSpain, clothing and corn, and from Sicily arms also, together withevery kind of stores, were conveyed thither. Nor did Scipio at anytime during the winter relax in any of the various military operationsin which he was engaged on all sides. He continued the siege of Utica.His camp was within sight of Hasdrubal. The Carthaginians had launchedtheir ships, and had a fleet prepared and equipped to intercept hissupplies. Amid these occupations he had not even lost sight of hisendeavours to regain the friendship of Syphax, whose passion for hisbride he thought might now perhaps have become satiated fromunlimited enjoyment. From Syphax he received terms of peace with theCarthaginians, with proposals that the Romans should evacuate Africa,and the Carthaginians Italy, rather than any ground of hope that hewould desert their cause if the war proceeded. For my part I am ofopinion, and in this I am countenanced by the majority of writers,that these negotiations were carried on through messengers, ratherthan that Syphax himself came to the Roman camp to hold a conference,as Antias Valerius relates. At first the Roman general scarcelyallowed these terms to be mentioned, but afterwards, in order thatthere might exist a plausible pretext for his emissaries to gofrequently into the camp of the enemy, he rejected these same terms ina more qualified manner, holding out a hope that they might eventuallycome to an agreement by agitating the question on both sides.The winter huts of the Carthaginians, which were constructed frommaterials hastily collected out of the fields, were almost entirelyof wood. The Numidians, particularly, lay for the most part in hutsformed of interwoven reeds, and covered with mats, dispersed up anddown without any regard to order; while some of them, having chosenthe situations for their tents without waiting for orders, lay evenwithout the trench and rampart. These circumstances having beenreported to Scipio, gave him hopes that he might have an opportunityof burning the enemy's camp."Book 30,Chapter 4,"In company with the ambassadors whom he sent to Syphax, he alsosent some centurions of the first rank, of tried valour and prudence,dressed as servants, in lieu of soldiers' drudges; in order that,while the ambassadors were engaged in conference, they might ramblethrough the camp, one in one direction and another in another, andthus observe all the approaches and outlets, the situation and formboth of the camp in general and of its parts; where the Carthaginianslay, where the Numidians, and what was the distance between the campof Hasdrubal and that of the king; and that they might at the sametime acquaint themselves with their customary mode of stationingoutposts and watches, and learn whether they were more open tostratagem by night or by day. During the frequent conferences whichwere held, several different persons were purposely sent, in orderthat every circumstance might be known to a greater number. When themore frequent agitation of the matter had given to Syphax a dailyincreasing hope of peace, and to the Carthaginians through him, theRoman ambassadors at length declared that they were forbidden toreturn to their general unless a decisive answer was given, and that,therefore, if his own determination was now fixed, he should declareit, or if Hasdrubal and the Carthaginians were to be consulted, heshould consult them. That it was time either that an accommodationshould be settled or the war vigorously prosecuted. While Hasdrubalwas consulted by Syphax, and the Carthaginians by Hasdrubal, the spieshad time to inspect every thing, and Scipio to get together what wasnecessary for the accomplishment of his project. In consequence of themention and prospect of a peace, neglect arose among the Carthaginiansand Numidians, as is usually the case, to take precautions in the meantime that they might not suffer an attack of the enemy. At length ananswer was returned; and as the Romans appeared excessively eagerfor peace, advantage was taken of that circumstance to add certainunreasonable conditions, which afforded Scipio a very seasonablepretext for putting an end to the truce according to his wishes; andtelling the king's messenger that he would refer the matter to hiscouncil, he answered him the next day. He said, that while he alonehad in vain endeavoured to restore peace, no one else had desired it.That he must, therefore, carry word back that Syphax must hope forpeace on no other condition than his abandonment of the Carthaginians.Thus he put an end to the truce, in order that he might be free toexecute his designs without breaking his faith; and, launchinghis ships, for it was now the beginning of spring, he put on boardmachines and engines, with the purpose of assaulting Utica fromthe sea. He also sent two thousand men to seize the eminence whichcommanded that place, and which he had before occupied, at once withthe view of turning the attention of the enemy from the design he wasendeavouring to effect to another object of concern, and to preventany sally or attack which might be made from the city upon his camp,which would be left with a slight force to protect it, while hehimself went against Syphax and Hasdrubal."Book 30,Chapter 5,"Having made these preparations, he called a council and afterordering the spies to give an account of the discoveries theyhad made, and requesting Masinissa, who was acquainted with everycircumstance relating to the enemy, to state what he knew, lastly, hehimself laid before the council the plan proposed for the followingnight. He gave directions to the tribunes, that when, after thebreaking up of the council, the trumpets had sounded, they shouldimmediately march the legions out of the camp. Agreeably to hiscommands, the standards began to be carried out about sun-set. Aboutthe first watch they formed the troops in marching order. At midnight,for it was seven miles' march, they came up at a moderate pace to thecamp of the enemy. Here Scipio assigned a part of his forces, togetherwith Masinissa and the Numidians, to Laelius, ordering them to fallupon the camp of Syphax, and throw fire upon it. Then taking eachof the commanders, Masinissa and Laelius, aside, he implored themseparately to make up by diligence and care for the absence of thatforesight which the night rendered it impossible to exercise. He said,that he should himself attack Hasdrubal and the Carthaginian camp; butthat he should not begin till he saw the fire in that of the king.Nor did this delay him long; for when the fire thrown upon the nearesthuts had taken effect, immediately communicating with all those whichwere within the shortest distance, and those connected with them inregular succession, it spread itself throughout the whole camp. Theconfusion and alarm which took place, in consequence of so widelyextended a fire breaking out during the night, were as great as mightnaturally be expected; but as they concluded that it was the effect ofchance, and not produced by the enemy, or connected with the war, theyrushed out in a disorderly manner, without their arms, to extinguishthe flames, and fell in with armed enemies, particularly theNumidians, who on account of their knowledge of the king's campwere placed by Masinissa in convenient places at the openings of thepasses. Many perished in the flames in their beds while half asleep;and many, tumbling over one another in their haste to escape, weretrampled to death in the narrow passages of the gates."Book 30,Chapter 6,"When first the Carthaginian sentinels, and afterwards the rest,roused by the terrifying effects of a tumult by night, beheld thelight emitted from the flames, they also, labouring under the samedelusion, imagined that the fire had originated from accidentalcauses; while the shout raised amidst the slaughter and wounds, beingof a confused kind, prevented their distinguishing whether it wasoccasioned by the trepidation of an alarm by night. Accordingly,rushing out one and all at every gate, each man taking the nearestroad, without their arms, as not suspecting any hostile attack,and carrying with them only such things as might be useful inextinguishing the flames, they fell upon the Roman troops. After allthese had been slain, not only with the animosity of enemies, but alsothat no one might escape as a messenger, Scipio immediately attackedthe gates, which were unguarded in consequence of the confusion; and,having thrown fire upon the nearest huts, at first the flames blazedforth with great fury, in several places at once, in consequenceof the fire having been applied to different parts, but afterwardsextending themselves along the contiguous huts, they suddenlyenveloped the whole camp in one general conflagration. Men and cattlescorched with the flames blocked up the passages of the gates, firstin a terrible rush to escape, and afterwards with their prostratebodies. Those who got out of the way of the fire were cut off by thesword, and the two camps were involved in one common destruction. Thetwo generals, however, and out of so many thousand troops only twothousand foot and five hundred horsemen, escaped, half armed, a greatmany of them being wounded and scorched. Forty thousand men wereeither slain or destroyed by the flames, and above five thousandcaptured. Among the captured were many Carthaginian nobles, elevensenators, with a hundred and seventy-four military standards, abovetwo thousand seven hundred Numidian horses, and six elephants. Eightelephants were destroyed either by fire or sword, and a great quantityof arms taken. All the latter the general dedicated to Vulcan andburnt."Book 30,Chapter 7,"Hasdrubal, in his flight, had made for the nearest city of theAfricans, accompanied by a few attendants; and hither all thosewho survived, following the footsteps of their general had betakenthemselves. But afterwards, fearing lest he should be given up toScipio, he quitted that city. Soon after the Romans were receivedthere with open gates; nor was any act of hostility committed, becausethe inhabitants had surrendered voluntarily. Shortly after, two othercities were captured and plundered. The booty found there, togetherwith what had been rescued from the camps when burning, and from theflames, was given up to the soldiers. Syphax took up a position in afortified place about eight miles off. Hasdrubal hastened to Carthage,lest the apprehensions occasioned by the recent disaster should leadto any timorous measures. So great was the consternation created thereon the first receipt of the news, that it was fully anticipated thatScipio, suspending his operations against Utica, would immediatelylay siege to Carthage. The suffetes, therefore, who form with them anauthority similar to the consular, summoned the senate, when thethree following opinions were given. The first proposed, that a decreeshould be passed to the effect, that ambassadors should be sent toScipio to treat of peace; the second, that Hannibal should be recalledto defend his country from a war which threatened its annihilation;the third breathed the spirit of Roman constancy under adversity; itrecommended that the losses of the army should be repaired, and thatSyphax should be exhorted not to abandon the war. The latter opinionprevailed, because it was that which Hasdrubal, who was present, andall the members of the Barcine faction, preferred. After this,the levy commenced in the city and country, and ambassadors weredespatched to Syphax, who was himself employing every effort torestore the war; for his wife had prevailed upon him, not, asheretofore, by caresses, powerful as they are in influencing the mindof a lover, but by prayers and appeals to his compassion, imploringhim, with streaming eyes, not to betray her father and her country,nor suffer Carthage to be consumed by the same flames which hadreduced the camps to ashes. In addition to this, the ambassadorsinformed him of a circumstance which had occurred very seasonably toraise their hopes; that they had met with four thousand Celtiberiansin the neighbourhood of a city named Abba, a fine body of young menwho had been enlisted by their recruiting officers in Spain; and thatHasdrubal would very soon arrive with a body of troops by no meanscontemptible. Accordingly, he not only returned a kind answer to theambassadors, but also showed them a multitude of Numidian rustics,whom he had lately furnished with arms and horses; and at the sametime assured them that he would call out all the youth in his kingdom.He said, he well knew that the loss sustained had been occasioned byfire, and not by battle, and that he was inferior to his adversary inwar who was overcome by force of arms. Such was the answer given tothe ambassadors; and, after a few days, Hasdrubal and Syphax againunited their forces. This army consisted of about thirty-five thousandfighting men."Book 30,Chapter 8,"Scipio, considering that Syphax and the Carthaginians could make nofurther efforts, gave his whole attention to the siege of Utica, andwas now bringing up his engines to the walls, when he was divertedfrom his purpose by a report of the renewal of the war; and, leavingsmall forces merely to keep up the appearance of a siege by sea andland, he set out himself with the main strength of his army to meetthe enemy. At first he took up his position on an eminence about fivemiles distant from the king's camp. The next day, coming down with hiscavalry into a place called the great plains, which lay at the foot ofthat eminence, he spent the day in advancing up to the outposts of theenemy, and provoking them by skirmishing attacks. During the ensuingtwo days, irregular excursions were made by both sides alternately,but nothing worthy of notice was achieved. On the fourth day, bothsides came down in battle-array. The Romans placed their principesbehind the spearmen, which latter formed the front line, and thetriarii they stationed in reserve; the Italian cavalry they opposed tothe enemy in the right wing, the Numidians and Masinissa on theleft. Syphax and Hasdrubal, placing the Numidians against the Italiancavalry, and the Carthaginians opposite to Masinissa, received theCeltiberians into the centre of their line, to face the Roman legions.Thus arranged, they then commenced the encounter. At the first charge,both the wings, the Numidians and Carthaginians, were together drivenfrom their ground; for neither could the Numidians, who consistedprincipally of rustics, sustain the shock of the Roman cavalry, northe Carthaginians, who were also raw soldiers, withstand Masinissa,who, in addition to other circumstances, was rendered formidable byhis recent victory. The Celtiberian line, though stript of the supportof both the wings, stood their ground; for neither did any hope ofsafety by flight present itself, as they were ignorant of the country,nor could they expect pardon from Scipio, against whom, though he haddeserved well both of them and their nation, they had come into Africato fight for hire. Surrounded therefore, on all sides by the enemy,they died with obstinate resolution, falling one upon another; and,while the attention of all was turned upon them, Syphax and Hasdrubalgained a considerable space of time to effect their escape. Thevictors, fatigued with the slaughter, which had continued for agreater length of time than the battle, were interrupted by the night."Book 30,Chapter 9,"The next day Scipio sent Laelius and Masinissa, with all the Romanand Numidian cavalry, and the light infantry, to pursue Syphax andHasdrubal. He himself, with the main strength of the army, reduced theneighbouring towns, which were all subject to the Carthaginians, someby holding out hopes to them, some by threats, and others by force.At Carthage, indeed, the consternation was extreme; and it was fullyanticipated there, that Scipio, who was carrying his arms to thedifferent places around, would, after having rapidly subdued all theneighbouring parts, suddenly attack Carthage itself. Their wallswere repaired and protected with outworks; and every man individuallyexerted himself to the utmost in collecting from the country therequisites for holding out against a protracted siege. Mention wasseldom made of peace, but not so seldom of sending deputies to recallHannibal. The majority of them urged that the fleet, which had beenequipped to intercept the convoys of the enemy, should be sent tosurprise the ships stationed near Utica, which were lying in anunguarded state. It was also urged that they might perhaps overpowerthe naval camp, which was left under the protection of a triflingforce. They chiefly inclined to the latter plan, though they thought,nevertheless, that deputies should be sent to Hannibal; for should theoperations of the fleet succeed in the highest degree, the siege ofUtica would be partially raised, but they had no general remaining butHannibal, and no army but his which could defend Carthage itself.The ships were therefore launched the following day, and, at the sametime, the deputies set out for Italy; and, their position stimulatingthem, every thing was done with the greatest expedition; each manconsidering, that the safety of all was betrayed in whatever degree heremitted his own individual exertions. Scipio, who drew after himan army now encumbered with the spoils of many cities, sent hisprisoners, and other booty, to his old camp at Utica, and, as hisviews were now fixed on Carthage, he seized on Tunes, which wasabandoned in consequence of the flight of the garrison. This city isabout fifteen miles distant from Carthage, being a place secured bothby works, and also by its own natural position; it may be seen fromCarthage, and itself affords a prospect both of that city and of thesea which washes it."Book 30,Chapter 10,"From this place the Romans, while diligently employed in raisinga rampart, descried the fleet of the enemy, on its way to Utica fromCarthage. Desisting from their work, therefore, orders for marchingwere given, and the troops began to move with the utmost haste, lestthe ships which were turned towards the land, and occupied withthe siege, and which were far from being in a condition for a navalbattle, should be surprised and overpowered. For how could ships,carrying engines and machines, and either converted to the purposesof transports, or brought up to the walls so as to afford the meansof mounting up, in lieu of a mound and bridges, resist a fleet, withnothing to impede its movements, furnished with every kind of navalimplement, and prepared for action. Scipio, therefore, contrary tohis usual practice in naval engagements, drew the ships of war, whichmight have been employed in defending the rest, into the rear, andformed them into a line near the land; opposing to the enemy a rowof transports, four deep, to serve as a wall; and, lest these sametransports should be thrown into disorder during the confusion of thebattle, he bound them together by placing masts and yard-arms acrossthem, from one vessel to the other; and, by means of strong ropes,fastened them together, as it were, by one uninterrupted bond. He alsolaid planks upon them, so as to form a free passage along the line,leaving spaces under these bridges of communication by which thevessels of observation might run out towards the enemy, and retreatwith safety. Having hastily made these arrangements as well as thetime would permit, he put on board the transports about a thousandpicked men, to keep off the enemy, with a very large store of weapons,particularly missiles, that they might hold out, however long thecontest lasted. Thus prepared, and on the watch, they waited theapproach of the enemy. The Carthaginians, who, if they had made hastewould, on the first assault, have surprised their adversaries whileevery thing was in a state of confusion, from the hurry and bustleattending the preparations, were so dismayed at their losses by land,and thereby had lost so much confidence even in their strength by sea,in which they had the advantage, that, after consuming the day, inconsequence of the slow rate at which they sailed, about sun-set theyput in to a harbour which the Africans call Ruscino. The followingday, at sun-rise, they drew up their ships towards the open sea, asfor a regular naval battle, and with the expectation that the Romanswould come out to engage them. After they had continued stationary forsome time, and saw that no movement was made on the part of the enemy,then, at length, they attacked the transports. The affair bore noresemblance to a naval fight, but rather had the appearance of shipsattacking walls. The transports had considerably the advantage inrespect of height; and as the Carthaginians had to throw their weaponsupward, against a mark which was above them, most of them failed oftaking effect; while the weapons thrown from the transports from abovefell with increased force, and derived additional impetus from theirvery weight. The vessels of observation, and even the lighter kindof barks, which went out through the spaces left under the flooring,which formed a communication between the ships, were at first run downby the mere momentum and bulk of the ships of war; and afterwards theyproved a hindrance to the troops appointed to keep the enemy off; foras they mixed with the ships of the enemy, they were frequently underthe necessity of withholding their weapons for fear, by a misdirectedeffort, they should fall on their friends. At length, beams with ironhooks at their ends, called harpoons, began to be thrown from theCarthaginian upon the Roman ships; and, as they could not cut theharpoons themselves, nor the chains suspended by which they werethrown upon their ships, as each of the ships of war of the enemy,being pulled back, drew with it a transport, connected with it by aharpoon, you might see the fastenings by which the transports werejoined together rent asunder, and in another part a series of manyvessels dragged away together. In this manner chiefly were all thebridges of communication torn to pieces, and scarcely had the troopswho fought in front time to leap to the second line of ships. Aboutsix transports were towed away to Carthage, where the joy felt wasgreater than the occasion warranted; but their delight was increasedfrom the reflection, that, in the midst of so many successivedisasters and woes, one event, however trifling, which afforded matterof joy, had unexpectedly occurred; besides which, it was manifest thatthe Roman fleet would have been well nigh annihilated, had not theirown commanders been wanting in diligence, and had not Scipio come upto its assistance in time."Book 30,Chapter 11,"It happened about the same time, that Laelius and Masinissahaving arrived in Numidia after a march of about fifteen days, theMassylians, Masinissa's hereditary kingdom, placed themselves underthe protection of their king with the greatest joy, as they had longwished him among them. After the commanders and garrisons of Syphaxhad been expelled from thence, that prince kept himself withinthe limits of his original dominions, but without any intention ofremaining quiet. Subdued by the power of love, he was spurred on byhis wife and father-in-law; and he possessed such an abundance of menand horses, that a review of the resources of his kingdom, which hadflourished for so many years, was calculated to infuse spirit into amind even less barbarous and impetuous than his. Wherefore, collectingtogether all who were fit for service, he distributed among themhorses, armour, and weapons. He divided his horsemen into troops, andhis infantry into cohorts, as he had formerly learnt from the Romancenturions. With an army not less than that which he had before, butalmost entirely raw and undisciplined, he set out to meet the enemy,and pitched his camp at a short distance from them. At first a fewhorsemen advanced cautiously from the outposts to reconnoitre, andbeing compelled to retire, from a discharge of javelins, they ran backto their friends. Then skirmishing parties were sent out from bothsides, and the vanquished, fired with indignation, returned to theencounter with increased numbers. This is the usual incitement ofbattles between cavalry, when the victors are joined by more of theirparty from hope, and the vanquished from resentment. Thus, on thepresent occasion, the action commencing with a few, at last the wholebody of the cavalry on both sides poured out to join in it from thezeal excited by the contest. While the cavalry only were engaged, itwas scarcely possible to withstand the numbers of the Masaesylians,which Syphax sent out in immense bodies. But afterwards, when theRoman infantry, suddenly coming up between the troops of horse whichmade way for them, gave stability to their line, and checked theenemy, who were charging furiously, at first the barbarians slackenedtheir speed, then halted, and were in a manner confounded at thisnovel kind of battle. At length, they not only retired before theinfantry, but were unable to sustain the shock even of the cavalry,who had assumed courage from the support of the infantry. By this timethe legions also were approaching; when, indeed, the Masaesylians notonly dared not await their first charge, but could not bear eventhe sight of the standards and arms; so powerful was either therecollection of their former defeats, or their present fears."Book 30,Chapter 12,"It was then that Syphax, while riding up to the troops of theenemy to try if, either by shame or by exposing his own person todanger, he could stop their flight, being thrown from his horse, whichwas severely wounded, was overpowered, and being made prisoner, wasdragged alive into the presence of Laelius; a spectacle calculated toafford peculiar satisfaction to Masinissa. Cirta was the capital ofthe dominions of Syphax; to which a great number of men fled. Thenumber of the slain in this battle was not so great as the victory wasimportant, because the cavalry only had been engaged. Not more thanfive thousand were slain, and less than half that number were madeprisoners in an attack upon the camp, to which the multitude, dismayedat the loss of their king, had fled. Masinissa declared that nothingcould be more highly gratifying to him than, having gained thisvictory, to go now and visit his hereditary dominions, which he hadregained after having been kept out of them so long a time; but it wasnot proper in prosperity any more than in adversity to lose any time.That if Laelius would allow him to go before him to Cirta with thecavalry and the captive Syphax, he should overpower the enemy whileall was in a state of consternation and dismay; and that Laelius mightfollow with the infantry at a moderate rate. Laelius assenting, headvanced to Cirta, and ordered the principal inhabitants to be calledout to a conference. But as they were not aware of what had befallentheir king, he was unable to prevail upon them, either by layingbefore them what had passed, by threats, or by persuasion, until theking was presented to their view in chains. A general lamentationarose at this shocking exhibition, and while some deserted the wallsin a panic, others, who sought to ingratiate themselves with thevictor, suddenly came to an agreement to throw open the gates.Masinissa, having sent troops to keep guard near the gates, andat such parts of the wall as required it, that no one might have apassage out to escape by, galloped off to seize the palace. Whileentering the porch, Sophonisba, the wife of Syphax and daughter ofHasdrubal the Carthaginian, met him in the very threshold, and seeingMasinissa in the midst of the armed band, for he was distinguishedboth by his arms and also by his habiliments, she concluded, as wasreally the case, that he was the king; and, falling down at his knees,thus addressed him: ""The gods, together with your own valour and goodfortune, have given you the power of disposing of us as you please.But if a captive may be allowed to give utterance to the voice ofsupplication before him who is the sovereign arbiter of her life ordeath; if she may be permitted to touch his knees and his victoriousright hand, I entreat and beseech, you by the majesty of royalty,which we also a short time ago possessed; by the name of the Numidianrace, which was common to Syphax and yourself; by the guardian deitiesof this palace, (and O! may they receive you more auspiciously thanthey sent Syphax from it!) that you would indulge a suppliant bydetermining yourself whatever your inclination may suggest respectingyour captive, and not suffer me to be placed at the haughty andmerciless disposal of any Roman. Were I nothing more than the wife ofSyphax, yet would I rather make trial of the honour of a Numidian,one born in Africa, the same country which gave me birth than ofa foreigner and an alien. You know what a Carthaginian, what thedaughter of Hasdrubal, has to fear from a Roman. If you cannot effectit by any other means, I beg and beseech you that you will by my deathrescue me from the power of the Romans."" She was remarkably beautiful,and in the full bloom of youth. Accordingly, while she pressed hisright hand, and only implored him to pledge himself that she shouldnot be delivered up to any Roman, her language assuming the characterof amorous blandishment rather than entreaty, the heart of theconqueror not only melted with compassion, but, as the Numidians arean excessively amorous race, he became the slave of his captive; andgiving his right hand as a pledge for the performance of her request,withdrew into the palace. He then set upon reflecting in what mannerhe could make good his promise; and not being able to hit upon anyexpedient, his passion suggested to him an inconsiderate and barefacedalternative. He ordered that preparations should be instantly madefor celebrating the nuptials that very day; in order that he mightnot leave it at all open to Laelius, or Scipio himself, to adoptany measure respecting her as a captive who had become the wife ofMasinissa. After the nuptials were concluded, Laelius came up: and sofar was he from dissembling his disapprobation of the proceeding, thatat first he would even have had her dragged from the marriage bedand sent with Syphax and the rest of the captives to Scipio: butafterwards, having been prevailed upon by the entreaties of Masinissa,who begged of him to leave it to Scipio to decide which of the twokings should have his fortunes graced by the accession of Sophonisbahe sent away Syphax and the prisoners; and, aided by Masinissa,employed himself in reducing the rest of the cities of Numidia, whichwere occupied by the king's garrisons."Book 30,Chapter 13,"When it was announced that Syphax was being brought into the camp,the whole multitude poured out, as if to behold a triumphal pageant.The king himself walked first in chains, and a number of Numidiannobles followed. On this occasion every one strove to the utmost toincrease the splendour of their victory, by magnifying the greatnessof Syphax and the renown of his nation. ""That was the king,"" theysaid, ""to whose dignity the two most powerful nations in the world theRoman and the Carthaginian, had paid so much deference, that their owngeneral, Scipio, leaving his province of Spain and his army, sailedinto Africa with only two quinqueremes to solicit his friendship;while Hasdrubal, the Carthaginian general, not only visited him in hisdominions, but gave him his daughter in marriage. That he had in hispower two commanders, one a Roman and the other a Carthaginian, at thesame time. That as both the contending parties sought the favourof the immortal gods by the immolation of victims, so had they bothequally solicited his friendship. That he had lately possessed suchgreat power, that after expelling Masinissa from his kingdom, hereduced him to such a state, that his life was protected by a reportof his death, and by concealment, while he supported himself in thewoods on prey after the manner of wild beasts."" Thus signalized by theobservations of the surrounding multitude, the king was brought intothe pavilion before Scipio, who was moved by the former conditionof the man compared with his present, and particularly by therecollection of their relation of hospitality, his right hand pledged,and the public and private connexion which had been formed betweenthem. These same considerations inspired Syphax also with confidencein addressing the conqueror; for when Scipio asked what had been hisobject in not only renouncing his alliance with the Romans, but inmaking war against them without provocation, he fully admitted ""thathe had indeed done wrong, and acted like a madman; but not at thattime only when he took up arms against the Roman people; that was theconsummation of his frenzy, not its commencement. Then it was thathe is mad; then it was that he banished from his mind all regardfor private friendship and public treaties, when he received aCarthaginian wife into his house. It was by the flames kindled bythose nuptial torches that his palace had been consumed. That furyand pest had by every kind of fascination engrossed his affectionsand obscured his reason; nor had she rested till she had with her ownhands clad him with impious arms against his guest and friend. Yetruined and fallen as he was, he derived some consolation in hismisfortunes when he saw that that same pest and fury had beentransferred to the dwelling and household gods of the man who was ofall others his greatest enemy. That Masinissa was neither more prudentnor more firm than Syphax; but even more incautious by reason of hisyouth. Doubtless he had shown greater folly and want of self-controlin marrying her than he himself had."""Book 30,Chapter 14,"These words, dictated not merely by the hatred naturally felttowards an enemy, but also by the anguish of jealousy, on seeing theobject of his affections in the possession of his rival, affected themind of Scipio with no ordinary degree of anxiety. His accusationsagainst Masinissa derived credibility from the fact of the nuptialshaving, been celebrated in the most violent hurry, almost amid theclash of arms, without consulting or waiting for Laelius, and withsuch precipitate haste, that on the very day on which he saw thecaptive enemy he united himself with her in matrimony, and performedthe nuptial rite in the presence of the household gods of his enemy.This conduct appeared the more heinous to Scipio, because when a veryyoung man in Spain he had not allowed himself to be influenced bythe beauty of any captive. While ruminating on these circumstances,Laelius and Masinissa came up. Without making any distinction betweenthem he received them both with a cheerful countenance, and havingbestowed upon them the highest commendations before a full assemblyof his officers, he took Masinissa aside and thus addressed him:""I suppose, Masinissa, that it was because you saw in me some goodqualities that you at first came to me when in Spain, for the purposeof forming a friendship with me, and that afterwards in Africa youcommitted yourself and all your hopes to my protection. But of allthose virtues, on account of which I seemed to you worthy of yourregard, there is not one in which I gloried so much as temperance andthe control of my passions. I could wish that you also, Masinissa,had added this to your other distinguished qualities. There is not,believe me, there is not so much danger to be apprehended by personsat our time of life from armed foes, as from the pleasures whichsurround us on all sides. The man who by temperance has curbed andsubdued his appetite for them, has acquired for himself much greaterhonour and a much more important victory than we now enjoy in theconquest of Syphax. I have mentioned with delight, and I remember withpleasure, the instances of fortitude and courage which you displayedin my absence. As to other matters, I would rather that you shouldreflect upon them in private, than that you should be put to theblush by my reciting them. Syphax was subdued and captured underthe auspices of the Roman people; therefore he himself, his wife hiskingdom, his territories, his towns and their inhabitants, in short,every thing which belonged to him, is the booty of the Roman people,and it was proper that the king himself and his consort, even thoughshe had not been a citizen of Carthage, even though we did not see herfather commanding the armies of our enemies, should be sent to Rome,and that the senate and people of Rome should judge and determinerespecting her who is said to have alienated from us a king inalliance with us, and to have precipitated him into war with us.Subdue your passions. Beware how you deform many good qualities by onevice, and mar the credit of so many meritorious deeds by a degree ofguilt more than proportioned to the value of its object."""Book 30,Chapter 15,"While Masinissa heard these observations, he not only becamesuffused with blushes, but burst into tears; and after declaring thathe would submit to the discretion of the general, and imploring himthat, as far as circumstances would permit, he would consider theobligation he had rashly imposed upon himself, for he had promisedthat he would not deliver her into the power of any one, he retired inconfusion from the pavilion into his own tent. There, dismissinghis attendants, he spent a considerable time amid frequent sighs andgroans, which could be distinctly heard by those who stood around thetent. At last, heaving a deep groan, he called one of his servants inwhom he confided, in whose custody poison was kept, according to thecustom of kings, as a remedy against the unforeseen events of fortune,and ordered him to mix some in a cup and carry it to Sophonisba; atthe same time informing her that Masinissa would gladly have fulfilledthe first obligation which as a husband he owed to her his wife; butsince those who had the power of doing so had deprived him of theexercise of that right, he now performed his second promise, that sheshould not come alive into the power of the Romans. That, mindful ofher father the general, of her country, and of the two kings to whomshe had been married, she would take such measures as she herselfthought proper. When the servant came to Sophonisba bearing thismessage and the poison, she said, ""I accept this nuptial present; noris it an unwelcome one, if my husband can render me no better service.Tell him, however, that I should have died with greater satisfactionhad I not married so near upon my death."" The spirit with which shespoke was equalled by the firmness with which she took and drained thechalice, without exhibiting any symptom of perturbation. When Scipiowas informed of this event, fearful lest the high-spirited youngman should in the distempered state of his mind adopt some desperateresolution, he immediately sent for him, and at one time endeavouredto solace him, at another gently rebuked him for expiating one act oftemerity with another, and rendering the affair more tragical than wasnecessary. The next day, in order to divert his mind from his presentaffliction, he ascended his tribunal and ordered an assembly to besummoned, in which having first saluted Masinissa with the title ofking, and distinguished him with the highest encomiums, he presentedhim with a golden goblet, a curule chair, an ivory sceptre, anembroidered gown, and a triumphal vest. He increased the honour byobserving, that among the Romans there was nothing more magnificentthan a triumph; and that those who triumphed were not arrayed withmore splendid ornaments than those with which the Roman peopleconsidered Masinissa alone, of all foreigners, worthy. He thenbestowed the highest commendations upon Laelius also, and presentedhim with a golden crown, and gave presents to the other militarycharacters proportioned to their respective merits. By these honoursthe king's mind was soothed, and encouraged to hope that he wouldspeedily become master of all Numidia, now that Syphax was removed."Book 30,Chapter 16,"Scipio, having sent Caius Laelius with Syphax and the rest of theprisoners to Rome, with whom went also ambassadors from Masinissa, ledhis troops back again to Tunes, and completed the fortifications whichhe had before begun. The Carthaginians, who had experienced not onlya short-lived but almost groundless joy, from their attack upon thefleet, which, under existing circumstances, was tolerably successful,were so dismayed at the account of the capture of Syphax, in whom theyreposed almost greater confidence than in Hasdrubal and his army, thatnow listening no longer to any who advocated war, they sent thirtyof their principal elders as deputies to solicit peace. With them thecouncil of elders is held in the highest reverence, and has supremepower even to control the senate itself. When they came into the Romancamp and entered the pavilion, they prostrated themselves after themanner of those who pay profound adoration to kings, adopting thecustom, I suppose, from the country from which they derived theirorigin. Their language corresponded with such abject humiliation, forthey did not endeavour to deny their guilt, but charged Hannibal andthe favourers of his violent measures with being the originators ofit. They implored pardon for their state, which had been now twicebrought to the brink of ruin by the temerity of its citizens, andwould again owe its safety to the indulgence of its enemies. Theysaid, the object the Roman people aimed at in the subjugation of theirenemies was dominion, and not their destruction; that he might enjoinwhat he pleased upon them, as being prepared submissively to obey.Scipio replied, ""that he had come into Africa with the hope, andthat hope had been increased by the success he had experienced in hisoperations, that he should carry home victory and not terms of peace.Still, though he had victory in a manner within his grasp, he wouldnot refuse all accommodation, that all the nations of the world mayknow that the Roman people both undertake and conclude wars withjustice."" The terms of peace which he prescribed were these: ""Thatthey should restore the prisoners, deserters, and fugitives; withdrawtheir armies from Italy and Gaul; give up all claim to Spain; retirefrom all the islands between Italy and Africa; deliver up all theirships of war except twenty, and furnish five hundred thousand pecks ofwheat, and three hundred thousand of barley."" Authors are not agreedas to the sum of money he demanded. In some I find five thousandtalents; in others five thousand pounds' weight of silver; in others,that double pay for the troops was required. ""Three days,"" he said,""shall be allowed to deliberate whether you accept of peace on theseterms. If you do accept it, make a truce within me, and send deputiesto Rome to the senate."" The Carthaginians being thus dismissed, asthey thought it proper to accept of any conditions of peace, for theironly object was to gain time for Hannibal to cross over into Africa,sent some ambassadors to Scipio to conclude a truce, and others toRome to solicit peace; the latter taking with them a few prisoners,deserters, and fugitives, in order to facilitate the attainment ofpeace."Book 30,Chapter 17,"Laelius with Syphax and the principal Numidian prisoners arrivedat Rome several days before, and laying before the senate all thetransactions which had occurred in Africa in order, the greatest joywas felt for the present, and the most sanguine anticipations formedof the future. The sense of the senate being then taken upon thesubject, they resolved that the king should be sent to Alba to be keptin custody, and that Laelius should be detained until the arrivalof the Carthaginian ambassadors. A supplication for four days wasdecreed. The senate breaking up and an assembly of the people beingthen called, Publius Aelius the praetor accompanied by Caius Laelius,mounted the rostrum. There, on hearing that the armies of theCarthaginians had been routed, that a king of the greatest renown hadbeen vanquished and made prisoner, that all Numidia had been overrunwith brilliant success, the people were unable to refrain fromexpressing their delight, but manifested their transports by shoutsand all the other means usually resorted to by the multitude. Thepraetor, therefore, immediately issued orders that the keepers shouldopen all the temples throughout the city, and that the people shouldbe allowed during the whole day to go round and make their adorationto the gods, and return their thanks. The next day he brought theambassadors of Masinissa before the senate. They in the first placecongratulated the senate on the successes of Scipio in Africa, andthen thanked them, not only for having saluted him with the title ofking, but for having made him one, by reinstating him in his paternaldominions, where, now that Syphax was removed, he would reign, if itwas the pleasure of the senate, without fear or opposition. Next, forhaving bestowed upon him the highest commendations in the assembly,and decorated him with the most magnificent presents, of whichMasinissa had endeavoured, and would in future endeavour, to renderhimself worthy. They requested that the senate would by a decreeconfirm the title of king with the other favours and benefitsconferred by Scipio, and, if it were not troublesome, they said, thatMasinissa further Requested that they would send home the Numidiancaptives who were detained at Rome; for that this boon would procurehim the esteem and honour of his countrymen. On these points thesenate replied to the ambassadors, ""that they reciprocated thecongratulations of the king on the successes in Africa. That Scipiowas considered to have acted properly and regularly in saluting himwith the title of king, and that the senate applauded and approved ofevery thing else he had done which was gratifying to Masinissa."" Theyappointed by a decree what presents the ambassadors should carry tothe king; they were, two purple cloaks, each having a golden clasp,and each accompanied with vests and broad purple borders, two horsesarrayed with trappings, two suits of equestrian armour with coats ofmail, together with tents and other military apparatus such as thoseusually provided for a consul. These the praetor was directed to sendfor the king. The ambassadors were severally presented with not lessthan five thousand _asses_, their attendants with one thousand. Twosuits of apparel were presented to each of the ambassadors, and oneto each of their attendants and to the Numidians, who were dischargedfrom custody and given back to the king. In addition to these,dwellings, reserved by the state for such purposes, grounds, andentertainment, were assigned to the ambassadors."Book 30,Chapter 18,"The same summer during which these decrees were passed at Rome,and these transactions took place in Africa, Publius QuinctiliusVarus, the praetor, and Marcus Cornelius, the proconsul, fought apitched battle with Mago the Carthaginian in the territories of theInsubrian Gauls. The legions of the praetor were in the first line;Cornelius kept his in reserve, riding forward into the front himself,and the praetor and proconsul, leading on the two wings, exhortedthe soldiers to attack the enemy with the utmost vigour. Finding theyproduced no impression upon the enemy, Quinctilius said to Cornelius:""The battle, as you perceive, does not proceed with spirit, the enemy,having succeeded in their resistance beyond expectation, have becomecallous to fear, and there is danger lest it should be converted intoboldness. We must stir up a tempest of cavalry if we wish to disorderand drive them from their ground; therefore, either do you sustain thefight in front, and I will lead the cavalry into the action; or else,I will act in the front line and you send out the cavalry of the fourlegions against the enemy."" The proconsul offering to take whicheverpart of the service the praetor pleased, Quinctilius the praetor, withhis son, surnamed Marcus, a spirited youth, went off to the cavalry,and desiring them to mount, instantly led them to the charge. Theconfusion on occasioned by these was increased by a shout raised bythe legions; nor would the line of the enemy have stood unbroken, hadnot Mago, as soon as he saw the cavalry in motion, immediately broughtinto the action his elephants, which he kept in readiness. The horseswere so terrified at the snorting, the smell, and appearance of theseanimals, that the aid of the cavalry was rendered ineffectual. As theRoman horseman had the advantage in point of efficiency in a closefight, when he could use his javelin and sword hand to hand, so theNumidians had the advantage when throwing their darts from a distanceupon enemies borne away from them by their terrified horses. At thesame time the twelfth legion, though a great number of them wereslain, maintained their ground through shame rather than a reliance ontheir strength; but they would not have continued to do so longer,had not the thirteenth legion, brought up into the front line from thereserve, taken up the doubtful conflict. Mago, also, bringing up theGauls from his reserve, opposed them to the fresh legion. The Gaulsbeing routed without any great effort, the spearmen of the eleventhlegion formed themselves into a circular body and charged theelephants, which were now disordering the line of infantry; and asscarcely one of the javelins which they threw upon them failed oftaking effect, as they were close together, they turned them allupon the line of their own party. Four of them fell overpowered withwounds. It was then that the front line of the enemy gave ground, thewhole body of the Roman infantry at the same time rushing forward toincrease the panic and confusion, on seeing the elephants turn theirbacks. As long as Mago stood in front, the troops stepped back slowly,preserving their ranks and not relaxing their ardour in fighting;but when they saw him falling, from a wound in his thigh, which wastransfixed, and carried off the field almost lifeless, in an instantthey all betook themselves to flight. As many as five thousand of theenemy were slain, and twenty-two military standards captured on thatday. Nor did the Romans obtain a bloodless victory. Two thousand threehundred of the army of the praetor, by far the greater part of whombelonged to the twelfth legion, were lost. Two military tribunes,Marcus Cosconius and Marcus Maenius, of the same legion; and of thethirteenth legion also, which joined in the action at its close,Cneius Helvius, a military tribune, fell in restoring the fight;and about twenty-two distinguished horsemen, together with severalcenturions, were trampled upon and killed by the elephants. Thecontest would have continued longer, had not the enemy conceded thevictory, in consequence of the wound of their general."Book 30,Chapter 19,"Mago, setting out during the silence of the succeeding night, andmarching as far at a time as his wounds would allow him, reachedthe sea-coast in the territory of the Ingaunian Ligurians. Hereambassadors from Carthage, who had put into the Gallic bay a few daysbefore, came to him with directions to cross over into Africa with allspeed; informing him that his brother Hannibal, for to him also theysaid ambassadors had gone with similar directions, would do the same,for the affairs of the Carthaginians were not in a condition toadmit of their occupying Gaul and Italy with armies. Mago, notonly influenced by the command of the senate and the danger whichthreatened his country, but fearful also lest the victorious enemyshould be upon him if he delayed, and lest the Ligurians themselves,seeing that the Carthaginians were leaving Italy, should pass overto those under whose power they were likely soon to be placed; at thesame time hoping that his wound would be less irritated by the motionof sailing than marching, and that he would have greater facilitiesfor the cure of it, put his troops on board and set sail. But he hadscarcely cleared Sardinia when he died of his wound. Several also ofhis ships, which had been dispersed in the main sea, were captured bythe Roman fleet which lay near Sardinia. Such were the transactions bysea and land in that part of Italy which is adjacent to the Alps.The consul, Caius Servilius, without having performed any memorableachievement in Etruria, his province, and in Gaul, for he had advancedthither also, but having rescued from slavery, which they had enduredfor now the sixteenth year, his father, Caius Servilius, and hisuncle, Caius Lutatius, who had been taken by the Boians at the villageof Tanetum, returned to Rome with his father on one side of him andhis uncle on the other, distinguished, by family, rather than bypublic, honours. It was proposed to the people, that Caius Serviliusshould be indemnified for having filled the offices of plebeiantribune and plebeian aedile contrary to what was established by thelaws, while his father, who had sat in the curule chair, was stillalive, he being ignorant of that circumstance. This propositionhaving been carried, he returned to his province. The towns Consentia,Uffugum, Vergae, Besidiae, Hetriculum, Sypheum, Argentanum, Clampetia,and many other inconsiderable states, perceiving that the Carthaginiancause was declining, went over to Cneius Servilius the consul inBruttium. The same consul fought a battle with Hannibal, in theterritory of Croto. The accounts of this battle are not clear.Valerius Antias states that five thousand men were slain. But thisis an event of such magnitude, that either it must be an impudentfiction, or negligently omitted. It is certain that nothing furtherwas done by Hannibal in Italy; for ambassadors from Carthage,recalling him into Africa, came to him, as it happened, at the sametime that they came to Mago."Book 30,Chapter 20,"It is said that when Hannibal heard the message of the ambassadorshe gnashed with his teeth, groaned, and scarcely refrained fromshedding tears. After they had delivered the commands with whichthey were charged, he said: ""Those who have for a long time beenendeavouring to drag me home, by forbidding the sending of suppliesand money to me, now recall me, not indirectly, but openly. Hannibal,therefore, hath been conquered, not by the Roman people, who have beenso often slain and routed, but by the Carthaginian senate, throughenvy and detraction; nor will Publius Scipio exult and glory in thisunseemly return so much as Hanno, who has crushed our family, sincehe could not effect it by any other means, by the ruins of Carthage.""Already had his mind entertained a presentiment of this event, and hehad accordingly prepared ships beforehand. Having, therefore, sent acrowd of useless soldiers under pretence of garrisons into the townsin the Bruttian territory, a few of which continued their adherence tohim, more through fear than attachment, he transported the strengthof his army into Africa. Many natives of Italy who, refusing to followhim into Africa had retired to the shrine of Juno Lacinia, which hadnever been violated up to that day, were barbarously massacred in thevery temple. It is related, that rarely any person leaving hiscountry to go into exile exhibited deeper sorrow than Hannibal did ondeparting from the land of his enemies; that he frequently looked backupon the shores of Italy, and, arraigning both gods and men, cursedhimself and his own head that he did not lead his troops, whilereeking with blood from the victory at Cannae, to Rome. Scipio, whosince his appointment to the office of consul had not looked at theCarthaginian enemy in Italy, had dared, he said, to go and attackCarthage, while he, after slaying a hundred thousand fighting men atTrasimenus and Cannae, had suffered his strength to wear away aroundCasilinum, Cumae, and Nola. Amid these reproaches and complaints hewas borne away from his long occupation of Italy."Book 30,Chapter 21,"At the same time intelligence was brought to Rome that both Magoand Hannibal had taken their departure. But the delight occasioned bythis twofold source of joy was diminished by the reflection that theircommanders had wanted either spirit or strength sufficient to detainthem, for they had been charged by the senate to do so; and also inconsequence of the anxiety they felt for the issue of a contest, inwhich the whole weight of the war rested on the efforts of one generaland his army. About the same time ambassadors from Saguntum arrived,bringing with them some Carthaginians who had crossed over into Spainfor the purpose of hiring auxiliaries, having seized them and themoney they had with them. They laid down in the vestibule of thesenate-house two hundred and fifty pounds' weight of gold, and eighthundred of silver. After the men had been received and thrown intoprison, and the gold and silver returned, the ambassadors werethanked, and received, besides, presents and ships to convey them backinto Spain. Some of the older senators then observed, that men wereless powerfully affected by prosperity than adversity. That theythemselves remembered what terror and consternation had beenoccasioned by the passage of Hannibal into Italy; what disasters andwhat lamentations had followed that event. When the camp of the enemywas seen from their walls, what vows were poured forth by each andall! How often, extending their hands to heaven, exclamations wereheard in their assemblies. Oh! will that day ever arrive when we shallbehold Italy cleared of her enemies and enjoying the blessings ofpeace! The gods, they said, had at length, in the sixteenth year,granted that favour and yet there was no one who proposed that thanksshould be returned to them for it. That if men received a presentblessing so ungratefully, they would not be very mindful of it when itwas past. In consequence of this a general shout was raised from everypart of the senate-house, that Publius Aelius the praetor, shouldlay the matter before the senate, and a decree was passed, that asupplication should be performed at all the shrines for the space offive days, and that a hundred and twenty victims of the larger sortshould be immolated. Laelius and the ambassadors of Masinissa havingbeen by this time dismissed, and intelligence having arrived thatambassadors of the Carthaginians, who were coming to the senate totreat about peace, had been seen at Puteoli, and would proceed thenceby land, it was resolved, that Caius Laelius should be recalled,that the negotiations respecting the peace might take place in hispresence. Quintus Fulvius Gillo, a lieutenant-general of Scipio,conducted the Carthaginians to Rome; and as they were forbidden toenter the city, they were lodged in a country-house belonging to thestate, and admitted to an audience of the senate at the temple ofBellona."Book 30,Chapter 22,"They addressed the senate in nearly the same terms as theyhad employed before Scipio; laying the whole blame of the war uponHannibal, and exculpating their state. They declared, that he had notonly crossed the Alps, but the Iberus also, without the sanctionof the senate; and that he had made war not only on the Romans,but previously on the Saguntines also, on his own individualresponsibility. That, if the question were viewed in its proper light,it would be found that the league between the senate and people ofCarthage and the Romans remained unbroken up to that day. Accordingly,all they had in charge to solicit was, that they might be allowed tocontinue in the enjoyment of that peace which was last entered intowith the consul Caius Lutatius. When the praetor, according tothe custom handed down from their ancestors, had given the fatherspermission to ask the ambassadors any questions they might be pleasedto put, and the older members who had been present at the makingof the treaties had put some one question and others another, theambassadors declared that they were not old enough to recollect, forthey were nearly all of them young men. Upon this every part of thesenate-house resounded with exclamations, that with Carthaginianknavery men had been chosen to solicit a renewal of the old peace whodid not recollect its terms."Book 30,Chapter 23,"After this, the ambassadors having been removed out of thesenate-house, the senators began to be asked their opinions. MarcusLivius recommended, that Caius Servilius, the consul nearest home,should be sent for, that he might be present at the proceedingsrelative to the peace; for as it was impossible that any subject ofdeliberation could occur of greater importance than the present, hedid not see how it could be discussed, consistently with the dignityof the Roman people, in the absence of one or both of the consuls.Quintus Metellus, who three years before had been consul, and hadfilled the office of dictator, said that, since Publius Scipio, bydestroying the armies and by devastating the lands of the enemy, hadreduced them to such a state that they were compelled as supplicantsto sue for peace; and as no one could estimate with more truth theintentions with which it was solicited, than he who was prosecutingthe war before the gates of Carthage; the peace should be rejectedor adopted on the advice of none other than Scipio. Marcus ValeriusLaevinus, who had been twice consul, endeavoured to show that thosewho had come were spies, and not ambassadors; that they ought to beordered to depart from Italy; that guards should be sent with them totheir very ships, and that Scipio should be written to not to relaxin prosecuting the war. Laelius and Fulvius added, that Scipio hadgrounded his hopes of effecting a peace on Hannibal and Mago notbeing recalled from Italy. He considered that the Carthaginians wouldpractise every species of dissimulation, in expectation of thearrival of those generals and their armies, and then, forgetful of alltreaties, however recent, and all gods, would proceed with the war.For these reasons they were the more disposed to adopt the opinion ofLaevinus. The ambassadors were dismissed without having accomplishedthe peace, and almost without an answer."Book 30,Chapter 24,"About the same time Cneius Servilius, the consul, not doubting butthat he should enjoy the glory of having restored Italy to a state ofpeace, pursued Hannibal, whom he considered had fled before him, andcrossed over into Sicily, with the intention of proceeding thence intoAfrica. As soon as this became known at Rome, at first the fathersgave it as their opinion, that the praetor should inform the consulby letter that the senate thought it proper that he should return intoItaly; but afterwards, the praetor declaiming that he would not heedhis letter, Publius Sulpicius, who was created dictator for thisvery purpose, recalled the consul to Italy, in virtue of his superiorauthority. The remainder of the year he employed in conjunction withMarcus Servilius, his master of the horse, in going round to thecities of Italy, which had been alienated from the Romans during thewar, and in taking cognizance of the cases of each. During the time ofthe truce, Lentulus the praetor sent over into Africa, from Sardinia,a hundred transports with stores, under a convoy of twenty ships ofwar, without meeting with any injury either from the enemy or storms.The same good fortune did not attend Cneius Octavius, while crossingover from Sicily with two hundred transports and thirty men of war.Having experienced a prosperous voyage until he arrived almost withinsight of Africa, at first the wind dropped, but afterwards changing tothe south-west, it dispersed his ships in every direction. He himselfwith the ships of war, having struggled through the opposing billowsby the extraordinary exertions of his rowers, made the promontory ofApollo. The greater part of the transports were driven to Aegimurus,an island filling the mouth of the bay on which Carthage stands,and about thirty miles from the city; the rest were driven on shoredirectly opposite the city, near the warm baths. The whole occurrencewas within sight of Carthage, and, accordingly, the people ran incrowds to the forum, from every part of the city. The magistratessummoned the senate, and the people were yelling in the vestibule ofthe senate-house, lest so great a booty should escape from their handsand their sight. Though some urged as an objection the obligationimposed upon them by having solicited peace, and others the restraintoccasioned by the existence of a truce, the period of which had notyet expired, it was agreed in an assembly, made up almost of amixture of the senate and people, that Hasdrubal should cross over toAegimurus with fifty ships, and, proceeding thence, pick up the Romanships scattered along the coasts and in the different ports. First thetransports from Aegimurus, and then those from the baths, abandoned bythe crews, were towed to Carthage."Book 30,Chapter 25,"The ambassadors had not as yet returned from Rome, nor was itknown whether the Roman senate had pronounced in favour of peaceor war; nor as yet had the period of the truce expired. Scipio,therefore, considering that the malignity of their offence washeightened by the fact, that, though they had solicited peace anda truce, they had cut off all hopes of the former and violated thelatter, immediately despatched Lucius Baebius, Lucius Sergius, andLucius Fabius, as ambassadors to Carthage. These, having narrowlyescaped violence from the assembled multitude, and perceiving thatthey would be exposed to similar danger on their return, requested ofthe magistrates, by whose aid they had been protected from violence,to send ships to escort them. Two triremes were assigned them, which,when they had come to the river Bagradas, whence the Roman camp couldbe seen, returned to Carthage. The Carthaginian fleet was stationed atUtica, and from this three quadriremes were despatched, which suddenlyattacked the Roman quinquereme from the main sea, while doubling thepromontory, either owing to a message sent from Carthage thatthis should be done, or that Hasdrubal, who commanded the fleet,perpetrated the atrocity without public connivance. But neither couldthey strike it with their beaks from the rapidity with which it evadedthem, nor could the fighting men board the higher from lower vessels.The quinquereme was gallantly defended as long as their weaponslasted; but these failing, and there being now nothing which couldsave them but the nearness of the land, and the multitude which hadpoured out from the camp upon the shore, they communicated a rapidmotion to the vessel by means of their oars, and running her againstthe shore with all the force they could, they escaped themselveswithout injury, and only lost the vessel. Thus when the truce hadbeen unequivocally violated by repeated acts of villany, Laelius andFulvius arrived from Rome with the Carthaginian ambassadors. Scipiotold them, that although the Carthaginians had not only broken theirfaith pledged in the truce, but had also violated the laws of nationsin the persons of his ambassadors, yet he would not in their casedo any thing unworthy of the maxims of the Roman people or his ownprinciples; after saying which, he dismissed the ambassadors andprepared for war. When Hannibal was now drawing near land, one of thesailors, who was ordered to climb the mast to see what part of thecountry they were making, said the prow pointed toward a demolishedsepulchre, when Hannibal, recognising the inauspicious omen, orderedthe pilot to steer by that place, and putting in his fleet at Leptis,landed his forces there."Book 30,Chapter 26,"Such were the transactions in Africa this year. Those whichfollowed extended themselves into that year in which Marcus ServiliusGeminus, who was then master of the horse and Tiberius Claudius Nerowere consuls. However, at the close of the former year, deputies fromthe allied states in Greece having arrived with complaints that theirlands had been devastated by the king's garrisons, and that theirambassadors, who had gone into Macedonia to demand restitution hadnot been admitted into the presence of Philip; and having also broughtinformation that four thousand men were said to have been conveyedover into Africa, under the conduct of Sopater, to assist theCarthaginians, and that a considerable quantity of money had been sentwith them; the senate resolved that ambassadors should be sent to theking to inform him that the fathers considered that these acts werecontrary to the treaty. The persons sent were Caius Terentius Varro,Caius Mamilius, and Marcus Aurelius. Three quinqueremes were assignedto them. This year was rendered remarkable by a most extensive fire,by which the buildings on the Publician hill were burned to theground, and by the greatness of the floods. But still provisions werecheap, not only because, as it was a time of peace, supplies could beobtained from every part of Italy, but also because Marcus ValeriusFalto and Marcus Fabius Buteo, the curule aediles, distributed to thepeople, so much for each street, at the rate of four _asses_ a bushel,a great quantity of corn which had been sent out of Spain. The sameyear died Quintus Fabius Maximus at an advanced age, if, indeed, it betrue that he was augur sixty-two years, which some historians relate.He was a man unquestionably worthy of the high surname which he bore,even had it begun with him. He surpassed the honours of his father,and equalled those of his grandfather. His grandfather, Rullus, wasdistinguished by a greater number of victories and more importantbattles; but one antagonist like Hannibal is sufficient tocounterbalance them all. He was esteemed rather cautious thanspirited; and though it may be questioned whether he was naturallydilatory, or whether he adopted that kind of conduct because it waspeculiarly suited to the war which he was carrying on, yet nothing canbe more clear that he was that one man who by his delay retrievedour affairs, as Ennius says. Quintus Fabius Maximus, his son, wasconsecrated augur in his room. In the room of the same, for he heldtwo priesthoods, Servius Sulpicius Galba was consecrated pontiff.The Roman games were repeated for one day, the plebeian were thricerepeated entire by the aediles, Marcus Sextius Sabinus and CneiusTremellius Flaccus. Both these were elected praetors, and with themCaius Livius Salinator and Caius Aurelius Cotta. The difference in theaccounts of historians renders it uncertain whether Caius Serviliusthe consul presided in the elections this year, or Publius Sulpicius,nominated dictator by him, because business detained him in Etruria;being engaged, according to a decree of the senate, in makinginquisitions respecting the conspiracies of the principal inhabitants."Book 30,Chapter 27,"In the beginning of the following year, Marcus Servilius andTiberius Claudius, having assembled the senate, consulted themrespecting the provinces. As both were desirous of having Africa, theywished Italy and Africa to be disposed of by lots; but, principally inconsequence of the exertions of Quintus Metellus, Africa was neitherassigned to any one nor withheld. The consuls were ordered to makeapplication to the tribunes of the people, to the effect, that, ifthey thought proper, they should put it to the people to decide whomthey wished to conduct the war in Africa. All the tribes nominatedPublius Scipio. Nevertheless, the consuls put the province of Africato the lot, for so the senate had decreed. Africa fell to the lot ofTiberius Claudius, who was to cross over into Africa with a fleet offifty ships, all quinqueremes, and have an equal command with Scipio.Marcus Servilius obtained Etruria. Caius Servilius was continued incommand in the same province, in case the senate resolved that theconsul should remain at the city. Of the praetors, Marcus Sextusobtained Gaul; which province, together with two legions, PubliusQuinctilius Varus was to deliver to him; Caius Livius obtainedBruttium, with the two legions which Publius Sempronius, theproconsul, had commanded the former year; Cneius Tremellius hadSicily, and was to receive the province and two legions fromPublius Villius Tappulus, a praetor of the former year; Villius, aspropraetor, was to protect the coast of Sicily with twenty men of war,and a thousand soldiers; and Marcus Pomponius was to convey thenceto Rome one thousand five hundred soldiers, with the remaining twentyships. The city jurisdiction fell to Caius Aurelius Cotta; and therest of the praetors were continued in command of the respectiveprovinces and armies which they then had. Not more than sixteenlegions were employed this year in the defence of the empire. And,that they might have the gods favourably disposed towards them in alltheir undertakings and proceedings, it was ordered that the consuls,before they set out to the war, should celebrate those games, andsacrifice those victims of the larger sort, which, in the consulateof Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Titus Quinctius, Titus Manlius, thedictator, had vowed, provided the commonwealth should continue in thesame state for the next five years. The games were exhibited in thecircus during four days, and the victims sacrificed to those deitiesto whom they had been vowed."Book 30,Chapter 28,"Meanwhile, hope and anxiety daily and simultaneously increased;nor could the minds of men be brought to any fixed conclusion, whetherit was a fit subject for rejoicing, that Hannibal had now at length,after the sixteenth year, departed from Italy, and left the Romans inthe unmolested possession of it, or whether they had not greater causeto fear, from his having transported his army in safety into Africa.They said that the scene of action certainly was changed, but not thedanger. That Quintus Fabius, lately deceased, who had foretold howarduous the contest would be, was used to predict, not without goodreason, that Hannibal would prove a more formidable enemy in his owncountry than he had been in a foreign one; and that Scipio would haveto encounter not Syphax, a king of undisciplined barbarians, whosearmies Statorius, a man little better than a soldier's drudge, wasused to lead; nor his father-in-law, Hasdrubal, that most fugaciousgeneral; nor tumultuary armies hastily collected out of a crowd ofhalf-armed rustics, but Hannibal, born in a manner in the pavilionof his father, that bravest of generals, nurtured and educated inthe midst of arms, who served as a soldier formerly, when a boy, andbecame a general when he had scarcely attained the age of manhood;who, having grown old in victory, had filled Spain, Gaul, and Italy,from the Alps to the strait, with monuments of his vast achievements;who commanded troops who had served as long as he had himself; troopshardened by the endurance of every species of suffering, such as itis scarcely credible that men could have supported; stained a thousandtimes with Roman blood, and bearing with them the spoils not only ofsoldiers but of generals. That many would meet the eyes of Scipio inbattle who had with their own hands slain Roman praetors, generals,and consuls; many decorated with crowns, in reward for having scaledwalls and crossed ramparts; many who had traversed the captured campsand cities of the Romans. That the magistrates of the Roman peoplehad not then so many fasces as Hannibal could have carried before him,having taken them from generals whom he had slain. While their mindswere harassed by these apprehensions, their anxiety and fears werefurther increased from the circumstance, that, whereas they had beenaccustomed to carry on war for several years, in different parts ofItaly, and within their view, with languid hopes, and without theprospect of bringing it to a speedy termination, Scipio and Hannibalhad stimulated the minds of all, as generals prepared for a finalcontest. Even those persons whose confidence in Scipio and hopesof victory were great, were affected with anxiety, increasing inproportion as they saw their completion approaching. The state offeeling among the Carthaginians was much the same; for, when theyturned their eyes on Hannibal, and the greatness of his achievements,they repented having solicited peace; but when again they reflectedthat they had been twice defeated in a pitched battle, that Syphax hadbeen made prisoner, that they had been driven out of Spain and Italy,and that all this had been effected by the valour and conduct ofScipio alone, they regarded him with horror, as a general marked outby destiny, and born, for their destruction."Book 30,Chapter 29,"Hannibal had by this time arrived at Adrumetum; from which place,after employing a few days there in refreshing his soldiers, who hadsuffered from the motion by sea, he proceeded by forced marches toZama, roused by the alarming statements of messengers, who broughtword, that all the country around Carthage was filled with armedtroops. Zama is distant from Carthage a five days' journey. Somespies, whom he sent out from this place, being intercepted by theRoman guard, and brought before Scipio, he directed that they shouldbe handed over to the military tribunes, and after having been desiredfearlessly to survey every thing, to be conducted through the campwherever they chose; then, asking them whether they had examined everything to their satisfaction, he assigned them an escort, and sent themback to Hannibal. Hannibal received none of the circumstances whichwere reported to him with feelings of joy; for they brought word that,as it happened, Masinissa had joined the enemy that very day, withsix thousand infantry and four thousand horse; but he was principallydispirited by the confidence of his enemy, which, doubtless, was notconceived without some ground. Accordingly, though he himself was theoriginator of the war, and by his coming had upset the truce which hadbeen entered into, and cut off all hopes of a treaty, yet concludingthat more favourable terms might be obtained if he solicited peacewhile his strength was unimpaired, than when vanquished, he sent amessage to Scipio, requesting permission to confer with him. I haveno means of affirming whether he did this on his own spontaneoussuggestion, or by the advice of his state. Valerius Antias says,that after having been beaten by Scipio in a battle, in which twelvethousand armed men were slain, and one thousand seven hundred madeprisoners, he came himself with ten other deputies into the campto Scipio. However, as Scipio did not decline the proposal for aconference, both the generals, by concert, brought their camps forwardin order to facilitate their meeting by shortening the distance.Scipio took up his position not far from the city Naragara, in asituation convenient not only for other purposes, but also becausethere was a watering place within a dart's throw. Hannibal tookpossession of an eminence four miles thence, safe and convenient inevery respect, except that he had a long way to go for water. Here,in the intermediate space, a place was chosen, open to view from allsides, that there might be no opportunity for treachery."Book 30,Chapter 30,"Their armed attendants having retired to an equal distance, theymet, each attended by one interpreter, being the greatest generals notonly of their own times, but of any to be found in the records of thetimes preceding them, and equal to any of the kings or generals ofany nation whatever. When they came within sight of each other theyremained silent for a short time, thunderstruck, as it were, withmutual admiration. At length Hannibal thus began: ""Since fate hath soordained it, that I, who was the first to wage war upon the Romans,and who have so often had victory almost within my reach, shouldvoluntarily come to sue for peace, I rejoice that it is you, above allothers, from whom it is my lot to solicit it. To you, also, amid themany distinguished events of your life, it will not be esteemed oneof the least glorious, that Hannibal, to whom the gods had so oftengranted victory over the Roman generals, should have yielded toyou; and that you should have put an end to this war, which has beenrendered remarkable by your calamities before it was by ours. In thisalso fortune would seem to have exhibited a disposition to sport withevents, for it was when your father was consul that I first took uparms; he was the first Roman general with whom I engaged in a pitchedbattle; and it is to his son that I now come unarmed to solicit peace.It were indeed most to have been desired, that the gods should haveput such dispositions into the minds of our fathers, that you shouldhave been content with the empire of Italy, and we with thatof Africa: nor, indeed, even to you, are Sicily and Sardinia ofsufficient value to compensate you for the loss of so many fleets, somany armies, so many and such distinguished generals. But what is pastmay be more easily censured than retrieved. In our attempts to acquirethe possessions of others we have been compelled to fight for our own;and not only have you had a war in Italy, and we also in Africa, butyou have beheld the standards and arms of your enemies almost inyour gates and on your walls, and we now, from the walls of Carthage,distinctly hear the din of a Roman camp. What, therefore, we shouldmost earnestly deprecate, and you should most devoutly wish for, isnow the case: peace is proposed at a time when you have the advantage.We who negotiate it are the persons whom it most concerns to obtainit, and we are persons whose arrangements, be they what they will,our states will ratify. All we want is a disposition not aversefrom peaceful counsels. As far as relates to myself, time, (for Iam returning to that country an old man which I left a boy,) andprosperity, and adversity, have so schooled me, that I am moreinclined to follow reason than fortune. But I fear your youth anduninterrupted good fortune, both of which are apt to inspire a degreeof confidence ill comporting with pacific counsels. Rarely doesthat man consider the uncertainty of events whom fortune hath neverdeceived. What I was at Trasimenus, and at Cannae, that you are thisday. Invested with command when you had scarcely yet attainedthe military age, though all your enterprises were of the boldestdescription, in no instance has fortune deserted you. Avenging thedeath of your father and uncle, you have derived from the calamity ofyour house the high honour of distinguished valour and filial duty.You have recovered Spain, which had been lost, after driving thencefour Carthaginian armies. When elected consul, though all otherswanted courage to defend Italy, you crossed over into Africa; wherehaving cut to pieces two armies, having at once captured and burnt twocamps in the same hour; having made prisoner Syphax, a most powerfulking, and seized so many towns of his dominions and so many of ours,you have dragged me from Italy, the possession of which I had firmlyheld for now sixteen years. Your mind, I say, may possibly be moredisposed to conquest than peace. I know the spirits of your countryaim rather at great than useful objects. On me, too, a similar fortuneonce shone. But if with prosperity the gods would also bestow upon ussound judgment, we should not only consider those things which havehappened, but those also which may occur. Even if you should forgetall others, I am myself a sufficient instance of every vicissitudeof fortune. For me, whom a little while ago you saw advancing mystandards to the walls of Rome, after pitching my camp between theAnio and your city, you now behold here, bereft of my two brothers,men of consummate bravery, and most renowned generals, standingbefore the walls of my native city, which is all but besieged, anddeprecating, in behalf of my own city, those severities with which Iterrified yours. In all cases, the most prosperous fortune is least tobe depended upon. While your affairs are in a favourable and ours ina dubious state, you would derive honour and splendour from grantingpeace; while to us who solicit it, it would considered as necessaryrather than honourable. A certain peace is better and safer than avictory in prospect; the former is at your own disposal, the latterdepends upon the gods. Do not place at the hazard of a single hour thesuccesses of so many years. When you consider your own strength, thenalso place before your view the power of fortune, and the fluctuatingnature of war. On both sides there will be arms, on both sides humanbodies. In nothing less than in war do events correspond (with men'scalculations). Should you be victorious in a battle, you will not addso much to that renown which you now have it in your power to acquireby granting peace, as you will detract from it should any adverseevent befall you. The chance of a single hour may at once overturn thehonours you have acquired and those you anticipate. Every thing is atyour own disposal in adjusting a peace; but, in the other case, youmust be content with that fortune which the gods shall impose uponyou. Formerly, in this same country, Marcus Atilius would have formedone among the few instances of good fortune and valour, if, whenvictorious, he had granted a peace to our fathers when they requestedit; but by not setting any bounds to his success, and not checkinggood fortune, which was elating him, he fell with a degree of ignominyproportioned to his elevation. It is indeed the right of him whogrants, and not of him who solicits it, to dictate the terms of peace;but perhaps we may not be unworthy to impose upon ourselves the fine.We do not refuse that all those possessions on account of which thewar was begun should be yours; Sicily, Sardinia, Spain, with all theislands lying in any part of the sea, between Africa and Italy. Let usCarthaginians, confined within the shores of Africa, behold you, sincesuch is the pleasure of the gods, extending your empire over foreignnations, both by sea and land. I cannot deny that you have reason tosuspect the Carthaginian faith, in consequence of their insinceritylately in soliciting a peace and while awaiting the decision. Thesincerity with which a peace will be observed, depends much, Scipio,on the person by whom it is sought. Your senate, as I hear, refused togrant a peace in some measure because the deputies were deficient inrespectability. It is I, Hannibal, who now solicit peace; who wouldneither ask for it unless I believed it expedient, nor will I failto observe it for the same reason of expedience on account of whichI have solicited it. And in the same manner as I, because the war wascommenced by me, brought it to pass that no one regretted it till thegods began to regard me with displeasure; so will I also exert myselfthat no one may regret the peace procured by my means."""Book 30,Chapter 31,"In answer to these things the Roman general spoke nearly to thefollowing effect: ""I was aware that it was in consequence of theexpectation of your arrival, that the Carthaginians violated theexisting faith of the truce and broke off all hope of a peace. Nor,indeed, do you conceal the fact; inasmuch as you artfully withdrawfrom the former conditions of peace every concession except whatrelates to those things which have for a long time been in our ownpower. But as it is your object, that your countrymen should besensible how great a burden they are relieved from by your means, soit is incumbent upon me to endeavour that they may not receive, asthe reward of their perfidy, the concessions which they formerlystipulated, by expunging them now from the conditions of the peace.Though you do not deserve to be allowed the same conditions as before,you now request even to be benefited by your treachery. Neither didour fathers first make war respecting Sicily, nor did we respectingSpain. In the former case the danger which threatened our allies theMamertines, and in the present the destruction of Saguntum, girdedus with just and pious arms. That you were the aggressors, both youyourselves confess, and the gods are witnesses, who determinedthe issue of the former war, and who are now determining and willdetermine the issue of the present according to right and justice. Asto myself, I am not forgetful of the instability of human affairs,but consider the influence of fortune, and am well aware that allour measures are liable to a thousand casualties. But as I shouldacknowledge that my conduct would savour of insolence and oppression,if I rejected you on your coming in person to solicit peace, beforeI crossed over into Africa, you voluntarily retiring from Italy, andafter you had embarked your troops; so now, when I have dragged youinto Africa almost by manual force, notwithstanding your resistanceand evasions, I am not bound to treat you with any respect. Wherefore,if in addition to those stipulations on which it was considered that apeace would at that time have been agreed upon, and what they are youare informed, a compensation is proposed for having seized our ships,together with their stores, during a truce, and for the violenceoffered to our ambassadors, I shall then have matter to lay before mycouncil. But if these things also appear oppressive, prepare for war,since you could not brook the conditions of peace."" Thus, withouteffecting an accommodation, when they had returned from the conferenceto their armies, they informed them that words had been bandied to nopurpose, that the question must be decided by arms, and that they mustaccept that fortune which the gods assigned them."Book 30,Chapter 32,"When they had arrived at their camps, they both issued orders thattheir soldiers should get their arms in readiness, and prepare theirminds for the final contest; in which, if fortune should favour them,they would continue victorious, not for a single day, but for ever.""Before to-morrow night,"" they said, ""they would know whether Rome orCarthage should give laws to the world; and that neither Africa norItaly, but the whole world, would be the prize of victory. That thedangers which threatened those who had the misfortune to be defeated,were proportioned to the rewards of the victors."" For the Romans hadnot any place of refuge in an unknown and foreign land, and immediatedestruction seemed to await Carthage, if the troops which formedher last reliance were defeated. To this important contest, theday following, two generals, by far the most renowned of any, andbelonging to two of the most powerful nations in the world, advanced,either to crown or overthrow, on that day, the many honours they hadpreviously acquired. Their minds, therefore, were agitated with theopposite feelings of hope and fear; and while they contemplated atone time their own troops, at another those of their enemy, estimatingtheir powers more by sight than by reason, they saw in them at oncethe grounds for joy and grief. Those circumstances which did not occurto the troops themselves spontaneously, their generals suggested bytheir admonitions and exhortations. The Carthaginian recounted hisachievements in the land of Italy during sixteen years the many Romangenerals and armies annihilated, reminding each individually of thehonours he had acquired as he came to any soldier who had obtaineddistinction in any of his battles. Scipio referred to Spain, therecent battles in Africa and the enemy's own confession, that theycould not through fear but solicit peace, nor could they, throughtheir inveterate perfidy, abide by it. In addition to this he gavewhat turn he pleased to his conference with Hannibal, which was heldin private, and was therefore open to misrepresentation. He auguredsuccess that the gods had exhibited the same omens to them on goingout to battle on the present occasion, as they had to their fatherswhen they fought at the islands Aegates. He told them that thetermination of the war, and their hardships, had arrived; that theyhad within their grasp the spoils of Carthage, and the power ofreturning home to their country, their parents, their children, theirwives, and their household gods. He delivered these observations witha body so erect, and with a countenance so full of exultation, thatone would have supposed that he had already conquered. He then drew uphis troops, posting the hastati in front, the principes behind them,and closing his rear line with the triarii."Book 30,Chapter 33,"He did not draw up his cohorts in close order, but each beforetheir respective standards; placing the companies at some distancefrom each other, so as to leave a space through which the elephants ofthe enemy passing might not at all break their ranks. Laelius, whom hehad employed before as lieutenant-general, but this year as quaestor,by special appointment, according to a decree of the senate, he postedwith the Italian cavalry in the left wing, Masinissa and the Numidiansin the right. The open spaces between the companies of those in thevan he filled with velites, which then formed the Roman light-armedtroops, with an injunction, that on the charge of the elephants theyshould either retire behind the files, which extended in a right line,or, running to the right and left and placing themselves by the sideof those in the van, afford a passage by which the elephants mightrush in between weapons on both sides. Hannibal, in order to terrifythe enemy, drew up his elephants in front, and he had eighty ofthem, being more than he had ever had in any battle; behind these hisLigurian and Gallic auxiliaries, with Balearians and Moors intermixed.In the second line he placed the Carthaginians, Africans, and a legionof Macedonians; then, leaving a moderate interval, he formed a reserveof Italian troops, consisting principally of Bruttians, more ofwhom had followed him on his departure from Italy by compulsion andnecessity than by choice. His cavalry also he placed in the wings, theCarthaginian occupying the right, the Numidian the left. Various werethe means of exhortation employed in an army consisting of a mixtureof so many different kinds of men; men differing in language, customslaws, arms, dress, and appearance, and in the motives for serving.To the auxiliaries, the prospect both of their present pay, and manytimes more from the spoils, was held out. The Gauls were stimulatedby their peculiar and inherent animosity against the Romans. To theLigurians the hope was held out of enjoying the fertile plains ofItaly, and quitting their rugged mountains, if victorious. The Moorsand Numidians were terrified with subjection to the government ofMasinissa, which he would exercise with despotic severity. Differentgrounds of hope and fear were represented to different persons. Theview of the Carthaginians was directed to the walls of their city,their household gods, the sepulchres of their ancestors, theirchildren and parents, and their trembling wives; they were told, thateither the destruction of their city and slavery or the empire of theworld awaited them; that there was nothing intermediate which theycould hope for or fear. While the general was thus busily employedamong the Carthaginians, and the captains of the respective nationsamong their countrymen, most of them employing interpreters amongtroops intermixed with those of different nations, the trumpets andcornets of the Romans sounded; and such a clamour arose, that theelephants, especially those in the left wing, turned round upon theirown party, the Moors and Numidians. Masinissa had no difficulty inincreasing the alarm of the terrified enemy, and deprived them of theaid of their cavalry in that wing. A few, however, of the beasts whichwere driven against the enemy, and were not turned back through fear,made great havoc among the ranks of the velites, though not withoutreceiving many wounds themselves; for when the velites, retiring tothe companies, had made way for the elephants, that they might not betrampled down, they discharged their darts at them, exposed as theywere to wounds on both sides, those in the van also keeping up acontinual discharge of javelins; until, driven out of the Roman lineby the weapons which fell upon them from all quarters, these elephantsalso put to flight even the cavalry of the Carthaginians posted intheir right wing. Laelius, when he saw the enemy in disorder, struckadditional terror into them in their confusion."Book 30,Chapter 34,"The Carthaginian line was deprived of the cavalry on bothsides, when the infantry, who were now not a match for the Romans inconfidence or strength, engaged. In addition to this there was onecircumstance, trifling in itself, but at the same time producingimportant consequences in the action. On the part of the Romans theshout was uniform, and on that account louder and more terrific; whilethe voices of the enemy, consisting as they did of many nations ofdifferent languages, were dissonant. The Romans used the stationarykind of fight, pressing upon the enemy with their own weight and thatof their arms; but on the other side there was more of skirmishingand rapid movement than force. Accordingly, on the first charge,the Romans immediately drove back the line of their opponents; thenpushing them with their elbows and the bosses of their shields, andpressing forward into the places from which they had pushed them,they advanced a considerable space, as though there had been no one toresist them, those who formed the rear urging forward those infront when they perceived the line of the enemy giving way; whichcircumstance itself gave great additional force in repelling them. Onthe side of the enemy, the second line, consisting of the Africans andCarthaginians, were so far from supporting the first line when givingground, that, on the contrary, they even retired, lest their enemy,by slaying those who made a firm resistance, should penetrate tothemselves also. Accordingly, the auxiliaries suddenly turned theirbacks, and facing about upon their own party, fled, some of them intothe second line, while others slew those who did not receive them intotheir ranks, since before they did not support them, and now refusedto receive them. And now there were, in a manner, two contests goingon together, the Carthaginians being compelled to fight at once withthe enemy and with their own party. Not even then, however, did theyreceive into their line the terrified and exasperated troops; but,closing their ranks, drove them out of the scene of action to thewings and the surrounding plain, lest they should mingle thesesoldiers, terrified with defeat and wounds, with that part of theirline which was firm and fresh. But such a heap of men and arms hadfilled the space in which the auxiliaries a little while ago hadstood, that it was almost more difficult to pass through it thanthrough a close line of troops. The spearmen, therefore, who formedthe front line, pursuing the enemy as each could find a way throughthe heap of arms and men, and streams of blood, threw into completedisorder the battalions and companies. The standards also of theprincipes had begun to waver when they saw the line before them drivenfrom their ground. Scipio, perceiving this, promptly ordered thesignal to be given for the spearmen to retreat, and, having taken hiswounded into the rear, brought the principes and triarii to the wings,in order that the line of spearmen in the centre might be more strongand secure. Thus a fresh and renewed battle commenced, inasmuch asthey had penetrated to their real antagonists, men equal to them inthe nature of their arms, in their experience in war, in the fame oftheir achievements, and the greatness of their hopes and fears. Butthe Romans were superior both in numbers and courage, for they had nowrouted both the cavalry and the elephants, and having already defeatedthe front line, were fighting against the second."Book 30,Chapter 35," Laelius and Masinissa, who had pursued the routed cavalry througha considerable space, returning very opportunely, charged the rear ofthe enemy's line. This attack of the cavalry at length routed them.Many of them, being surrounded, were slain in the field; and many,dispersed in flight through the open plain around, were slain onall hands, as the cavalry were in possession of every part. Of theCarthaginians and their allies, above twenty thousand were slain onthat day; about an equal number were captured, with a hundred andthirty-three military standards, and eleven elephants. Of the victorsas many as two thousand fell. Hannibal, slipping off during theconfusion, with a few horsemen came to Adrumetum, not quitting thefield till he had tried every expedient both in the battle and beforethe engagement; having, according to the admission of Scipio, andevery one skilled in military science, acquired the fame of havingmarshalled his troops on that day with singular judgment. He placedhis elephants in the front, in order that their desultory attack, andinsupportable violence, might prevent the Romans from following theirstandards, and preserving their ranks, on which they placed theirprincipal dependence. Then he posted his auxiliaries before the lineof Carthaginians, in order that men who were made up of the refuse ofall nations and who were not bound by honour but by gain, might nothave any retreat open to them in case they fled; at the same time thatthe first ardour and impetuosity might be exhausted upon them, and,if they could render no other service, that the weapons of the enemymight be blunted in wounding them. Next he placed the Carthaginianand African soldiers, on whom he placed all his hopes, in order that,being equal to the enemy in every other respect, they might have theadvantage of them, inasmuch as, being fresh and unimpaired in strengththemselves, they would fight with those who were fatigued and wounded.The Italians he removed into the rear, separating them also by anintervening space, as he knew not, with certainty, whether they werefriends or enemies. Hannibal, after performing this as it were hislast work of valour, fled to Adrumetum, whence, having been summonedto Carthage, he returned thither in the six and thirtieth year afterhe had left it when a boy; and confessed in the senate-house that hewas defeated, not only in the battle, but in the war, and that therewas no hope of safety in any thing but in obtaining peace."Book 30,Chapter 36,"Immediately after the battle, Scipio, having taken and plunderedthe enemy's camp, returned to the sea and his ships, with an immensebooty, news having reached him that Publius Lentulus had arrived atUtica with fifty men of war, and a hundred transports laden with everykind of stores. Concluding that he ought to bring before Carthageevery thing which could increase the consternation already existingthere, after sending Laelius to Rome to report his victory, he orderedCneius Octavius to conduct the legions thither by land; and, settingout himself from Utica with the fresh fleet of Lentulus, added tohis former one, made for the harbour of Carthage. When he had arrivedwithin a short distance, he was met by a Carthaginian ship decked withfillets and branches of olive. There were ten deputies, the leadingmen in the state, sent at the instance of Hannibal to solicit peace;to whom, when they had come up to the stern of the general's ship,holding out the badges of suppliants, entreating and imploring theprotection and compassion of Scipio, the only answer given was, thatthey must come to Tunes, to which place he would move his camp. Aftertaking a view of the site of Carthage, not so much for the sake ofacquainting himself with it for any present object, as to dispiritthe enemy, he returned to Utica, having recalled Octavius to thesame place. As they were proceeding thence to Tunes, they receivedintelligence that Vermina, the son of Syphax, with a greater number ofhorse than foot, was coming to the assistance of the Carthaginians.A part of his infantry, with all the cavalry, having attacked them ontheir march on the first day of the Saturnalia, routed the Numidianswith little opposition; and as every way by which they could escape inflight was blocked up, for the cavalry surrounded them on all sides,fifteen thousand men were slain, twelve hundred were taken alive, withfifteen hundred Numidian horses, and seventy-two military standards.The prince himself fled from the field with a few attendants duringthe confusion. The camp was then pitched near Tunes in the same placeas before, and thirty ambassadors came to Scipio from Carthage. Thesebehaved in a manner even more calculated to excite compassion than theformer, in proportion as their situation was more pressing; butfrom the recollection of their recent perfidy, they were heard withconsiderably less pity. In the council, though all were impelled byjust resentment to demolish Carthage, yet, when they reflected uponthe magnitude of the undertaking, and the length of time which wouldbe consumed in the siege of so well fortified and strong a city,while Scipio himself was uneasy in consequence of the expectation ofa successor, who would come in for the glory of having terminated thewar, though it was accomplished already by the exertions and danger ofanother, the minds of all were inclined to peace."Book 30,Chapter 37,"The next day the ambassadors being called in again, and withmany rebukes for their perfidy, warned that, instructed by so manydisasters, they would at length believe in the existence of the gods,and the obligation of an oath, these conditions of the peace werestated to them: ""That they should enjoy their liberty and live undertheir own laws; that they should possess such cities and territoriesas they had enjoyed before the war, and with the same boundaries, andthat the Romans should on that day desist from devastation. That theyshould restore to the Romans all deserters and fugitives, giving upall their ships of war except ten triremes, with such tamed elephantsas they had, and that they should not tame any more. That they shouldnot carry on war in or out of Africa without the permission of theRoman people. That they should make restitution to Masinissa, andform a league with him. That they should furnish corn, and pay for theauxiliaries until the ambassadors had returned from Rome. That theyshould pay ten thousand talents of silver, in equal annual instalmentsdistributed over fifty years. That they should give a hundredhostages, according to the pleasure of Scipio, not younger thanfourteen nor older than thirty. That he would grant them a truce oncondition that the transports, together with their cargoes, which hadbeen seized during the former truce, were restored. Otherwise theywould have no truce, nor any hope of a peace."" When the ambassadorswho were ordered to bear these conditions home reported them in anassembly, and Gisgo had stood forth to dissuade them from theterms, and was being listened to by the multitude, who were at onceindisposed for peace and unfit for war, Hannibal, indignant that suchlanguage should be held and listened to at such a juncture, laidhold of Gisgo with his own hand, and dragged him from his elevatedposition. This unusual sight in a free state having raised a murmuramong the people, the soldier, disconcerted at the liberties which thecitizens took, thus addressed them: ""Having left you when nine yearsold, I have returned after a lapse of thirty-six years. I flattermyself I am well acquainted with the qualifications of a soldier,having been instructed in them from my childhood, sometimes by my ownsituation, and sometimes by that of my country. The privileges, thelaws, and customs of the city and the forum you ought to teach me.""Having thus apologized for his indiscretion, he discoursed largelyconcerning the peace, showing how inoppressive the terms were, and hownecessary it was. The greatest difficulty was, that of the ships whichhad been seized during the truce nothing was to be found except theships themselves: nor was it easy to collect the property, becausethose who were charged with having it were opposed to the peace. Itwas resolved that the ships should be restored, and that the men atleast should be looked up; and as to whatever else was missing, thatit should be left to Scipio to put a value upon it, and that theCarthaginians should make compensation accordingly in money. Thereare those who say that Hannibal went from the field of battle to thesea-coast; whence he immediately sailed in a ship, which he had readyfor the purpose, to king Antiochus; and that when Scipio demandedabove every thing that Hannibal should be given up to him, answer wasmade that Hannibal was not in Africa."Book 30,Chapter 38,"After the ambassadors returned to Scipio, the quaestors wereordered to give in an account, made out from the public registers,of the public property which had been in the ships; and the ownersto make a return of the private property. For the amount of the valuetwenty-five thousand pounds of silver were required to be paid down;and a truce for three months was granted to the Carthaginians. Itwas added, that during the time of the truce they should notsend ambassadors any where else than to Rome; and that, whateverambassadors came to Carthage, they should not dismiss them beforeinforming the Roman general who they were, and what they sought. Withthe Carthaginian ambassadors, Lucius Veturius Philo, Marcus MarciusRalla, and Lucius Scipio, brother of the general, were sent to Rome.At the time in which these events took place, the supplies sent fromSicily and Sardinia produced such cheapness of provisions, that themerchant gave up the corn to the mariners for their freight. AtRome alarm was excited at the first intelligence of the renewal ofhostilities by the Carthaginians; and Tiberius Claudius was directedto conduct the fleet with speed into Sicily, and cross over from thatplace into Africa. The other consul, Marcus Servilius, was directed tostay at the city until the state of affairs in Africa was ascertained.Tiberius Claudius, the consul, proceeded slowly with every thingconnected with the equipment and sailing of the fleet, because thesenate had decided that it should be left to Scipio, rather than tothe consul, to determine the conditions on which the peace should begranted. The accounts also of prodigies which arrived just at the timeof the news of the revival of the war, had occasioned great alarm.At Cumae the orb of the sun seemed diminished, and a shower of stonesfell; and in the territory of Veliternum the earth sank in greatchasms, and trees were swallowed up in the cavities. At Aricia theforum and the shops around it, at Frusino a wall in several places,and a gate, were struck by lightning; and in the Palatium a shower ofstones fell. The latter prodigy, according to the custom handed downby tradition, was expiated by a nine days' sacred rite; the restwith victims of the larger sort. Amid these events an unusually greatrising of the waters was converted into a prodigy; for the Tiberoverflowed its banks to such a degree, that as the circus was underwater, the Apollinarian games were got up near the temple of VenusErycina, without the Colline gate. However, the weather suddenlyclearing up on the very day of the celebration, the procession, whichhad begun to move at the Colline gate, was recalled and transferred tothe circus, on its being known that the water had retired thence. Thejoy of the people and the attraction of the games were increased bythe restoration of this solemn spectacle to its proper scene."Book 30,Chapter 39,"The consul Claudius, having set out at length from the city,was placed in the most imminent danger by a violent tempest, whichovertook him between the ports of Cosa and Laurentum. Having reachedPopulonii, where he waited till the remainder of the tempest hadspent itself, he crossed over to the island Ilva. From Ilva he went toCorsica, and from Corsica to Sardinia. Here, while sailing round theMontes Insani, a tempest much more violent in itself, and in a moredangerous situation, dispersed his fleet. Many of his ships wereshattered and stripped of their rigging, and some were wrecked. Hisfleet thus weatherbeaten and shattered arrived at Carales, where thewinter came on while the ships were drawn on shore and refitted. Theyear having elapsed, and no one proposing to continue him in command,Tiberius Claudius brought back his fleet to Rome in a privatecapacity. Marcus Servilius set out for his province, having nominatedCaius Servilius Geminus as dictator, that he might not be recalled tothe city to hold the elections. The dictator appointed Publius AeliusPaetus master of the horse. It frequently happened, that the electionscould not be held on account of bad weather, though the days werefixed for them; and, therefore, as the magistrates of the former yearretired from their offices on the day before the ides of March, andfresh ones were not appointed to succeed them, the state was withoutcurule magistrates. Lucius Manlius Torquatus, a pontiff, died thisyear. Caius Sulpicius Galba was elected in his room. The Roman gameswere thrice repeated by the curule aediles, Lucius Licinius Lucullusand Quintus Fulvius. Some scribes and runners belonging to theaediles were found, on the testimony of an informer, to have privatelyconveyed money out of the treasury, and were condemned, not withoutdisgrace to the aedile Lucullus. Publius Aelius Tubero and LuciusLaetorius, plebeian aediles, on account of some informality in theircreation, abdicated their office, after having celebrated the games,and the banquet on occasion of the games, in honour of Jupiter, andafter having placed in the Capitol three statues made out of silverpaid as fines. The dictator and master of the horse celebrated thegames in honour of Ceres, in conformity with a decree of the senate."Book 30,Chapter 40,"The Roman, together with the Carthaginian ambassadors, havingarrived at Rome from Africa, the senate was assembled at the templeof Bellona; when Lucius Veturius Philo stated, to the great joy ofthe senate, that a battle had been fought with Hannibal, which wasdecisive of the fate of the Carthaginians, and that a period wasat length put to that calamitous war. He added what formed a smallaccession to their successes, that Vermina, the son of Syphax,had been vanquished. He was then ordered to go forth to the publicassembly, and impart the joyful tidings to the people. Then, athanksgiving having been appointed, all the temples in the citywere thrown open, and supplications for three days were decreed. Theambassadors of the Carthaginians, and those of king Philip, for theyalso had arrived, requesting an audience of the senate, answer wasmade by the dictator, by order of the fathers, that the new consulswould give them an audience. The elections were then held. The consulselected were Cneius Cornelius Lentulus and Publius Aelius Paetus.The praetors elected were Marcus Junius Pennus, to whose lot thecity jurisdiction fell, Marcus Valerius Falto, who received Bruttium,Marcus Fabius Buteo, who received Sardinia, and Publius Aelius Tubero,who received Sicily. It was the pleasure of the senate that nothingshould be done respecting the provinces of the consuls, till theambassadors of king Philip and the Carthaginians had been heard;for they foresaw the termination of one war and the commencementof another. Cneius Lentulus, the consul, was inflamed with a strongdesire to have the province of Africa, looking forward to an easyvictory if there was still war, or, if it was on the point of beingconcluded, to the glory of having it terminated in his consulate. Hetherefore refused to allow any business to be transacted before theprovince of Africa was assigned him; his colleague, who was a moderateand prudent man, giving up his claim to it, for he clearly saw thata contest with Scipio for that honour would be not only unjustbut unequal. Quintus Minucius Thermus, and Manius Acilius Glabrio,tribunes of the people, said that Cneius Cornelius was endeavouring toeffect the same object which had been attempted in vain by the consulTiberius Claudius the former year. That, by the direction of thesenate, it had been proposed to the people to decide whom they wishedto have the command in Africa, and all the thirty-five tribes hadconcurred in assigning that command to Publius Scipio. After manydiscussions, both in the senate and popular assembly, it was at lengthdetermined to leave it to the senate. The fathers, therefore, onoath, for so it had been agreed, voted, that as to the provinces, theconsuls should settle between themselves, or determine by lots, whichof them should have Italy, and which a fleet of fifty ships. That heto whose lot the fleet fell should sail to Sicily, and if peace couldnot be concluded with the Carthaginians, that he should cross overinto Africa. That the consul should act by sea, and Scipio by land,with the same right of command as heretofore. If an agreement shouldbe come to, as to the terms of the peace, that then the plebeiantribunes should consult the commons as to whether they ordered theconsul or Publius Scipio to grant the peace; and if the victoriousarmy was to be brought home out of Africa, whom they ordered to bringit. That if they ordered that the peace should be granted by PubliusScipio, and that the army should be brought home likewise by him, thenthe consul should not pass out of Sicily into Africa. That the otherconsul, to whose lot Italy fell, should receive two legions fromMarcus Sextius the praetor."Book 30,Chapter 41,"Publius Scipio was continued in command in the province of Africa,with the armies which he then had. To the praetor Marcus ValeriusFalto the two legions in Bruttium, which Caius Livius had commandedthe preceding year, were assigned. Publius Aelius, the praetor, was toreceive two legions in Sicily from Cneius Tremellius. To Marcus Fabiuswas assigned one legion, which Publius Lentulus, propraetor, hadcommanded, to be employed in Sardinia; Marcus Servilius, the consul ofthe former year, was continued in command in Etruria, with his owntwo legions likewise. As to Spain, it appeared that Lucius CorneliusLentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus had been there for now severalyears. It was resolved, therefore, that the consuls should makeapplication to the plebeian tribunes to take the opinion of thepeople, if they thought proper, as to whom they ordered to havecommand in Spain; that the person so ordered should form one legion ofRoman soldiers out of the two armies, and also fifteen cohorts ofthe allies of the Latin confederacy, with which he should occupy theprovince. That Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinusshould convey the old soldiers into Italy. To Cornelius, the consul,was assigned a fleet of fifty ships formed out of the two fleets, oneof which was under Cneius Octavius in Africa, the other employedin protecting the coast of Sicily, under Publius Villius. He was toselect such ships as he pleased. That Publius Scipio should stillhave the forty ships of war which he before had, or if he wished thatCneius Octavius should command it, as he had commanded a fleet therebefore, that Octavius should be continued in command for a year aspropraetor; but if he appointed Laelius to the command of it, Octaviusshould retire to Rome, and bring with him the ships which the consuldid not want. To Marcus Fabius also ten men of war were assigned forSardinia. The consuls were directed to enlist two city legions, sothat the operations of the state might be carried on this year withfourteen legions, and one hundred men of war."Book 30,Chapter 42,"Then the business relating to the ambassadors of Philip and theCarthaginians was considered. It was resolved that the Macedoniansshould be brought before the senate first. Their address comprehendeda variety of subjects, being employed partly in clearing themselvesfrom the charges relative to the depredations committed against theallies, which the deputies sent to the king from Rome had broughtagainst them; and partly in preferring accusations themselves againstthe allies of the Roman people, but particularly against MarcusAurelius, whom they inveighed against with much greater acrimony; forthey said that, being one of the three ambassadors sent to them,he had staid behind, and levying soldiers, had assailed them withhostilities contrary to the league, and frequently fought pitchedbattles with their prefects; and partly in preferring a request thatthe Macedonians and their general, Sopater, who had served in thearmy of Hannibal for hire, and having been made prisoners were keptin bondage, should be restored to them. In opposition to these thingsMarcus Furius, who had been sent from Macedonia for the expresspurpose by Aurelius, thus argued: he said, ""that Aurelius, havingbeen left behind, lest the allies of the Roman people, wearied bydevastations and injuries, should revolt to the king, had not gonebeyond the boundaries of the allies; but had taken measures to preventplundering parties from crossing over into their lands with impunity.That Sopater was one of those who wore purple, and was related tothe king; that he had been lately sent into Africa with fourthousand Macedonians and a sum of money to assist Hannibal and theCarthaginians."" The Macedonians, on being interrogated on thesepoints, proceeded to answer in a subtle and evasive manner; butwithout waiting for the conclusion of their reply they were told,""that the king was seeking occasion for war, and that if he persistedhe would soon obtain his object. That the treaty had been doublyviolated by him, both by offering insults to the allies of the Romanpeople, by assaulting them with hostilities and arms, and also byaiding their enemies with auxiliaries and money. That Publius Scipiowas deemed to have acted properly and regularly in keeping in chains,as enemies, those who had been made prisoners while bearing armsagainst the Romans; and that Marcus Aurelius had consulted theinterest of the state, and the senate were thankful to him for it, inprotecting the allies of the Roman people by arms, since he could notdo it by the obligation of the treaty."" The Macedonian ambassadorshaving been dismissed with this unpleasant answer, the Carthaginianambassadors were called. On observing their ages and dignifiedappearance, for they were by far the first men of the state, allpromptly declared their conviction, that now they were sincere intheir desire to effect a peace. Hasdrubal, however, surnamed by hiscountrymen Haedus, who had invariably recommended peace, and wasopposed to the Barcine faction, was regarded with greater interestthan the rest. On these accounts the greater weight was attached tohim when transferring the blame of the war from the state at large tothe cupidity of a few. After a speech of varied character, in which hesometimes refuted the charges which had been brought, at other timesadmitted some, lest by impudently denying what was manifestlytrue their forgiveness might be the more difficult; and then, evenadmonishing the conscript fathers to be guided by the rules of decorumand moderation in their prosperity, he said, that if the Carthaginianshad listened to himself and Hanno, and had been disposed to make aproper use of circumstances, they would themselves have dictatedterms of peace, instead of begging it as they now did. That it rarelyhappened that good fortune and a sound judgment were bestowed uponmen at the same time. That the Roman people were therefore invincible,because when successful they forgot not the maxims of wisdom andprudence; and indeed it would have been matter of astonishment didthey act otherwise. That those persons to whom success was a new anduncommon thing, proceeded to a pitch of madness in their ungovernedtransports in consequence of their not being accustomed to it. That tothe Roman people the joy arising from victory was a matter of commonoccurrence, and was now almost become old-fashioned. That theyhad extended their empire more by sparing the vanquished than byconquering. The language employed by the others was of a nature morecalculated to excite compassion; they represented from what a heightof power the Carthaginian affairs had fallen. That nothing, besidesthe walls of Carthage, remained to those who a little time ago heldalmost the whole world in subjection by their arms; that, shut upwithin these, they could see nothing any where on sea or land whichowned their authority. That they would retain possession of their cityitself and their household gods only, in case the Roman people shouldrefrain from venting their indignation upon these, which is all thatremains for them to do. When it was manifest that the fathers weremoved by compassion, it is said that one of the senators, violentlyincensed at the perfidy of the Carthaginians, immediately asked witha loud voice, by what gods they would swear in striking the league,since they had broken their faith with those by whom they swore instriking the former one? By those same, replied Hasdrubal, who haveshown such determined hostility to the violators of treaties."Book 30,Chapter 43,"The minds of all being disposed to peace, Cneius Lentulus, whoseprovince the fleet was, protested against the decree of the senate.Upon this, Manius Acilius and Quintus Minucius, tribunes of thepeople, put the question to the people, whether they willed andordered that the senate should decree that peace should be made withthe Carthaginians? whom they ordered to grant that peace, and whom toconduct the army out of Africa? All the tribes ordered respectingthe peace according as the question had been put. That Publius Scipioshould grant the peace, and that he also should conduct the armyhome. Agreeably to this order, the senate decreed that Publius Scipio,acting according to the opinion of the ten deputies, should makepeace with the Carthaginian people on what terms he pleased. TheCarthaginians then returned thanks to the senate, and requestedthat they might be allowed to enter the city and converse with theircountrymen who had been made prisoners and were in custody of thestate; observing, that some of them were their relations and friends,and men of rank, and some, persons to whom they were charged withmessages from their relations. Having obtained these requests, theyagain asked permission to ransom such of them as they pleased; whenthey were desired to give in their names. Having given in a list ofabout two hundred, a decree of the senate was passed to the effect,that the Carthaginian ambassadors should be allowed to take away intoAfrica to Publius Cornelius Scipio two hundred of the Carthaginianprisoners, selecting whom they pleased; and that they should conveyto him a message, that if the peace were concluded, he should restorethem to the Carthaginians without ransom. The heralds being; orderedto go into Africa to strike the league, at their own desire the senatepassed a decree that they should take with them flint stones of theirown, and vervain of their own; that the Roman praetor should commandthem to strike the league, and that they should demand of him herbs.The description of herb usually given to the heralds is taken from theCapitol. Thus the Carthaginians, being allowed to depart from Rome,when they had gone into Africa to Scipio concluded the peace on theterms before mentioned. They delivered up their men-of-war, theirelephants, deserters, fugitives, and four thousand prisoners, amongwhom was Quintus Terentius Culleo, a senator. The ships he ordered tobe taken out into the main and burnt. Some say there were five hundredof every description of those which are worked with oars, and that thesudden sight of these, when burning, occasioned as deep a sensationof grief to the Carthaginians as if Carthage had been in flames. Themeasures adopted respecting the deserters were more severe than thoserespecting the fugitives. Those who were of the Latin confederacy weredecapitated; the Romans were crucified."Book 30,Chapter 44,"The last peace with the Carthaginians was made forty years beforethis, in the consulate of Quintus Lutatius and Aulus Manlius. The warcommenced twenty-three years afterwards, in the consulate of PubliusCornelius and Tiberius Sempronius. It was concluded in the seventeenthyear, in the consulate of Cneius Cornelius and Publius Aelius Paetus.It is related that Scipio frequently said afterwards, that first theambition of Tiberius Claudius, and afterwards of Cneius Cornelius,were the causes which prevented his terminating the war by thedestruction of Carthage. The Carthaginians, finding difficulty inraising the first sum of money to be paid, as their finances wereexhausted by a protracted war, and in consequence great lamentationand grief arising in the senate-house, it is said that Hannibal wasobserved laughing; and when Hasdrubal Haedus rebuked him for laughingamid the public grief, when he himself was the occasion of the tearswhich were shed, he said: ""If, as the expression of the countenanceis discerned by the sight, so the inward feelings of the mind could bedistinguished, it would clearly appear to you that that laughter whichyou censure came from a heart not elated with joy, but frantic withmisfortunes. And yet it is not so ill-timed as those absurd andinconsistent tears of yours. Then you ought to have wept, when ourarms were taken from us, our ships burnt, and we were forbidden toengage in foreign wars, for that was the wound by which we fell. Noris it just that you should suppose that the measures which the Romanshave adopted towards you have been dictated by animosity. No greatstate can remain at rest long together. If it has no enemy abroadit finds one at home, in the same manner as over-robust bodiesseem secure from external causes, but are encumbered with their ownstrength. So far, forsooth, we are affected with the public calamitiesas they reach our private affairs; nor is there any circumstanceattending them which is felt more acutely than the loss of money.Accordingly, when the spoils were torn down from vanquished Carthage,when you beheld her left unarmed and defenceless amid so many armednations of Africa, none heaved a sigh. Now, because a tribute is to belevied from private property, you lament with one accord, as though atthe funeral of the state. How much do I dread lest you should soon bemade sensible that you have shed tears this day for the lightest ofyour misfortunes!"" Such were the sentiments which Hannibal deliveredto the Carthaginians. Scipio, having summoned an assembly, presentedMasinissa, in addition to his paternal dominions, with the town ofCirta, and the other cities and territories which had passed from thekingdom of Syphax into the possession of the Romans. He ordered CneiusOctavius to conduct the fleet to Sicily and deliver it to CneiusCornelius the consul, and directed the Carthaginian ambassadors to goto Rome, that the arrangements he had made, with the advice of theten deputies, might be ratified by the sanction of the fathers and theorder of the people."Book 30,Chapter 45,"Peace having been established by sea and land, he embarked histroops and crossed over to Lilybaeum in Sicily; whence, having senta great part of his soldiers by ships, he himself proceeded throughItaly, which was rejoicing, not less on account of the peace than thevictory; while not only the inhabitants of the cities poured out toshow him honour, but crowds of rustics thronged the roads. He arrivedat Rome and entered the city in a triumph of unparalleled splendour.He brought into the treasury one hundred and twenty-three thousandpounds of silver. He distributed to each of his soldiers four hundredasses out of the spoils. By the death of Syphax, which took place buta short time before at Tibur, whither he had been removed from Alba,a diminution was occasioned in the interest of the pageant rather thanin the glory of him who triumphed. His death, however, was attendedwith circumstances which produced a strong sensation, for he wasburied at the public expense. Polybius, an author by no means tobe despised, asserts that this king was led in the triumph. QuintusTerentius Culleo followed Scipio in his triumph with a cap of libertyon his head, and during the remainder of his life treated him with therespect due to him as the author of his freedom. I have not been ableto ascertain whether the partiality of the soldiers or the favour ofthe people fixed upon him the surname of Africanus, or whether in thesame manner as Felix was applied to Sulla, and Magnus to Pompey,in the memory of our fathers, it originated in the flattery of hisfriends. He was, doubtless, the first general who was distinguished bya name derived from the nation which he had conquered. Afterwards,in imitation of his example, some, by no means his equals in hisvictories, affixed splendid inscriptions on their statues and gavehonourable surnames to their families."Book 31,Chapter 1,"It is delightful even to me to have come to the end of the Punic war,as if I myself had borne a share of the toil and danger. For thoughit by no means becomes a person, who has ventured to promise an entirehistory of all the Roman affairs, to be fatigued by any particularparts of so extensive a work; yet when I reflect that sixty-threeyears (for so many there are from the first Punic war to the end ofthe second) have occupied as many of my volumes, as the four hundredand eighty-seven years, from the building of the city to the consulateof Appius Claudius, who first made war on the Carthaginians, I plainlyperceive that, like those who, tempted by the shallows near the shore,walk into the sea, the farther I advance, I am carried, as it were,into a greater depth and abyss; and that my work almost increases onmy hands which seemed to be diminished by the completion of each ofits earlier portions. The peace with Carthage was quickly followed bya war with Macedonia: a war, not to be compared to the former, indeed,either in danger, or in the abilities of the commander, or the valourof the soldiers; but almost more remarkable with regard to the renownof their former kings, the ancient fame of that nation, and the vastextent of their empire, in which they had formerly comprehended alarge part of Europe, and the greater part of Asia. The contest withPhilip, which had begun about ten years before, had been intermittedfor the three last years; the Aetolians having been the occasion bothof the war and the peace. The entreaties of the Athenians whom, havingravaged their lands, Philip had driven into their city, excited theRomans to a renewal of the war, left, as they were, disengaged bythe Carthaginian peace, and incensed against him as well for histreacherous negotiation of peace with the Aetolians and the otherallies in that region, as on account of the auxiliaries sent by himwith money into Africa to Hannibal and the Carthaginians."Book 31,Chapter 2,"About the same time, ambassadors arrived both from king Attalus,and from the Rhodians, with information that the Macedonian wastampering with the states of Asia. To these embassies an answer wasgiven, that the senate would give attention to the affairs of Asia.The determination with regard to the making war on him, was left opento the consuls, who were then in their provinces. In the mean time,three ambassadors were sent to Ptolemy, king of Egypt, namely,Caius Claudius Nero, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, and PubliusSempronius Tuditanus, to announce their conquest of Hannibal and theCarthaginians; to give thanks to the king for his faithful adherenceto his engagements in the time of their distress, when even thenearest allies of the Romans abandoned them; and to request that if,compelled by ill treatment, they should undertake a war with Philip,he would preserve his former disposition towards the Roman people. InGaul, about this time, the consul, Publius Aelius, having heard that,before his arrival, the Boians had made inroads on the territoriesof the allies, levied two occasional legions on account of thisdisturbance; and adding to them four cohorts from his own army,ordered Caius Oppius, the praefect, to march with this tumultuaryband through Umbria, (which is called the Sappinian district,) and toinvade the territories of the Boians. He himself led his own troopsthither openly, over the intervening mountains. Oppius, on enteringthe same, for some time committed depredations with tolerable successand safety. But afterwards, having pitched on a place near a fortcalled Mutilum, convenient enough for cutting down the corn, (forthe crops were now ripe,) and setting out without having reconnoitredaround, and without establishing armed posts of sufficient strengthto protect those who were unarmed and intent on their work, he wassuddenly surrounded, together with his foragers, by an unexpectedinvasion of the Gauls. On this, panic and flight seized even on thosewho were furnished with weapons. Seven thousand men, dispersed throughthe corn fields, were put to the sword, among whom was the commanderhimself, Caius Oppius. The rest were driven by terror into the camp;from whence, in consequence of a resolution of the soldiers, they setout on the following night, without any particular commander; and,leaving behind a great part of their baggage, made their way, throughwoods almost impassable, to the consul, who returned to Rome withouthaving performed any thing in his province worth notice, exceptthat he ravaged the lands of the Boians, and made a treaty with theIngaunian Ligurians."Book 31,Chapter 3,"The first time he assembled the senate, it was unanimously orderedthat he should propose no other business before that which related toPhilip and the complaints of the allies. It was immediately taken intoconsideration, and a numerous senate decreed, that Publius Aelius,consul, should send such person as he might think proper, vested withcommand, to receive the fleet which Cneius Octavius was bringing homefrom Sicily, and pass over to Macedonia. Accordingly Marcus ValeriusLaevinus, propraetor, was sent; and, receiving thirty-eight ships fromCneius Octavius, near Vibo, he sailed to Macedonia, where, whenMarcus Aurelius, the ambassador, had come to him and informed him whatnumerous forces and what large fleets the king had prepared, andhow he was arousing the inhabitants to arms, partly by visiting themhimself and partly by ambassadors, not only through all the cities ofthe continent, but even in the islands, (Laevinus was convinced) thatthe war ought to be undertaken by the Romans with greater vigour;lest, if they were dilatory, Philip might attempt that which hadbeen formerly undertaken by Pyrrhus, who possessed not such largedominions. He therefore desired Aurelius to convey this intelligenceby letter to the consuls and to the senate."Book 31,Chapter 4,"Towards the end of this year the senate, taking into considerationthe lands to be given to the veteran soldiers, who, under the conductand auspices of Publius Scipio, had finished the war in Africa,decreed that Marcus Tunius, praetor of the city, should, if he thoughtproper, appoint ten commissioners to survey, and distribute amongthem, that part of the Samnite and Apulian lands which was theproperty of the Roman people. For this purpose were appointed, PubliusServilius, Quintus Caecilius Metellus, Caius and Marcus Servilius,both surnamed Geminus, Lucius and Aulus Hostilius Cato, PubliusVillius Tappulus, Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, Publius Aelius Paetus, andQuintus Flaminius. At the same time, Publius Aelius presiding at theelection of consuls, Publius Sulpicius Galba and Caius Aurelius Cottawere elected. Then were chosen praetors, Quintus Minucius Rufus,Lucius Furius Purpureo, Quintus Fulvius Gillo, Cneius Sergius Plancus.The Roman stage-games were exhibited, in a sumptuous and elegantmanner, by the curule aediles, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, and LuciusQuintius Flaminius, and repeated for two days; and a vast quantity ofcorn, which Scipio had sent from Africa, was distributed by them tothe people, with strict impartiality and general satisfaction, at therate of four _asses_ a peck. The plebeian games were thrice repeatedentire by the plebeian aediles, Lucius Apustius Fullo, and QuintusMinucius Rufus; the latter of whom was, from the aedileship, electedpraetor. There was also a feast of Jove on occasion of the games."Book 31,Chapter 5,"In the year five hundred and fifty-two from the building of thecity, Publius Sulpicius Galba and Caius Aurelius being consuls, withina few months after the conclusion of the peace with the Carthaginians,the war was entered upon against king Philip. This was the firstbusiness introduced by the consul, Publius Sulpicius, on the ides ofMarch, the day on which, in those times, the consulship commenced; andthe senate decreed, that the consul should perform sacrifices withthe greater victims, to such gods as they should judge proper, withprayers to this purpose,--that ""the business which the senate andpeople of Rome had then under deliberation, concerning the state, andthe entering on a new war, might issue prosperously and happily to theRoman people, the allies, and the Latin confederacy;"" and that, afterthe sacrifices and prayers, they should consult the senate on thestate of public affairs, and the provinces. At this time, veryopportunely for exciting their minds to war, the letters were broughtfrom Marcus Aurelius, the ambassador, and Marcus Valerius Laevinus,propraetor. A fresh embassy, likewise, arrived from the Athenians, toacquaint them that the king was approaching their frontiers, and thatin a short time, not only their lands, but their city also, must fallinto his hands, unless they received aid from the Romans. When theconsuls had made their report, that the sacrifices had been dulyperformed, and that the gods had accepted their prayers; that thearuspices had declared that the entrails showed good omens, and thatenlargement of territory, victory, and triumph were portended; theletters of Valerius and Aurelius were read, and audience given to theambassadors of the Athenians. After which, a decree of the senate waspassed, that thanks should be given to their allies, because, thoughlong solicited, they had not, even when in fear of a siege, renouncedtheir fidelity. With regard to sending assistance to them, theyresolved, that an answer should be given as soon as the consuls shouldhave cast lots for the provinces; and when the consul to whose lotMacedonia fell should have proposed to the people, that war should bedeclared against Philip, king of the Macedonians."Book 31,Chapter 6,"The province of Macedonia fell by lot to Publius Sulpicius; and heproposed to the people to declare, ""that they chose and ordered,that on account of the injuries and hostilities committed againstthe allies of the Roman people, war should be proclaimed against kingPhilip, and the Macedonians under his government."" The province ofItaly fell to the lot of the other consul, Aurelius. The praetors thencast lots: to Cneius Sergius Plancus fell the city jurisdiction; toQuintus Fulvius Gillo, Sicily; to Quintus Minucius Rufus, Bruttium;and to Lucius Furius Purpureo, Gaul. At the first meeting of thepeople, the proposal concerning the Macedonian war was rejected byalmost all the tribes. This was done partly spontaneously, as thepeople were wearied by the length and severity of the late war, anddisgusted with toils and dangers; and partly by Quintus Baebius,tribune of the people, who, pursuing the old practice of criminatingthe patricians, charged them with multiplying wars one after another,so that the people could never enjoy peace. This proceeding thepatricians with difficulty brooked, and the tribune was severelyreprehended in the senate; where each severally urged the consulto call a new assembly, for passing the proposal; to rebuke thebackwardness of the people; and to prove to them how much loss anddisgrace the delay of this war would occasion."Book 31,Chapter 7,"The consul, having assembled the people in the field of Mars,before he dismissed the centuries to the vote, required theirattention, and addressed them thus: ""Citizens, you seem to me not tounderstand that the question before you is not whether you choose tohave peace or war: for Philip, having already commenced hostilitieswith a formidable force, both on land and sea, allows you not thatoption. The question is, Whether you must transport your legions toMacedonia, or admit the enemy into Italy? How important the differenceis, if you never experienced it before, you certainly did in the latePunic war. For who entertains a doubt, but if, when the Saguntineswere besieged, and implored our protection, we had assisted them withvigour, as our fathers did the Mamertines, we should have avertedthe whole weight of the war upon Spain; which, by our dilatoryproceedings, we suffered to our extreme loss to fall upon Italy? Nordoes it admit a doubt, that we confined this same Philip in Macedonia,(after he had entered into an engagement with Hannibal by ambassadorsand letters, to cross over into Italy,) by sending Laevinus with afleet to make war aggressively upon him. And what we did at that time,when we had Hannibal to contend with in Italy, do we hesitate to donow, after Hannibal has been expelled Italy, and the Carthaginianssubdued? Suppose that we allow the king to experience the sameinactivity on our part, while he is taking Athens, as we sufferedHannibal to experience while he was taking Saguntum: it will not be inthe fifth month, as Hannibal came from Saguntum, but on the fifth dayafter he sets sail from Corinth, that he will arrive in Italy. Perhapsyou may not consider Philip as equal to Hannibal; or the Macedoniansto the Carthaginians: certainly, however, you will allow him equal toPyrrhus. Equal, do I say? what a vast superiority has the one man overthe other, the one nation over the other! Epirus ever was, and is atthis day, deemed but an inconsiderable accession to the kingdom ofMacedonia. Philip has the entire Peloponnesus under his dominion; evenArgos itself, not more celebrated for its ancient glory than for thedeath of Pyrrhus. Now compare our situation. How much more nourishingwas Italy, how much greater its strength, with so many commanders, somany armies unimpaired, which the Punic war afterwards consumed, whenPyrrhus attacked and shook it, and advanced victorious almost to theRoman capital! and not the Tarentines only, and the inhabitants ofthat tract of Italy which they call the greater Greece, whom you maysuppose to have been led by the similarity of language and name, butthe Lucanian, the Bruttian, and the Samnite revolted from us. Do youbelieve that these would continue quiet and faithful, if Philip shouldcome over to Italy? They subsequently continued faithful, forsooth,during the Punic war! Be assured those states will never fail torevolt from us, except when there is no one to whom they can go over.If you had been annoyed at passing into Africa, you would this dayhave had Hannibal and the Carthaginians to contend with in Italy. LetMacedonia, rather than Italy, be the seat of war. Let the cities andlands of the enemy be wasted with fire and sword. We have alreadyfound by experience, that our arms are more powerful and moresuccessful abroad than at home. Go to the vote with the blessing ofthe gods; and what the senate have voted, do you ratify by your order.This resolution is recommended to you, not only by your consul, buteven by the immortal gods themselves; who, when I offered sacrifice,and prayed that the issue of this war might be happy and prosperous tome and to the senate, to you and the allies and Latin confederates, toour fleets and armies, portended all joyful and prosperous results."""Book 31,Chapter 8,"After this speech of Sulpicius, being sent to give their votes,they declared for the war as he had proposed. On which, in pursuanceof a decree of the senate, a supplication for three days wasproclaimed by the consuls; and prayers were offered to the gods at allthe shrines, that the war which the people had ordered against Philipmight turn out well and happily. The consul Sulpicius inquiring of theheralds, whether they would direct the declaration of the war againstking Philip to be made to himself in person, or whether it would besufficient to publish it in the nearest garrison, within the frontiersof his kingdom, they answered, that they would do rightly whichevercourse they should adopt. The consul received authority from thesenate to send any person whom he thought proper, not being a senator,as ambassador, to denounce war against the king. They then arrangedfor the armies of the consuls and praetors. The consuls were orderedto levy two legions, and to disband the veteran troops. Sulpicius,to whom the management of this new and highly important war had beendecreed, was allowed permission to carry with him as many volunteersas he could procure out of the army which Publius Scipio had broughthome from Africa; but he was not empowered to take with him anyveteran soldier against his will. They ordered that the consul shouldgive to the praetors, Lucius Furius Purpureo and Quintus MinuciusRufus, five thousand of the allies of the Latin confederacy; withwhich forces they should hold, one, the province of Gaul, the other,Bruttium. Quintus Fulvius Gillo was ordered, in like manner, to selectout of the army which Publius Aelius, late consul, had commanded, suchas had been the shortest time in the service, until he also made upfive thousand of the allies and Latin confederates; that this was tobe the protection of the province of Sicily. To Marcus Valerius Falto,who, during the former year, had held the province of Campania, aspraetor, the command was continued for a year; in order that he mightgo over, as propraetor, to Sardinia, and choose out of the army therefive thousand of the allies of the Latin confederacy, who had servedthe fewest campaigns. The consuls were at the same time ordered tolevy two legions for the city, which might be sent wherever occasionsshould require; as there were many states in Italy infected with anattachment to the Carthaginians, which they had formed during the war,and, in consequence, swelling with resentment. The state was to employduring that year six Roman legions."Book 31,Chapter 9,"In the midst of the preparations for war, ambassadors came fromking Ptolemy, who delivered a message; that ""the Athenians hadpetitioned the king for aid against Philip; but that although theywere their common allies, yet the king would not, except with thesanction of the Roman people, send either fleet or army into Greece,for the purpose of defending or attacking any person. That he wouldeither remain quiet in his kingdom, if the Romans were at leisure toprotect their allies; or, if more agreeable to them to be at rest,would himself send such aid as might easily secure Athens againstPhilip."" Thanks were returned to the king by the senate, and thisanswer: that ""it was the intention of the Roman people to protecttheir allies; that if they should have occasion for any assistancetowards carrying on the war, they would acquaint the king; and thatthey were fully sensible, that the resources of his kingdom were thesure and faithful support of their own state."" Presents were then,by order of the senate, sent to the ambassadors, of five thousand_asses_[1] to each. While the consuls were engaged in the levy,and preparing what was necessary for the war, the people, prone toreligious observances, especially at the beginning of new wars, aftersupplications had been already performed, and prayers offered up atall the shrines, lest any thing should be omitted that had ever beenpractised, ordered, that the consul who was to have the province ofMacedonia should vow games and a present to Jove. Licinius, the chiefpontiff, occasioned some delay to this public vow, alleging, that ""itought not to be fulfilled from promiscuous funds. For as the sum tobe named should not be applied to the uses of the war, it should beimmediately set apart, and not to be intermixed with other money; andthat, unless this were done, the vow could not be properly performed.""Although the objection and the author of it were influential, yet theconsul was ordered to consult the college of pontiffs, whether avow could be undertaken at an indeterminate expense? The pontiffsdetermined, that it could; and that it would be even more in order todo it in that way. The consul, therefore, repeating after the chiefpontiff, made the vow in the same words in which those made for fiveyears of safety used to be expressed; only that he engaged to performthe games, and make the offerings, at such expense as the senateshould direct by their vote, at the time when the vow was performed.Before this, the great games so often vowed, were constantly rated ata certain expense: these first at an unspecified amount."Book 31,Chapter 10,"While every one's attention was turned to the Macedonian war, andat a time when people apprehended nothing less, a sudden account wasbrought of an inroad of the Gauls. The Insubrians, Caenomanians,and Boians, having been joined by the Salyans, Ilvatians, and otherLigurian states, and putting themselves under the command of Hamilcar,a Carthaginian, who, having been in the army of Hasdrubal, hadremained in those parts, had fallen upon Placentia; and, afterplundering the city, and, in their rage, burning a great part of it,leaving scarcely two thousand men among the flames and ruins, passedthe Po, and advanced to plunder Cremona. The news of the calamitywhich had fallen on a city in their neighbourhood, having reachedthither, the inhabitants had time to shut their gates, and placeguards on the walls, that they might, at least, be besieged beforethey were taken, and send messengers to the Roman praetor. LuciusFurius Purpureo, who had then the command of the province, had, inpursuance of the decree of the senate, disbanded the army, exceptingfive thousand of the allies and Latin confederacy; and had remained,with these troops, in the nearest district of the province aboutAriminum. He immediately informed the senate, by letter, in whatconfusion the province was. That, ""of the two colonies which hadescaped in the dreadful storm of the Punic war, one was taken andsacked by the present enemy, and the other besieged. Nor was hisarmy capable of affording sufficient protection to the distressedcolonists, unless he chose to expose five thousand allies to beslaughtered by forty thousand invaders (for so many there were inarms); and by such a loss, on his side, to augment the courage of theenemy, already elated on having destroyed one Roman colony."""Book 31,Chapter 11,"This letter having been read they decreed, that the consulAurelius should order the army which he had appointed to assemble on acertain day in Etruria, to attend him on the same day at Ariminum; andshould either go in person, if the public business would permit,to suppress the tumult of the Gauls, or write to the praetor LuciusFurius, that, as soon as the legions from Etruria came to him, heshould send five thousand of the allies to guard that place in themean time, and should himself proceed to relieve the colony fromthe siege. They also determined, that ambassadors should be sentto Carthage, and also into Numidia, to Masinissa: to Carthage, toannounce that ""their countryman, Hamilcar, having been left in Gaul,(either with a part of the army formerly commanded by Hasdrubal, orwith that of Mago--they did not with certainty know which,) was wagingwar, contrary to the treaty. That he had excited the armies of theGauls and Ligurians to arms against the Roman people. That, if theywished for peace, they must recall him, and give him up to the Romanpeople."" They were ordered at the same time to tell them, that ""allthe deserters had not been sent back; that a great part of them weresaid to appear openly in Carthage, who ought to be sought after, andsurrendered according to the treaty."" Such was the message to theCarthaginians. To Masinissa they were charged with congratulations, onhis ""having not only recovered the kingdom of his father, but enlargedit by the acquisition of the most flourishing parts of Syphax'sterritories."" They were ordered also to acquaint him, that ""a warhad been undertaken against Philip, because he had given aid to theCarthaginians, while, by the injuries which he offered to the alliesof the Roman people, he had obliged them to send fleets and armiesinto Greece, while Italy was blazing with war; and that by thus makingthem separate their forces, had been the principal cause of theirbeing so late passing over into Africa; and to request him to sendto that war supplies of Numidian horsemen."" Ample presents were giventhem to be carried to the king; vases of gold and silver, a purplerobe, and a tunic adorned with palms of purple, an ivory sceptre,and a robe of state, with a curule chair. They were also directed toassure him, that if he deemed any thing further requisite to confirmand enlarge his kingdom, the Roman people, in return for his goodservices, would exert their utmost zeal to effect it. At this time,too, ambassadors from Vermina, son of Syphax, came to the senateapologizing for his mistaken conduct, on account of his youth and wantof judgment, and throwing all the blame on the deceitful policy of theCarthaginians: adding, ""that as Masinissa had from an enemy become afriend to the Romans, so Vermina would also use his best endeavoursthat he should not be outdone in offices of friendship to the Romanpeople either by Masinissa, or by any other; and requesting that hemight receive from the senate the title of king, friend, and ally.""The answer given to these ambassadors was, that ""not only his fatherSyphax, from a friend and ally, had on a sudden, without any reason,become an enemy to the Roman people, but that he himself had madehis first essay of manhood in bearing arms against them. He must,therefore, sue to the Roman people for peace, before he could expectto be acknowledged king, ally, and friend; that it was the practiceof that people to bestow the honour of such title, in return for greatservices performed by kings towards them; that the Roman ambassadorswould soon be in Africa, to whom the senate would give instructions toregulate conditions of peace with Vermina, if he would leave the termsof it entirely to the will of the Roman people; and that, if he wishedthat any thing should be added, left out, or altered, he must make asecond application to the senate."" The ambassadors sent to Africaon those affairs, were Caius Terentius Varro, Publius Lucretius, andCneius Octavius, each of whom had a quinquereme assigned him."Book 31,Chapter 12,"A letter was then read in the senate, from Quintus Minucius, thepraetor, who held the province of Bruttium, that ""the money had beenprivately carried off by night out of the treasury of Proserpineat Locri; and that there were no traces to those to whom the chargeapplied."" The senate was highly incensed at finding that the practiceof sacrilege continued, and that even the fate of Pleminius, anexample so recent and so conspicuous both of the guilt and of thepunishment, did not deter men from it. They ordered the consul, CneiusAurelius, to signify to the praetor in Bruttium, that ""it was thepleasure of the senate, that an inquiry be made concerning the robberyof the treasury, according to the method used by Marcus Pomponius,praetor, three years before; that the money which could be discoveredshould be restored, that what was not found should be made up, andthat if he thought proper, atonements should be made for the purposeof expiating the violation of the temple, in the manner formerlyprescribed by the pontiffs."" At the same time, also, prodigies wereannounced as having happened in many places. It was said, that inLucania the sky had been seen in a blaze; that at Privernum, in clearweather, the sun had been of a red colour during a whole day; that atLanuvium, in the temple of Juno Sospita, a very loud noise had beenheard in the night. Besides, monstrous births of animals were relatedto have occurred in many places: in the country of the Sabines, aninfant was born whose sex was doubtful; and another was found, sixteenyears old, of doubtful sex. At Frusino a lamb was born with a swine'shead; at Sinuessa, a pig with a human head; and in Lucania, in theland belonging to the state, a foal with five feet. All these wereconsidered as horrid and abominable, and as if nature were straying tostrange productions. Above all, the people were particularly shockedat the hermaphrodites, which were ordered to be immediately throwninto the sea, as had been lately done with a production of the samemonstrous kind, in the consulate of Caius Claudius and Marcus Livius.Notwithstanding they ordered the decemvirs to inspect the books inregard of that prodigy; and the decemvirs, from the books, directedthe same religious ceremonies which had been performed on an occasionof the same kind. They ordered, besides, a hymn to be sung through thecity by thrice nine virgins, and an offering to be made to imperialJuno. The consul, Caius Aurelius, took care that all these matterswere performed according to the direction of the decemvirs. The hymnwas composed by Publius Licinius Tegula, as a similar one had been, inthe memory of their fathers, by Livius."Book 31,Chapter 13,"All religious scruples were fully removed by expiations; at Locri,too, the affair of the sacrilege had been thoroughly investigated byQuintus Minucius, and the money replaced in the treasury out of theeffects of the guilty. When the consuls wished to set out to theirprovinces, a number of private persons, to whom the third paymentbecame due that year, of the money which they had lent to the publicin the consulate of Marcus Valerius and Marcus Claudius, applied tothe senate. The consuls, however, declared that the treasury beingscarcely sufficient for the exigencies of a new war, in which a greatfleet and great armies must be employed, there were no means of payingthem at present. The senate could not stand against them when theycomplained, that ""if the state intended to use, for the purpose of theMacedonian war, the money which had been lent for the Punic war, asone war constantly arose after another, what would be the issue,but that, in return for their generosity, their property would beconfiscated as for some crime?"" The demands of the private creditorsbeing equitable, and the state being in no capacity of dischargingthe debt, they decreed a middle course between equity and convenience;resolving that ""whereas many of them mentioned that lands werefrequently exposed to sale, and that they themselves wished to becomepurchasers, they should, therefore, have liberty to purchase anybelonging to the public, and which lay within fifty miles of the city.That the consuls should make a valuation of these, and impose on eachacre one _as_, as an acknowledgment that the land was the property ofthe public, in order that, when the people should become able to pay,if any one chose rather to have the money than the land, he mightrestore it."" The private creditors accepted the terms with joy; andthat land was called Trientius and Tabulius, because it was given inlieu of the third part of their money."Book 31,Chapter 14,"Publius Sulpicius, after making his vows in the Capitol, setout robed from the city with his lictors, and arrived at Brundusium;where, having formed into legions the veteran soldiers of the Africanarmy who were willing to follow him, and chosen his ships out ofthe fleet of the late consul, Cornelius, he crossed and arrived inMacedonia the day after he had set sail from Brundusium. There he wasmet by ambassadors from the Athenians, entreating him to relieve themfrom the siege. Immediately, Caius Claudius Centho was despatched toAthens, with twenty ships of war, and a thousand of land forces. Forit was not the king himself who carried on the siege of Athens; hewas at that time besieging Abydus, after having tried his strengthin naval contests against Attalus, and against the Rhodians,without success in either engagement. But, besides the naturalpresumptuousness of his temper, he acquired confidence from a treatywhich he had formed with Antiochus, king of Syria, in which they haddivided the wealth of Egypt between them; on which, on hearing ofthe death of Ptolemy, they were both intent. The Athenians now hadentangled themselves in a war with Philip on too trifling an occasion,and at a time when they retained nothing of their former condition buttheir pride. During the celebration of the mysteries, two young men ofAcarnania, who were not initiated, unapprized of its being an offenceagainst religion, entered the temple of Ceres along with the rest ofthe crowd: their discourse readily betrayed them, by their asking someabsurd questions; whereupon, being carried before the presidents ofthe temple, although it was evident that they went in through mistake,yet they were put to death, as if for a heinous crime. The Acarnaniannation made complaint to Philip of this barbarous and hostile act, andprevailed on him to grant them some aid of Macedonian soldiers, andto allow them to make war on the Athenians. At first this army, afterravaging the lands of Attica with fire and sword, retired toAcarnania with booty of all kinds. This was the first provocation tohostilities. The Athenians afterwards, on their side, entered into aregular war, and proclaimed it by order of the state. For king Attalusand the Rhodians, having come to Aegina in pursuit of Philip, whowas retiring to Macedonia, the king crossed over to Piraeus, for thepurpose of renewing and confirming his alliance with the Athenians. Onentering the city, the whole inhabitants received him, pouring forthwith their wives and children to meet him; the priests, with theiremblems of religion; and in a manner the gods themselves, called forthfrom their abodes."Book 31,Chapter 15,"Immediately the people were summoned to an assembly, that theking might treat with them in person on such subjects as he chose; butafterwards it was judged more suitable to his dignity to explain hissentiments in writing, than, being present, to be forced to blush,either at the recital of his favours to the state, or at theimmoderate applause of the multitude, which would overwhelm hismodesty with acclamations and other signs of approbation. In theletter which he sent, and which was read to the assembly, wascontained first, a recapitulation of his acts of kindness to thestate, as his ally; then, of the actions which he had performedagainst Philip; and lastly, an exhortation to ""enter immediately onthe war; while they had himself, the Rhodians, and the Romans also toassist them;"" not omitting to warn them that ""if they were backwardnow, they would hereafter wish in vain for the opportunity whichthey neglected."" They then gave audience to the ambassadors of theRhodians, to whom they were under a recent obligation for havingretaken, and sent home, four of their ships of war, which had beenlately seized by the Macedonians. War was determined upon againstPhilip with universal consent. Unbounded honours were conferred onking Attalus, and then on the Rhodians. At that time, mention was madeof adding a tribe, which they were to call Attalus, to the ten ancienttribes; the Rhodian state was presented with a golden crown, as anacknowledgment of its bravery, and the freedom of the city was givento the inhabitants, in like manner as the Rhodians had formerly givenit to the Athenians. After this, king Attalus returned to his fleet atAegina. From Aegina, the Rhodians sailed to Cia, and thence toRhodes, through the islands, all of which they brought to join inthe alliance, except Andros, Paros, and Cythnus, which were held byMacedonian garrisons. Attalus, having sent messengers to Aetolia, andexpecting ambassadors from thence, was detained at Aegina for sometime in a state of inaction; failing also in his endeavours to excitethe Aetolians to arms, for they were rejoiced at having made peacewith Philip on any terms. Had Attalus and the Rhodians pressed Philipvigorously, they might have acquired the illustrious title of thedeliverers of Greece, but by suffering him to pass over again intoHellespontus, and to strengthen himself by seizing the advantageousposts in Greece, they increased the difficulties of the war, andyielded up to the Romans the glory of having conducted and finishedit."Book 31,Chapter 16,"Philip acted with a spirit more becoming a king; for, though hehad found himself unequal to the forces of Attalus and the Rhodians,yet he was not dismayed, even by the Roman war with which he wasthreatened. Sending Philocles, one of his generals, with two thousandfoot and two hundred horse, to ravage the lands of the Athenians, hegave the command of his fleet to Heraclides, to make for Maronea,and marched thither himself by land, with two thousand foot lightlyequipped, and two hundred horse. Maronea he took at the first assault;and afterwards, with a good deal of trouble, got possession of Aenus,which was at last betrayed to him by Ganymede, the lieutenant ofPtolemy. He then seized on other forts, Cypselus, Doriscos, andSerrheus; and, advancing from thence to the Chersonesus, receivedElaeus and Alopeconnesus, which were surrendered by the inhabitants.Callipolis also, and Madytos, were given up to him, with severalforts of but little consequence. The people of Abydus shut their gatesagainst him, not admitting the ambassadors. This siege detained Philipa long time; and it might have been relieved, had not Attalus and theRhodians been dilatory. The king sent only three hundred men for agarrison, and the Rhodians one quadrireme from their fleet, althoughit was lying idle at Tenedos: and afterwards, when the besieged couldwith difficulty hold out any longer, Attalus, going over in person,did nothing more than show them some hope of relief being near, givingno assistance to these his allies either by land or sea."Book 31,Chapter 17,"At first the people of Abydus, by means of engines placed alongthe walls, not only prevented the approaches by land, but annoyed theenemy's ships in their station. Afterwards a part of the wall beingthrown down, and the assailants having penetrated by mines to an innerwall, which had been hastily raised to oppose their entrance, theysent ambassadors to the king about the conditions of the surrenderof the city. They demanded permission to send away the Rhodianquadrireme, with the crew, and the troops of Attalus in the garrison;and that they themselves might depart from the city, each withone suit of apparel. When Philip's answer afforded no hopes ofaccommodation, unless they surrendered at discretion, this repudiationof their embassy so exasperated them, at once through indignation anddespair, that, seized with the same kind of fury which had possessedthe Saguntines, they ordered all the matrons to be shut up in thetemple of Diana, and the free-born youths and virgins, and even theinfants with their nurses, in the place of exercise; the gold andsilver to be carried into the forum; their valuable garments to be puton board the Rhodian ship, and another from Cyzicum, which lay inthe harbour; the priests and victims to be brought, and altars to beerected in the midst. There they appointed a select number, who, assoon as they should see the army of their friends cut off in defendingthe breach, were instantly to slay their wives and children; to throwinto the sea the gold, silver, and apparel that was on board theships, and to set fire to the buildings, public and private: and tothe performance of this deed they were bound by an oath, the priestsrepeating before them the verses of execration. Those who were of anage capable of fighting then swore that they would not leave theirranks alive unless victorious. These, regardful of the gods, (by whomthey had sworn,) maintained their ground with such obstinacy, thatalthough the night would soon have put a stop to the fight, yet theking, terrified by their fury, first desisted from the fight. Thechief inhabitants, to whom the more shocking part of the plan had beengiven in charge, seeing that few survived the battle, and that thesewere exhausted by fatigue and wounds, sent the priests (having theirheads bound with the fillets of suppliants) at the dawn of the nextday to surrender the city to Philip."Book 31,Chapter 18,"Before the surrender, one of the Roman ambassadors, who had beensent to Alexandria, Marcus Aemilius, being the youngest of them, onthe joint resolution of the three, on hearing of the present siege,came to Philip, and complained of his having made war on Attalus andthe Rhodians; and particularly that he was then besieging Abydus; andon Philip's saying that he had been forced into the war by Attalus andthe Rhodians commencing hostilities against him,--""Did the people ofAbydus, too,"" said he, ""commence hostilities against you?"" To him, whowas unaccustomed to hear truth, this language seemed too arrogant tobe used to a king, and he answered,--""Your youth, the beauty of yourform, and, above all, the name of Roman, render you too presumptuous.However, my first desire is, that you would observe the treaties, andcontinue in peace with me; but if you begin an attack, I am, on mypart, determined to prove that the kingdom and name of the Macedoniansis not less formidable in war than that of the Romans."" Havingdismissed the ambassador in this manner, Philip got possession of thegold and silver which had been thrown together in a heap, but lost hisbooty with respect to prisoners: for such violent frenzy had seizedthe multitude, that, on a sudden, taking up a persuasion that thosewho had fallen in the battle had been treacherously sacrificed, andupbraiding one another with perjury, especially the priests, who wouldsurrender alive to the enemy those persons whom they themselves haddevoted, they all at once ran different ways to put their wives andchildren to death; and then they put an end to their own livesby every possible method. The king, astonished at their madness,restrained the violence of his soldiers, and said, ""that he wouldallow the people of Abydus three days to die in;"" and, during thisspace, the vanquished perpetrated more deeds of cruelty on themselvesthan the enraged conquerors would have committed; nor did any one ofthem come into his hands alive, except such as chains, or some otherinsuperable restraint, forbade to die. Philip, leaving a garrison inAbydus, returned to his kingdom; and, just when he had been encouragedby the destruction of the people of Abydus to proceed in the waragainst Rome, as Hannibal had been by the destruction of Saguntum, hewas met by couriers, with intelligence that the consul was already inEpirus, and had drawn his land forces to Apollonia, and his fleet toCorcyra, into winter quarters."Book 31,Chapter 19,"In the mean time, the ambassadors who had been sent into Africa,on the affair of Hamilcar, the leader of the Gallic army, receivedfrom the Carthaginians this answer: that ""it was not in their powerto do more than to inflict on him the punishment of exile, and toconfiscate his effects; that they had delivered up all the desertersand fugitives, whom, on a diligent inquiry, they had been able todiscover, and would send ambassadors to Rome, to satisfy the senate onthat head."" They sent two hundred thousand measures of wheat toRome, and the same quantity to the army in Macedonia. From thencethe ambassadors proceeded into Numidia, to the king; deliveredto Masinissa the presents and the message according to theirinstructions, and out of two thousand Numidian horsemen, which heoffered, accepted one thousand. Masinissa superintended in personthe embarkation of these, and sent them, with two hundred thousandmeasures of wheat, and the same quantity of barley, into Macedonia.Their third commission was with Vermina. He advanced to meet them asfar as the utmost limits of his kingdom, and left it to themselves toprescribe such conditions of peace as they thought proper, declaring,that ""he should consider any peace with the Roman people as just andadvantageous."" The terms were then settled, and he was ordered to sendambassadors to Rome to procure a ratification of the treaty."Book 31,Chapter 20,"About the same time, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, proconsul, camehome from Spain; and having laid before the senate an account ofhis brave and successful conduct, during the course of many years,demanded that he might be allowed to enter the city in triumph. Thesenate gave their opinion that ""his services were, indeed, deservingof a triumph; but that they had no precedent left them by theirancestors of any person enjoying a triumph, who had not performed theservice either of dictator, consul, or praetor; that he had heldthe province of Spain in quality of proconsul, and not of consul, orpraetor."" They determined, however, that he might enter the city inovation. Against this, Tiberius Sempronius Longus, tribune of thepeople, protested, alleging, that such proceedings would be no more inaccordance with the custom of their ancestors, or with any precedent,than the other; but, overcome at length by the unanimous desire ofthe senate, the tribune withdrew his opposition, and Lucius Lentulusentered the city in ovation. He carried to the treasury forty-fourthousand pounds weight of silver, and two thousand four hundred poundsweight of gold. To each of the soldiers he distributed, of the spoil,one hundred and twenty _asses_.[1]"Book 31,Chapter 21,"The consular army had, by this time, been conducted from Arretiumto Ariminum, and the five thousand Latin confederates had crossed fromGaul into Etruria. Lucius Furius, therefore, advanced from Ariminum,by forced marches, against the Gauls, who were then besieging Cremona,and pitched his camp at the distance of one mile and a half from theenemy. Furius had an opportunity of performing a splendid exploit,had he, without halting, led his troops directly to attack their camp;scattered hither and thither, they were wandering through the country;and the guard, which they had left, was not sufficiently strong; buthe was apprehensive that his men were too much fatigued by their hastymarch. The Gauls, recalled from the fields by the shouts of theirparty, returned to the camp without seizing the booty within theirreach, and, next day, marched out to offer battle. The Roman did notdecline the combat, but had scarcely time to draw up his forces, sorapidly did the enemy advance to the fight. The right brigade (for hehad the troops of the allies divided into brigades) was placed in thefirst line, the two Roman legions in reserve. Marcus Furius was at thehead of the right brigade, Marcus Caecilius of the legions, and LuciusValerius Flaccus of the cavalry; these were all lieutenant-generals.Two other lieutenant-generals, Cneius Laetorius and Publius Titinnius,the praetor kept near himself, that, with their assistance, he mightobserve and take proper measures against all sudden attempts of theenemy. At first, the Gauls, bending their whole force to one point,were in hopes of being able to overwhelm, and trample under foot,the right brigade, which was in the van; but not succeeding, theyendeavoured to turn round the flanks, and to surround their enemy'sline, which, considering the multitude of their forces, and the smallnumber of the others, seemed easy to be done. On observing this, thepraetor, in order to extend his own line, brought up the two legionsfrom the reserve, and placed them on the right and left of the brigadewhich was engaged in the van; vowing a temple to Jupiter, if he shouldrout the enemy on that day. To Lucius Valerius he gave orders, to makethe horsemen of the two legions on one flank, and the cavalry of theallies on the other, charge the wings of the enemy, and not sufferthem to come round to his rear. At the same time, observing that thecentre of the line of the Gauls was weakened, from having extended thewings, he directed his men to make an attack there in close order, andto break through their ranks. The wings were routed by the cavalry,and, at the same time, the centre by the foot; and suddenly, beingworsted in all parts with great slaughter, the Gauls turned theirbacks, and fled to their camp in hurry and confusion. The cavalrypursued them as they fled; and the legions, coming up in a short timeafter, assaulted the camp, from whence there did not escape so manyas six thousand men. There were slain and taken above thirty-fivethousand, with seventy standards, and above two hundred Gallic waggonsladen with much booty. Hamilcar, the Carthaginian general, fellin that battle, and three distinguished generals of the Gauls. Theprisoners taken at Placentia, to the number of two thousand freemen,were restored to the colony."Book 31,Chapter 22,"This was an important victory, and caused great joy at Rome. Onreceipt of the praetor's letter, a supplication for three days wasdecreed. In that battle, there fell of the Romans and allies twothousand, most of them in the right brigade, against which, in thefirst onset, the most violent efforts of the enemy had been directed.Although the praetor had brought the war almost to a conclusion, yetthe consul, Cneius Aurelius, having finished the business which wasnecessary to be done at Rome, set out for Gaul, and received thevictorious army from the praetor. The other consul, arriving inhis province towards the end of autumn, passed the winter in theneighbourhood of Apollonia. Caius Claudius, and the Roman triremeswhich had been sent to Athens from the fleet that was laid up atCorcyra, as was mentioned above, arriving at Piraeeus, greatly revivedthe hopes of their allies, who were beginning to give way to despair.For not only did those inroads by land cease, which used to bemade from Corinth through Megara, but the ships of the pirates fromChalcis, who had been accustomed to infest both the Athenian sea andcoast, were afraid not only to venture round the promontory of Sunium,but even to trust themselves out of the straits of the Euripus. Inaddition to these came three quadriremes from Rhodes, the Athenianshaving three open ships, which they had equipped for the protection oftheir lands on the coast. While Claudius thought, that if he were ablewith his fleet to give security to the Athenians it was as much ascould be expected at present, a fortunate opportunity was thrown inhis way of accomplishing a much more important enterprise."Book 31,Chapter 23,"Some exiles driven from Chalcis, by ill treatment received fromthe king's party, brought intelligence, that the place might be takenwithout even a contest; for that both the Macedonians, being underno immediate apprehension from an enemy, were straying idly about thecountry; and that the townsmen, depending on the Macedonian garrison,neglected the guard of the city. Claudius, on this authority, set outand though he arrived at Sunium early enough to have sailed forwardto the entrance of the strait of Euboea, yet fearing that, on doublingthe promontory, he might be descried by the enemy, he lay by withthe fleet until night. As soon as it grew dark he began to move, and,favoured by a calm, arrived at Chalcis a little before day; and then,approaching the city, on a side where it was thinly inhabited, witha small party of soldiers, and by means of scaling ladders, he gotpossession of the nearest tower, and the wall on each side; the guardsbeing asleep in some places, and in others no one being on the watch.Thence they advanced to the more populous parts of the town, andhaving slain the sentinels, and broke open a gate, they gave anentrance to the main body of the troops. These immediately spreadthemselves throughout the whole city, and increased the tumult bysetting fire to the buildings round the forum, by which means both thegranaries belonging to the king, and his armoury, with a vast store ofmachines and engines, were reduced to ashes. Then commenced a generalslaughter of those who fled, as well as of those who made resistance;and after having either put to the sword or driven out every one whowas of an age fit to bear arms, (Sopater also, the Acarnanian, whocommanded the garrison, being slain,) they first collected all thespoils in the forum, and then carried it on board the ships. Theprison, too, was forced open by the Rhodians, and those prisonerswhom Philip had shut up there, as in the safest custody, were set atliberty. They next pulled down and mutilated the statues of the king;and then, on a signal being given for a retreat, re-embarked andreturned to Piraeeus, from whence they had set out. If there hadbeen so large a force of Roman soldiers that Chalcis might have beenretained and the protection of Athens not neglected, Chalcis andEuripus might have been taken from the king;--a most importantadvantage at the commencement of the war. For as the pass ofThermopylae is the principal barrier of Greece by land, so is thestrait of the Euripus by sea."Book 31,Chapter 24,"Philip was then at Demetrias, and as soon as the news arrivedthere of the calamity which had befallen the city of his allies,although it was too late to carry assistance to those who werealready ruined, yet anxious to accomplish what was next to assistance,revenge, he set out instantly with five thousand foot lightlyequipped, and three hundred horse. With a speed almost equal to thatof racing, he hastened to Chalcis, not doubting but that he should beable to surprise the Romans. Being disappointed in this expectation,and having arrived, with no other result than a melancholy view ofthe smoking ruins of that friendly city, (so few being left, thatthey were scarcely sufficient to bury those who had fallen in theconflict,) with the same rapid haste which he had used in coming, hecrossed the Euripus by the bridge, and led his troops through Boeotiato Athens, in hopes that a similar issue would correspond to a similarattempt. And it would have corresponded, had not a scout, (one ofthose whom the Greeks call day-runners,[1] because they run througha journey of great length in one day,) descrying from his post ofobservation the king's army in its march, set out at midnightand arrived before them at Athens. The same sleep, and the samenegligence, prevailed there which had proved the ruin of Chalcis afew days before. Roused, however, by the alarming intelligence, thepraetor of the Athenians, and Dioxippus, commander of a cohort ofmercenary auxiliaries, called the soldiers together in the forum,and ordered the trumpets to sound an alarm from the citadel, that allmight be informed of the approach of the enemy. On which the peopleran from all quarters to the gates, and afterwards to the walls. In afew hours after, and still some time before day, Philip approached thecity, and observing a great number of lights, and hearing the noise ofthe men hurrying to and fro, as usual on such an alarm, he halted histroops, and ordered them to sit down and take some rest; resolving touse open force, since his stratagem had not succeeded. Accordinglyhe advanced on the side of Dipylos. This gate, being situated in theprincipal approach of the city, is somewhat larger and wider thanthe rest. Both within and without the streets are wide, so that thetownsmen could form their troops from the forum to the gate, while onthe outside a road of about a mile in length, leading to the schoolof the academy, afforded open room to the foot and horse of the enemy.The Athenians, who had formed their troops within the gate, marchedout with Attalus's garrison, and the cohort of Dioxippus, along thatroad. Which, when Philip observed, thinking that he had the enemy inhis power, and was now about to sate himself with their long wishedfor destruction, (being more incensed against them than any of theGrecian states,) he exhorted his men to keep their eyes on him duringthe fight, and to take notice, that wherever the king was, therethe standards and the army ought to be. He then spurred on his horseagainst the enemy, animated not only with resentment, but with adesire of gaining honour, for he reckoned it a glorious thing to bebeheld fighting from the walls, which were filled with an immensemultitude, for the purpose of witnessing the engagement. Advancingfar before the line, and with a small body of horse, rushing into themidst of the enemy, he inspired his men with great ardour, and theAthenians equally with terror. Having wounded many with his own hand,both in close fight and with missive weapons, and driven them backwithin the gate, he still pursued them closely; and having madegreater slaughter among them while embarrassed in the narrow pass,rash as the attempt was, he yet had an unmolested retreat, becausethose who were in the towers withheld their weapons lest they shouldhit their friends, who were mingled in confusion among their enemies.The Athenians, after this, confining their troops within the walls,Philip sounded a retreat, and pitched his camp at Cynosarges, a templeof Hercules, and a school surrounded by a grove. But Cynosarges, andLycaeum, and whatever was sacred or pleasant in the neighbourhood ofthe city, he burned to the ground, and levelled not only the houses,but sepulchres, nor was any thing either in divine or human possessionpreserved amidst the violence of his rage."Book 31,Chapter 25,"Next day, the gates having at first been shut, and afterwardssuddenly thrown open, in consequence of a body of Attalus's troopsfrom Aegina, and the Romans from Piraeeus, having entered the city,the king removed his camp to the distance of about three miles. Fromthence he proceeded to Eleusis, in hopes of surprising the temple, anda fort which overlooks and surrounds it; but, finding that the watcheshad not been neglected, and that the fleet was coming from Piraeeus tosupport them, he laid aside the design, and led his troops, first toMegara, and then to Corinth; where, on hearing that the council of theAchaeans was then sitting at Argos, he went and joined the assembly,unexpected by the Achaeans. They were at the time consulting about awar against Nabis, tyrant of the Lacedaemonians; who, on the commandbeing transferred from Philopoemen to Cycliades, a general by nomeans his equal, perceiving that the confederates of the Achaeans werefalling off, had renewed the war, was ravaging the territories of hisneighbours, and had become formidable even to the cities. While theywere deliberating what number of men should be raised out of each ofthe states to oppose this enemy, Philip promised that he would relievethem of that care, as far as concerned Nabis and the Lacedaemonians;and that he would not only secure the lands of their allies fromdevastation, but transfer the whole terror of the war on Laconiaitself, by leading his army thither instantly. This discourse beingreceived with general approbation, he added,--""It is but reasonable,however, that while I am employed in protecting your property by myarms, my own should not be deprived of protection; therefore, if youthink proper, provide such a number of troops as will be sufficient tosecure Orcus, Chalcis, and Corinth; that my affairs being in a stateof safety behind me, I may without anxiety make war on Nabis and theLacedaemonians."" The Achaeans were not ignorant of the tendency ofthis so kind promise, and of his proffered assistance against theLacedaemonians; that his purpose was to draw the Achaean youth out ofPeloponnesus as hostages, in order to implicate the nation in a warwith the Romans. Cycliades, the Achaean praetor, thinking that it wasirrelevant to develope the matter by argument, said nothing more thanthat it was not allowable, according to the laws of the Achaeans, totake any matters into consideration except those on which they hadbeen called together: and the decree for levying an army against Nabisbeing passed, he dismissed the assembly, after having presided in itwith much resolution and public spirit, and until that day having beenreckoned among the partisans of the king. Philip, disappointed in ahigh expectation, after having collected a few voluntary soldiers,returned to Corinth, and from thence into the territories of Athens."Book 31,Chapter 26,"In those days in which Philip was in Achaia, Philocles, one of theking's generals, marching from Euboea with two thousand Thracians andMacedonians, in order to lay waste the territories of the Athenians,crossed the forest of Cithaeron opposite to Eleusis. Despatchinghalf of his troops, make depredations in all parts of the country, hehimself lay concealed with the remainder in a place convenient for anambush; in order that, if any attack should be made from the fort atEleusis on his men employed in plundering, he might suddenly fall uponthe enemy unawares, and while they were in disorder. His stratagemdid not escape discovery: wherefore calling back the soldiers, who hadgone different ways in pursuit of booty, and drawing them up in order,he advanced to assault the fort at Eleusis; but being repulsed fromthence with many wounds, he formed a junction with Philip on hisreturn from Achaia. The storming of this fort was also attempted bythe king in person: but the Roman ships coming from Piraeeus, and abody of forces thrown into the fort, compelled him to relinquish thedesign. On this the king, dividing his army, sent Philocles with onepart to Athens, and went himself with the other to Piraeeus; that,while his general, by advancing to the walls and threatening anassault, might keep the Athenians within the city, he might be ableto make himself master of the harbour, when left with only a slightgarrison. But he found the attack of Piraeeus no less difficult thanthat of Eleusis, the same persons for the most part acting in itsdefence. He therefore hastily led his troops to Athens, and beingrepulsed by a sudden sally of both foot and horse, who engaged him inthe narrow ground, enclosed by the half-ruined wall, which, with twoarms, joins Piraeus to Athens, he desisted from the assault of thecity, and, dividing his forces again with Philocles, set out tocomplete the devastation of the country. As, in his former ravages,he had employed himself in levelling the sepulchres round the city, sonow, not to leave any thing unviolated, he ordered the temples ofthe gods, of which they had one consecrated in every village, to bedemolished and burned. The country of Attica afforded ample matterfor the exercise of this barbarous rage: being highly embellished withworks of that kind, having plenty of indigenous marble, and aboundingwith artists of exquisite ingenuity. Nor was he satisfied with merelydestroying the temples themselves, and overthrowing the images, buthe ordered even the stones to be broken, lest, remaining whole, theyshould give stateliness to the ruins; and then, his rage not beingsatiated, but no object remaining on which it could be exercised, heretired from the country of the enemy into Boeotia, without havingperformed in Greece any thing else worth mention."Book 31,Chapter 27,"The consul, Sulpicius, who was at that time encamped; on theriver Apsus, between Apollonia and Dyrrachium, having ordered LuciusApustius, lieutenant-general, thither, sent him with part of theforces to lay waste the enemy's territory. Apustius, after ravagingthe frontiers of Macedonia, and having, at the first assault, takenthe forts of Corragos, Gerrunios, and Orgessos, came to Antipatria, acity situated in a narrow gorge; where, at first inviting theleading men to a conference, he endeavoured to entice them to committhemselves to the good faith of the Romans; but finding that fromconfidence in the size, fortifications, and situation of their city,they paid no regard to his discourse, he attacked the place by forceof arms, and took it by assault: then, putting all the young men todeath, and giving up the entire spoil to his soldiers, he razed thewalls and burned the city. This proceeding spread such terror, thatCodrion, a strong and well-fortified town, surrendered to the Romanswithout a struggle. Leaving a garrison there, he took Ilion by force,a name better known than the town, on account of that of the same namein Asia. As the lieutenant-general was returning to the consul witha great quantity of spoil, Athenagoras, one of the king's generals,falling on his extreme rear, in its passage over a river, threw thehindmost into disorder. On hearing the shouting and tumult, Apustiusrode back in full speed, ordered the troops to face about, and drewthem up in order, arranging the baggage in the centre. The king'stroops could not support the onset of the Roman soldiers, many of themwere slain, and more made prisoners. The lieutenant-general, havingbrought back the army without loss to the consul, was despatchedimmediately to the fleet."Book 31,Chapter 28,"The war commencing thus brilliantly with this successfulexpedition, several petty kings and princes, neighbours of theMacedonians, came to the Roman camp: Pleuratus, son of Scerdilaedus,and Amynander, king of the Athamanians; and from the Dardanians, Bato,son of Longarus. This Longarus had, in his own quarrel, supported awar against Demetrius, father of Philip. To their offers of aid,the consul answered, that he would make use of the assistance of theDardanians, and of Pleuratus, when he should lead his troops intoMacedonia. To Amynander he allotted the part of exciting the Aetoliansto war. To the ambassadors of Attalus, (for they also had come at thesame time,) he gave directions that the king should wait at Aegina,where he wintered, for the arrival of the Roman fleet; and when joinedby that, he should, as before, harass Philip with attacks by sea. Tothe Rhodians, also, an embassy was sent, to engage them to contributetheir share towards carrying on the war. Nor was Philip, who had bythis time arrived in Macedonia, remiss in his preparations for thecampaign. He sent his son Perseus, then very young, with part of hisforces to block up the pass near Pelagonia, appointing persons out ofthe number of his friends to direct his inexperienced age. Sciathusand Peparethus, no inconsiderable cities, he demolished, lest theyshould become a prey and prize to the enemy's fleet; despatching atthe same time ambassadors to the Aetolians, lest that restless nationmight change sides on the arrival of the Romans."Book 31,Chapter 29,"The assembly of the Aetolians, which they call Panaetolium, wasto meet on a certain day. In order to be present at this, the king'sambassadors hastened their journey, and Lucius Furius Purpureo alsoarrived, deputed by the consul. Ambassadors from the Athenians,likewise, came to this assembly. The Macedonians were first heard, aswith them the latest treaty had been made; and they declared, thatas no change of circumstances had occurred, they had nothing new tointroduce: for the same reasons which had induced them to make peacewith Philip, after experiencing the unprofitableness of an alliancewith the Romans, should engage them to preserve it now that it wasestablished. ""Do you rather choose,"" said one of the ambassadors, ""toimitate the inconsistency, or levity, shall I call it, of the Romans,who ordered this answer to be given to your ambassadors at Rome: 'Why,Aetolians, do you apply to us, when, without our approbation, you havemade peace with Philip?' Yet these same people now require that youshould, in conjunction with them, wage war against Philip. Formerly,too, they pretended that they took arms on your account, and in yourdefence against Philip: now they do not allow you to continue at peacewith him. To assist Messana, they first embarked for Sicily; and asecond time, that they might redeem Syracuse to freedom when oppressedby the Carthaginians. Both Messana and Syracuse, and all Sicily, theyhold in their own possession, and have reduced it into a tributaryprovince under their axes and rods. You imagine, perhaps, that in thesame manner as you hold an assembly at Naupactus, according to yourown laws, under magistrates created by yourselves, at liberty tochoose allies and enemies, and to have peace or war at your ownoption, so the assembly of the states of Sicily is summoned, toSyracuse, or Messana, or Lilybaeum. No, a Roman praetor presides atthe meeting; summoned by his command they assemble; they behold him,attended by his lictors seated on a lofty throne, issuing his haughtyedicts. His rods are ready for their backs, his axes for their necks,and every year they are allotted a different master. Neither oughtthey nor can they, wonder at this, when they see all the cities ofItaly bending under the same yoke,--Rhegium, Tarentum Capua, not tomention those in their own neighbourhood, out of the ruins of whichtheir city of Rome grew into power. Capua indeed subsists, the graveand monument of the Campanian people, that entire people having beeneither cut off or driven into banishment; the mutilated carcass of acity, without senate, without commons, without magistrates; a sort ofprodigy, the leaving which to be inhabited, showed more cruelty thanif it had been utterly destroyed. If foreigners who are separated fromus to a greater distance by their language, manners, and laws, than bythe distance by sea and land, are allowed to get footing here, it ismadness to hope that any thing will continue in its present state.Does the sovereignty of Philip seem in any degree incompatible withyour freedom, who, at a time when he was justly incensed against you,demanded nothing more of you than peace; and at present requires nomore than the observance of the peace which he agreed to? Accustomforeign legions to these countries, and receive the yoke; too late,and in vain, will you look for Philip as an ally, when you shall havethe Roman as a master. Trifling causes occasionally unite and disunitethe Aetolians, Acarnanians, and Macedonians, men speaking the samelanguage. With foreigners, with barbarians, all Greeks have, and everwill have, eternal war: because they are enemies by nature, which isalways the same, and not from causes which change with the times. Mydiscourse shall conclude with the same argument with which it began.Three years since, the same persons, assembled in this same place,determined on peace with the same Philip, contrary to the inclinationsof the same Romans, who now wish that the peace should be broken,after it has been adjusted and ratified. In the subject of yourdeliberation, fortune has made no change; why you should make any, Ido not see."""Book 31,Chapter 30,"Next, after the Macedonians, with the consent and at the desireof the Romans, the Athenians were introduced; who, having sufferedgrievously, could, with the greater justice, inveigh against thecruelty and inhumanity of the king. They represented, in a deplorablelight, the miserable devastation and spoliation of their fields;adding, that ""they did not complain on account of having, from anenemy, suffered hostile treatment; for there were certain rights ofwar, according to which, as it was just to act, so it was just toendure. Their crops being burned, their houses demolished, theirmen and cattle carried off as spoil, were to be considered rather asmisfortunes to the sufferer than as ill-treatment. But of this theyhad good reason to complain, that he who called the Romans foreignersand barbarians, had himself so atrociously violated all rights, bothdivine and human, as, in his former inroad, to have waged an impiouswar against the infernal gods, in the latter, against those above.That the sepulchres and monuments of all within their country had beendemolished, the graves laid open, and the bones left unprotected bythe soil. There had been several temples, which, in former times, whentheir ancestors dwelt in the country in their separate districts,had been consecrated in each of their little forts and villages, andwhich, even after they were incorporated into one city, they did notneglect or forsake. That around all these temples Philip had scatteredhis destructive flames, and left the images of the gods lying scorchedand mutilated among the prostrated pillars of their fanes. Such ashe had rendered the country of Attica, formerly opulent and adorned,such, if he were suffered, would he render Aetolia and the whole ofGreece. That the mutilation of their own city, also, would have beensimilar, if the Romans had not come to its relief: for he had shownthe same wicked rage against the gods who are the guardians of thecity, and Minerva who presides over the citadel; the same against thetemple of Ceres at Eleusis; the same against Jupiter and Minerva atPiraeeus. In a word, having been repelled by force of arms not onlyfrom their temples, but even from their walls, he had vented his furyon those sacred edifices which were protected by religion alone. Theytherefore entreated and besought the Aetolians, that, compassionatingthe Athenians, and with the immortal gods for their leaders, and,under them, the Romans, who, next to the gods, possessed the greatestpower they would take part in the war."""Book 31,Chapter 31,"The Roman ambassador then replied: ""The Macedonians first, andafterwards the Athenians, have obliged me to change entirely themethod of my discourse. For, on the one hand, the Macedonians, byaggressively introducing charges against the Romans, when I had comeprepared to make complaint of the injuries committed by Philip againstso many cities in alliance with us, have obliged me to think ofdefence rather than accusation; and, on the other hand, what have theAthenians, after relating his inhuman and impious crimes against thegods both celestial and infernal, left for me, or any one else, whichI can further urge against him. You are to suppose, that the samecomplaints are made by the Cianians, Abydenians, Aeneans, Maronites,Thasians, Parians, Samians, Larissenians, Messenians, on the side ofAchaia; and complaints, still heavier and more grievous, by those whomhe had it more in his power to injure. For as to those proceedingswhich he censures in us, if they are not deserving of honour, I willadmit that they cannot be defended at all. He has objected to us,Rhegium, and Capua, and Syracuse. As to Rhegium, during the warwith Pyrrhus, a legion which, at the earnest request of the Rhegiansthemselves, we had sent thither as a garrison, wickedly possessedthemselves of the city which they had been sent to defend. Did we thenapprove of that deed? or did we exert the force of our arms againstthat guilty legion, until we reduced them under our power; and then,after making them give satisfaction to the allies, by their stripesand the loss of their heads, restore to the Rhegians their city, theirlands, and all their effects, together with their liberty and laws? Tothe Syracusans, when oppressed, and that by foreign tyrants, whichwas a still greater indignity, we lent assistance; and after enduringgreat fatigues in carrying on the siege of so strong a city, bothby land and sea, for almost three years, (although the Syracusansthemselves chose to continue in slavery to the tyrants rather than betaken to us,) yet, becoming masters of the place, and by exertionof the same force setting it at liberty, we restored it to theinhabitants. At the same time, we do not deny that Sicily is ourprovince, and that the states which sided with the Carthaginians, and,in conjunction with them, waged war against us, pay us tribute andtaxes; on the contrary, we wish that you and all nations should know,that the condition of each is such as it has deserved at our hands:and ought we to repent of the punishment inflicted on the Campanians,of which even they themselves cannot complain? These men, after we hadon their account carried on war against the Samnites for near seventyyears, with great loss on our side; had united them to ourselves,first by treaty, and then by intermarriages, and the relationshipsarising thence; and lastly, by the right of citizenship; yet, in thetime of our adversity, were the first of all the states of Italy whichrevolted to Hannibal, after basely putting our garrison to death, andafterwards, through resentment at being besieged by us, sent Hannibalto attack Rome. If neither their city nor one man of them had beenleft remaining, who could take offence, or consider them as treatedwith more severity than they had deserved? From consciousness ofguilt, greater numbers of them perished by their own hands, than bythe punishments inflicted by us. And while from the rest we took awaythe town and the lands, still we left them a place to dwell in, wesuffered the city which partook not of the guilt to stand uninjured;so that he who should see it this day would find no trace of itshaving been besieged or taken. But why do I speak of Capua, when evento vanquished Carthage we granted peace and liberty? The greatestdanger is, that, by our too great readiness to pardon the conquered,we may encourage others to try the fortune of war against us. Letso much suffice in our defence, and against Philip, whose domesticcrimes, whose parricides and murders of his relations and friends, andwhose lust, more disgraceful to human nature, if possible, than hiscruelty, you, as being nearer to Macedonia, are better acquaintedwith. As to what concerns yourselves, Aetolians, we entered into awar with Philip on your account: you made peace with him withoutconsulting us. Perhaps you will say, that while we were occupiedin the Punic war, you were constrained by fear to accept terms ofpacification, from him who at that time possessed superior power;and that on our side, pressed by more urgent affairs we suspendedour operations in a war which you had laid aside. At present, aswe, having, by the favour of the gods brought the Punic war to aconclusion, have fallen on Macedonia with the whole weight of ourpower, so you have an opportunity offered you of regaining a place inour friendship and alliance, unless you choose to perish with Philip,rather than to conquer with the Romans."""Book 31,Chapter 32,"When these things had been said by the ambassador the minds ofall leaning towards the Romans, Damocritus, praetor of the Aetolians,(who, it was reported, had received money from the king,) assenting inno degree to one party or the other, said,--that ""in consultations ofgreat and critical importance, nothing was so injurious as haste. Thatrepentance, indeed, generally followed, and that quickly but yet toolate and unavailing; because designs carried on with precipitationcould not be recalled, nor matters brought back to their originalstate. The time, however, for determining the point underconsideration, which, for his part, he thought should not be tooearly, might yet immediately be fixed in this manner. As it had beenprovided by the laws, that no determination should be made concerningpeace or war, except in the Panaetolic or Pylaic councils; let themimmediately pass a decree, that the praetor, when he chooses to treatrespecting war and peace, may have full authority to summon a council,and that whatever shall be then debated and decreed, shall be, to allintents and purposes, legal and valid, as if it had been transactedin the Panaetolic or Pylaic assembly."" And thus dismissing theambassadors, with the matter undetermined, he said, that thereinhe had acted most prudently for the interest of the state; for theAetolians would have it in their power to join in alliance withwhichever of the parties should be more successful in the war. Suchwere the proceedings in the council of the Aetolians."Book 31,Chapter 33,"Meanwhile Philip was making vigorous preparations for carryingon the war both by sea and land. His naval forces he drew together atDemetrias in Thessaly; supposing that Attalus, and the Roman fleet,would move from Aegina in the beginning of the spring. He gave thecommand of the fleet and of the sea-coast to Heraclides, to whom hehad formerly intrusted it. The equipment of the land forces he tookcare of in person; considering that he had deprived the Romans of twopowerful auxiliaries, the Aetolians on the one side and the Dardanianson the other, by making his son Perseus block up the pass atPelagonia. The consul was employed, not in preparations, but inthe operations of war. He led his army through the country of theDassaretians, conveying the corn untouched which he had brought fromhis winter quarters, for the fields afforded supplies sufficient forthe consumption of the troops. The towns and villages surrendered tohim, some through inclination, others through fear; some were takenby assault, others were found deserted, the barbarians flying to theneighbouring mountains. He fixed a standing camp at Lycus near theriver Bevus, and from thence sent to bring in corn from the magazinesof the Dassaretians. Philip saw the whole country filled withconsternation, and not knowing the designs of the consul, he sent aparty of horse to discover whither he was directing his course. Thesame state of uncertainty possessed the consul; he knew that theking had moved from his winter quarters, but in what direction he hadproceeded he knew not: he also had sent horsemen to gain intelligence.These two parties, having set out from opposite quarters, afterwandering a long time among the Dassaretians, through unknown roads,fell at length into the same track. Neither doubted, as soon as thenoise of men and horses was heard at a distance, that the enemy wasapproaching, therefore, before they came within sight of each other,they got their arms in readiness, nor, when they saw their foe, wasthere any delay in engaging. As they happened to be nearly equal innumber and valour, being picked men on both sides, they fought duringseveral hours with vigour, until fatigue, both of men and horses, putan end to the fight, without deciding the victory. Of the Macedoniansthere fell forty horsemen; of the Romans thirty-five. Still, however,neither did the one party carry back to the king, nor the other to theconsul, any certain information in what quarter the camp of his enemylay. But this was soon made known to them by deserters, whom theirrecklessness of disposition supplies in all wars in sufficient numberto discover the affairs of the contending parties."Book 31,Chapter 34,"Philip, judging that he should make some progress towardsconciliating the affections of his men, and induce them to face dangermore readily on his account, if he bestowed some pains on the burialof the horsemen who fell in that expedition, ordered them to beconveyed into the camp, in order that all might be spectators of thehonours paid them at their funeral. Nothing is so uncertain, or sodifficult to form a judgment of, as the minds of the multitude. Thatwhich seems calculated to increase their alacrity, in exertions ofevery sort, often creates in them fear and inactivity. Accordingly,those who, being always accustomed to fight with Greeks and Illyrians,had only seen wounds made with javelins and arrows, seldom even bylances, came to behold bodies dismembered by the Spanish sword, somewith their arms lopped off, with the shoulder or the neck entirely cutthrough, heads severed from the trunk, and the bowels laid open, withother frightful exhibitions of wounds: they therefore perceived, withhorror, against what weapons and what men they were to fight. Even theking himself was seized with apprehensions, having never yet engagedthe Romans in a regular battle. Wherefore, recalling his son, and theguard posted at the pass of Pelagonia, in order to strengthen hisarmy by the addition of those troops, he thereby opened a passage intoMacedonia for Pleuratus and the Dardanians. Then, taking desertersfor guides, he marched towards the enemy with twenty thousand footand four thousand horse, and at the distance of somewhat more than athousand paces from the Roman camp, and near Ithacus, he fortified ahill with a trench and rampart. From this place, taking a view of theRoman station in the valley beneath, he is said to have been struckwith admiration, both at the general appearance of the camp, and theregular disposition of each particular part; then with the dispositionof the tents, and the intervals of the passages; and to have declared,that, certainly, that could not be regarded by any as the camp ofbarbarians. For two days, the consul and the king, each waitingfor the other's making some attempt, kept their troops within theramparts. On the third day, the Roman led out all his forces, andoffered battle."Book 31,Chapter 35,"But the king, not daring to risk so hastily a general engagement,sent four hundred Trallians, who are a tribe of the Illyrians, as wehave said in another place, and three hundred Cretans; adding tothis body of infantry an equal number of horse, under the command ofAthenagoras, one of his nobles honoured with the purple, to make anattack on the enemy's cavalry. When these troops arrived within alittle more than five hundred paces, the Romans sent out the lightinfantry, and two cohorts of horse, that both cavalry and infantrymight be equal in number to the Macedonians. The king's troopsexpected that the method of fighting would be such as they had beenaccustomed to; that the horsemen, pursuing and retreating alternately,would at one time use their weapons, at another time turn their backs;that the agility of the Illyrians would be serviceable for excursionsand sudden attacks, and that the Cretans might discharge their arrowsagainst the enemy, as they advanced eagerly to the charge. But theonset of the Romans, which was not more vigorous than persevering,entirely disconcerted this method of fighting: for the light infantry,as if they were fighting with their whole line of battle, afterdischarging their javelins, carried on a close fight with theirswords; and the horsemen, when they had once made a charge, stoppingtheir horses, fought, some on horseback, while others dismounted andintermixed themselves with the foot. By this means neither were theking's cavalry, who were unaccustomed to a steady fight, a matchfor the others; nor were the infantry, who were only skirmishing andirregular troops, and were besides but half covered with the kindof harness which they used, at all equal to the Roman infantry, whocarried a sword and buckler, and were furnished with proper armour,both to defend themselves and to annoy the enemy: nor did they sustainthe combat, but fled to their camp, trusting entirely to their speedfor safety."Book 31,Chapter 36,"After an interval of one day, the king, resolving to make anattack with all his forces of cavalry and light-armed infantry, had,during the night, placed in ambush, in a convenient place between thetwo camps, a body of targeteers, whom they call Peltastae, and givenorders to Athenagoras and the cavalry, if they found they had theadvantage in the open fight, to pursue their success; if otherwise,that they should retreat leisurely, and by that means draw on theenemy to the place where the ambush lay. The cavalry accordinglydid retreat; but the officers of the body of targeteers, by bringingforward their men before the time, and not waiting for the signal, asthey ought, lost an opportunity of performing considerable service.The Romans, having gained the victory in open fight, and also escapedthe danger of the ambuscade, retired to their camp. Next day theconsul marched out with all his forces, and offered battle, placinghis elephants in the front of the foremost battalions. Of thisresource the Romans then for the first time availed themselves; havinga number of them which had been taken in the Punic war. Finding thatthe enemy kept himself quiet behind his intrenchments, headvanced close up to them, upbraiding him with cowardice; and as,notwithstanding, no opportunity of an engagement was afforded, theconsul, considering how dangerous foraging must be while the campslay so near each other, where the cavalry were ready at any moment toattack the soldiers, when dispersed through the country, removed hiscamp to a place called Ortholophus, distant about eight miles, whereby reason of the intervening distance he could forage with moresafety. While the Romans were collecting corn in the adjacent fields,the king kept his men within the trenches, in order to increase boththe negligence and confidence of the enemy. But, when he saw themscattered, he set out with all his cavalry, and the auxiliary Cretans,and marching with such speed that the swiftest footmen could, byrunning, but just keep up with the horse, he planted his standardsbetween the camp of the Romans and their foragers. Then, dividingthe forces, he sent one part of them in quest of the marauders, withorders to leave not one alive; with the other, he himself halted, andplaced guards on the roads through which the enemy seemed likely tofly back to their camp. And now carnage and flight prevailed in alldirections, and no intelligence of the misfortune had yet reached theRoman camp, because those who fled towards the camp fell in with theguards, which the king had stationed to intercept them, and greaternumbers were slain by those who were placed in the roads, than bythose who had been sent out to attack them. At length, a few effectedtheir escape, through the midst of the enemy's posts, but were sofilled with terror, that they excited a general consternation in thecamp, rather than brought intelligible information."Book 31,Chapter 37,"The consul, ordering the cavalry to carry aid to those who were indanger, in the best manner they could, drew out the legions fromthe camp, and led them drawn up in a square towards the enemy. Thecavalry, taking different ways through the fields, missed the road,being deceived by the various shouts raised in several quarters. Someof them met with the enemy, and battles began in many places at once.The hottest part of the action was at the station where the kingcommanded; for the guard there was, in numbers both of horse and foot,almost a complete army; and, as they were posted on the middle road,the greatest number of the Romans fell in with them. The Macedonianshad also the advantage in this, that the king himself was present toencourage them; and the Cretan auxiliaries, fighting in goodorder, and in a state of preparation, against troops disorderedand irregular, wounded many at a distance, where no such danger wasapprehended. If they had acted with prudence in the pursuit, theywould have secured an advantage of great importance, not only inregard to the glory of the present contest, but to the generalinterest of the war; but, greedy of slaughter, and following with toomuch eagerness, they fell in with the advanced cohorts of the Romansunder the military tribunes. The horsemen who were flying, as soon asthey saw the ensigns of their friends, faced about against the enemy,now in disorder; so that in a moment's time the fortune of the battlewas changed, those now turning their backs who had lately been thepursuers. Many were slain in close fight, many in the pursuit; nor wasit by the sword alone that they perished; several, being driven intomorasses, were, together with their horses, swallowed up in thedeep mud. The king himself was in danger; for his horse falling, inconsequence of a wound, threw him headlong to the ground, and he verynarrowly escaped being overpowered while prostrate. He owed his safetyto a trooper, who instantly leaped down and mounted the affrightedking on his horse; himself, as he could not on foot keep up with theflying horsemen, was slain by the enemy, who had collected about theplace where Philip fell. The king, in his desperate flight, rode aboutamong the morasses, some of which were easily passed, and others not;at length, when most men despaired of his ever escaping in safety,he arrived in safety at his camp. Two hundred Macedonian horsemenperished in that action; about one hundred were taken: eighty horses,richly caparisoned, were led off the field; at the same time thespoils of arms were also carried off."Book 31,Chapter 38,"There were some who found fault with the king, as guilty ofrashness on that day; and with the consul, for want of energy. ForPhilip, they say, on his part, ought to have avoided coming toaction, knowing that in a few days the enemy, having exhausted all theadjacent country, must be reduced to the extremity of want; and thatthe consul, after having routed the Macedonian cavalry and lightinfantry, and nearly taken the king himself, ought to have led on histroops directly to the enemy's camp, where, dismayed as they were,they would have made no stand, and that he might have finished the warin a moment's time. This, like most other matters, was easier to betalked about than to be done. For, if the king had brought the wholeof his infantry into the engagement, then, indeed, during the tumult,and while, vanquished and struck with dismay, they fled from the fieldinto their intrenchments, (and even continued their flight from thenceon seeing the victorious enemy mounting the ramparts,) the king mighthave been deprived of his camp. But as some forces of infantry hadremained in the camp, fresh and free from fatigue, with outpostsbefore the gates, and guard properly disposed, what would he have donebut imitated the rashness of which the king had just now been guilty,by pursuing the routed horse? On the other side, the king's firstplan of an attack on the foragers, while dispersed through the fields,would not have been a subject of censure, could he have satisfiedhimself with a moderate degree of success: and it is the lesssurprising that he should have made a trial of fortune, as there wasa report, that Pleuratus and the Dardanians had set out from home withvery numerous forces, and had already passed into Macedonia; so thatif he should be surrounded on all sides by these forces, there wasreason to think that the Roman might put an end to the war withoutstirring from his seat. Philip, however, considered, that after hiscavalry had been defeated in two engagements, he could with much lesssafety continue in the same post; accordingly, wishing to remove fromthence, and, at the same time, to keep the enemy in ignorance of hisdesign, he sent a herald to the consul a little before sun-set, todemand a truce for the purpose of burying the horsemen; and thusimposing on him, he began his march in silence, about the secondwatch, leaving a number of fires in all parts of his camp."Book 31,Chapter 39,"The consul was now taking refreshment, when he was told that theherald had arrived, and on what business; he gave him no other answer,than that he should be admitted to an audience early the next morning:by which means Philip gained what he wanted--the length of that night,and part of the following day, during which he might get the start onhis march. He directed his route towards the mountains, a road whichhe knew the Romans with their heavy baggage would not attempt. Theconsul, having, at the first light, dismissed the herald with a grantof a truce, in a short time after discovered that the enemy hadgone off; but not knowing what course to take in pursuit of them,he remained in the same camp for several days, which he employed incollecting forage. He then marched to Stubera, and brought thither,from Pelagonia, the corn that was in the fields. From thence headvanced to Pluvina, not having yet discovered to what quarter theMacedonian had bent his course. Philip, having at first fixed his campat Bryanium, marched thence through cross-roads, and gave a suddenalarm to the enemy. The Romans, on this, removed from Pluvina, andpitched their camp near the river Osphagus. The king also sat downat a small distance, forming his intrenchment on the bank of a riverwhich the inhabitants call Erigonus. Having there received certaininformation that the Romans intended to proceed to Eordaea, he marchedaway before them, in order to take possession of the defiles, andprevent the enemy from making their way, where the roads are confinedin narrow straits. There, with great haste, he fortified some placeswith a rampart, others with a trench, others with stones heaped upinstead of walls, others with trees laid across, according as thesituation required, or as materials lay convenient; and thus a road,in its own nature difficult, he rendered, as he imagined, impregnableby the works which he drew across every pass. The adjoining ground,being mostly covered with woods, was exceedingly incommodious to thephalanx of the Macedonians, which is of no manner of use, except whenthey extend their very long spears before their shields, forming asit were a palisade; to perform which, they require an open plain. TheThracians, too, were embarrassed by their lances, which also are ofa great length, and were entangled among the branches that stoodin their way on every side. The body of Cretans alone was notunserviceable; and yet even these, though, in case of an attack madeon them, they could to good purpose discharge their arrows againstthe horses or riders, where they were open to a wound, yet against theRoman shields they could do nothing, because they had neither strengthsufficient to pierce through them, nor was there any part exposed atwhich they could aim. Perceiving, therefore, that kind of weapon tobe useless, they annoyed the enemy with stones, which lay in plenty inall parts of the valley: the strokes made by these on their shields,with greater noise than injury, for a short time retarded the advanceof the Romans; but quickly disregarding these missiles also, some,closing their shields in form of a tortoise, forced their way throughthe enemy in front; others having, by a short circuit, gained thesummit of the hill, dislodged the dismayed Macedonians from theirguards and posts, and even slew the greater part of them, theirretreat being embarrassed by the difficulties of the ground."Book 31,Chapter 40,"Thus, with less opposition than they had expected to meet, thedefiles were passed, and they came to Eordaea; then, having laid wastethe whole country, the consul withdrew into Elimea. From thencehe made an irruption into Orestis, and attacked the city Celetrum,situated in a peninsula: a lake surrounds the walls; and there is butone entrance from the main land along a narrow isthmus. Relying ontheir situation, the townsmen at first shut the gates, and refusedto submit; but afterwards, when they saw the troops in motion, andadvancing in the tortoise method, and the isthmus covered by the enemymarching in, they surrendered in terror rather than hazard a struggle.From Celetrum he advanced into the country of the Dassaretians, tookthe city Pelium by storm, carried off the slaves with the rest of thespoil, and discharging the freemen without ransom, restored thecity to them, after placing a strong garrison in it, for it was veryconveniently situated for making inroads into Macedonia. Having thustraversed the enemy's country, the consul led back his forces intothose parts which were already reduced to obedience near Apollonia,from whence the campaign had commenced. Philip's attention had beendrawn to other quarters by the Aetolians, Athamanians, and Dardanians:so many were the wars that started up on different sides of him.Against the Dardanians, who were now retiring out of Macedonia, hesent Athenagoras with the light infantry and the greater part of thecavalry, and ordered him to hang on their rear as they retreated; and,by cutting off their hindmost troops, make them more cautious for thefuture of leading out their armies from home. As to the Aetolians,Damocritus, their praetor, the same who at Naupactum had persuadedthem to defer passing a decree concerning the war, had in the nextmeeting roused them to arms, after the report of the battle betweenthe cavalry at Ortholophus; the irruption of the Dardanians and ofPleuratus, with the Illyrians, into Macedonia; of the arrival of theRoman fleet, too, at Oreus; and that Macedonia, besides being beset onall sides by so many nations, was in danger of being invested by seaalso."Book 31,Chapter 41,"These reasons had brought back Damocritus and the Aetolians to theinterest of the Romans. Marching out, therefore, in conjunction withAmynander, king of the Athamanians, they laid siege to Cercinium. Theinhabitants here had shut their gates, whether of their own choice orby compulsion is unknown, as they had a garrison of the king's troops.However, in a few days Cercinium was taken and burned; and after greatslaughter had been made, those who survived, both freemen and slaves,were carried off amongst other spoil. This caused such terror, as madeall those who dwelt round the lake Baebius abandon their cities andfly to the mountains: and the Aetolians, in the absence of booty,turned away from thence, and proceeded into Perrhaebia. There theytook Cyretiae by storm and sacked it unmercifully. The inhabitants ofMallaea, making a voluntary submission, were received into alliance.From Perrhaebia, Amynander advised to march to Gomphi, because thatcity lies close to Athamania, and there was reason to think that itmight be reduced without any great difficulty. But the Aetolians,for the sake of plunder, directed their march to the rich plains ofThessaly. Amynander following, though he did not approve either oftheir careless method of carrying on their depredations, or of theirpitching their camp in any place which chance presented, withoutchoice, and without taking any care to fortify it. Therefore, lesttheir rashness and negligence might be the cause of some misfortuneto himself and his troops, when he saw them forming their camp in lowgrounds, under the city Phecadus, he took possession, with his owntroops, of an eminence about five hundred paces distant, which couldbe rendered secure by a slight fortification. The Aetolians seemed tohave forgotten that they were in an enemy's country, excepting thatthey continued to plunder, some straggling about half-armed, othersspending whole days and nights alike in drinking and sleeping in thecamp, neglecting even to fix guards, when Philip unexpectedly cameupon them. His approach being announced by those who had fled out ofthe fields in a fright, Damocritus and the rest of the officers werethrown into great confusion. It happened to be mid-day, and when mostof the men after a hearty meal lay fast asleep. Their officersroused them, however, as fast as possible; ordered them to take arms;despatched some to recall those who were straggling through the fieldsin search of plunder; and so violent was their hurry, that many ofthe horsemen went out without their swords, and but few of them puton their corslets. After marching out in this precipitate manner, (thewhole horse and foot scarcely making up six hundred,) they met theking's cavalry, superior in number, in spirit, and in arms. They were,therefore, routed at the first charge; and having scarcely attemptedresistance, returned to the camp in shameful flight. Several wereslain; and some taken, having been cut off from the main body of thefugitives."Book 31,Chapter 42,"Philip, when his troops had advanced almost to the rampart,ordered a retreat to be sounded, because both men and horses werefatigued, not so much by the action, as at once by the length of theirmarch, and the extraordinary celerity with which they had made it.He therefore despatched the horsemen by troops, and the companies oflight infantry in turn, to procure water and take refreshment. Therest he kept on guard, under arms, waiting for the main body of theinfantry, which had marched with less expedition, on account of theweight of their armour. As soon as these arrived, they also wereordered to fix their standards, and, laying down their arms beforethem, to take food in haste; sending two, or at most three, out ofeach company, to provide water. In the mean time the cavalry and lightinfantry stood in order, and ready, in case the enemy should makeany movement. The Aetolians, as if resolved to defend theirfortifications, (the multitude which had been scattered about thefields having, by this time, returned to the camp,) posted bodiesof armed men at the gates, and on the rampart, and from this safesituation looked with a degree of confidence on the enemy, as long asthey continued quiet. But, as soon as the troops of the Macedoniansbegan to move, and to advance to the rampart, in order of battle, andready for an assault, they all quickly abandoned their posts, andfled through the opposite part of the camp, to the eminence where theAthamanians were stationed. During their flight in this confusion,many of the Aetolians were slain, and many made prisoners. Philipdoubted not that, had there been daylight enough remaining, he shouldhave been able to make himself master of the camp of the Athamaniansalso; but the day having been spent in the fight, and in plunderingthe camp afterwards, he sat down under the eminence, in the adjacentplain, determined to attack the enemy at the first dawn of thefollowing day. But the Aetolians, under the same apprehensions whichhad made them desert their camp, dispersed, and fled during thefollowing night. Amynander was of the greatest service; for, by hisdirections, the Athamanians, who were acquainted with the roads,conducted them into Aetolia, whilst the Macedonians pursued themover the highest mountains, through unknown paths. In this disorderlyflight, a few, missing their way, fell into the hands of theMacedonian horsemen, whom Philip, at the earliest dawn, on seeing theeminence abandoned, had sent to harass the marching body of the enemy."Book 31,Chapter 43,"About the same time also Athenagoras, one of the king's generals,overtaking the Dardanians in their retreat homeward, at first threwtheir rear into disorder; but these unexpectedly facing about, andforming their line, the fight became like a regular engagement. Whenthe Dardanians began again to advance, the Macedonian cavalry andlight infantry harassed those who had no troops of that kind to aidthem, and were, besides, burdened with unwieldy arms. The ground, too,favoured the assailants: very few were slain, but many wounded; nonewere taken, because they rarely quit their ranks, but both fight andretreat in a close body. Thus Philip, having checked the proceedingsof those two nations by these well-timed expeditions, gainedreparation for the damages sustained from the operations of theRomans; the enterprise being as spirited as the issue was successful.An occurrence which accidentally happened to him lessened the numberof his enemies on the side of Aetolia. Scopas, a man of considerableinfluence in his own country, having been sent from Alexandria by kingPtolemy, with a great sum of gold, hired and carried away to Egypt sixthousand foot and four hundred horse; nor would he have suffered oneof the young Aetolians to remain at home, had not Damocritus, (it isnot easy to say, whether out of zeal for the good of the nation, orout of opposition to Scopas, for not having secured his interest bypresents,) by sometimes reminding them of the war which threatenedthem, at other times, of the solitary condition in which they wouldbe, detained some of them at home by severe reproaches. Such were theactions of the Romans, and of Philip, during that summer."Book 31,Chapter 44,"In the beginning of the same summer, the fleet under LuciusApustius, lieutenant-general, setting sail from Corcyra, and passingby Malea, formed a junction with king Attalus, off Scyllaeum, whichlies in the district of Hermione. The Athenian state, which had fora long time, through fear, restrained their animosity against Philipwithin some bounds, in the expectation of approaching aid affordedthem, gave full scope to it all. There are never wanting in that cityorators, who are ready on every occasion to inflame the people; akind of men, who, in all free states, and more particularly in thatof Athens, where eloquence flourishes in the highest degree, aremaintained by the favour of the multitude. These immediately proposeda decree, and the commons passed it, that ""all the statues and imagesof Philip, with their inscriptions, and likewise those of all hisancestors, male and female, should be taken down and destroyed; thatthe festal days, solemnities, and priests, which had been institutedin honour of him or of his predecessors, should all be abolished;and that even the ground where any such statue had been set up,and inscribed to his honour, should be held abominable."" And it wasresolved, that, ""for the future, nothing which ought to be erected ordedicated in a place of purity should be there erected; and that thepublic priests, as often as they should pray for the people of Athens,for their allies, armies, and fleets, so often should they uttercurses and execrations against Philip, his offspring, his kingdom,his forces by sea and land, and the whole race and name of theMacedonians."" It was added to the decree, that, ""if any person infuture should make any proposal tending to throw disgrace and ignominyon Philip, the people of Athens would ratify it in its fullest extent:if, on the contrary, any one should, by word or deed, endeavour tolessen his ignominy, or to do him honour, that whoever slew him whoshould have so said or done, should be justified in so doing."" Lastly,a clause was annexed, that ""all the decrees, formerly passed againstthe Pisistratidae, should be in full force against Philip."" Thus theAthenians waged war against Philip with writings and with words, inwhich alone their power consisted."Book 31,Chapter 45,"Attalus and the Romans, having, from Hermione, proceeded first toPiraeus, and staid there a few days, after being loaded with decreesof the Athenians, (in which the honours paid to their allies were asextravagant as the expressions of their resentment against their enemyhad been,) sailed from Piraeus to Andros, and, coming to an anchor inthe harbour called Gaureleos, sent persons to sound the inclinationsof the townsmen, whether they chose voluntarily to surrender theircity, rather than run the hazard of an assault. On their answering,that they were not at their own disposal, but that the citadelwas occupied by the king's troops, Attalus and the Romanlieutenant-general, landing their forces, with every thing requisitefor attacking towns, made their approaches to the city on differentsides. The Roman standards and arms, which they had never seen before,together with the spirit of the soldiers, so briskly approachingthe walls, were particularly terrifying to the Greeks. A retreat wasimmediately made into the citadel, and the enemy took possession ofthe city. After holding out for two days in the citadel, relying moreon the strength of the place than on their arms, on the third boththey and the garrison surrendered the city and citadel, on conditionof their being transported to Delium in Boeotia, and being each ofthem allowed a single suit of apparel. The island was yielded up bythe Romans to king Attalus; the spoil, and the ornaments of the city,they themselves carried off. Attalus, desirous that the island, ofwhich he had got possession, might not be quite deserted, persuadedalmost all the Macedonians, and several of the Andrians, toremain there: and, in some time after, those who, according to thecapitulation, had been transported to Delium, were induced to returnfrom thence by the promises made them by the king, in which they weredisposed the more readily to confide, by the ardent affection whichthey felt for their native country. From Andros they passed over toCythnus; there they spent several days, to no purpose, in assaultingthe city; when, at length, finding it scarcely worth the trouble, theydeparted. At Prasiae, a place on the main land of Attica, twenty barksof the Issaeans joined the Roman fleet. These were sent to ravage thelands of the Carystians, the rest of the fleet lying at Geraestus, anoted harbour in Euboea, until the Issaeans returned from Carystus:on which, setting sail all together, and steering their course throughthe open sea, until they passed by Scyrus, they arrived at the islandof Icus. Being detained there for a few days by a violent northerlywind, as soon as the weather was fair, they passed over to Sciathus,a city which had been lately plundered and desolated by Philip. Thesoldiers, spreading themselves over the country, brought back to theships corn and what other kinds of provisions could be of use to them.Plunder there was none, nor had the Greeks deserved to be plundered.Directing their course thence to Cassandrea, they first came toMendis, a village on the coast of that state; and, intending fromthence to double the promontory, and bring round the fleet to the verywalls of the city, a violent tempest arising, they were near beingburied in the waves. However, after being dispersed, and a great partof the ships having lost their rigging, they escaped on shore. Thisstorm at sea was an omen of the kind of success which they wereto meet on land; for, after collecting their vessels together, andlanding their forces, having made an assault on the city, they wererepulsed with many wounds, there being a strong garrison of theking's troops in the place. Being thus obliged to retreat withoutaccomplishing their design, they passed over to Canastrum in Pallene,and from thence, doubling the promontory of Torona, conducted thefleet to Acanthus. There they first laid waste the country, thenstormed the city itself, and plundered it. They proceeded no farther,for their ships were now heavily laden with booty, but went back toSciathus, and from Sciathus to Euboea, whence they had first set out."Book 31,Chapter 46,"Leaving the fleet there, they entered the Malian bay with tenlight ships, in order to confer with the Aetolians on the method ofconducting the war. Sipyrrhicas, the Aetolian, was at the head of theembassy that came to Heraclea, to hold a consultation with the kingand the Roman lieutenant-general. They demanded of Attalus, that,in pursuance of the treaty, he should supply them with one thousandsoldiers, which number he had engaged for on condition of their takingpart in the war against Philip. This was refused to the Aetolians,because on their part they had formerly showed themselves unwilling tomarch out to ravage Macedonia, at a time when Philip, being employednear Pergamus in destroying by fire every thing sacred and profane,they might have compelled him to retire from thence, in order topreserve his own territories. Thus, instead of aid, the Aetolians weredismissed with hopes, the Romans making them large promises. Apustiuswith Attalus returned to the ships, where they began to concertmeasures for the siege of Oreus. This city was well secured byfortifications; and also, as an attempt had formerly been made onit, by a strong garrison. After the taking of Andros, twenty Rhodianships, all decked vessels, had formed a junction with them, under thecommand of Agesimbrotus. This squadron they sent to the station offZelasium, a promontory of Isthmia, very conveniently situate beyondDemetrias, in order that, if the ships of the Macedonians shouldattempt any movement, they might act as a defensive force. Heraclides,the king's admiral, kept his fleet there, rather with a view of layinghold of any advantage which the negligence of the enemy might affordhim, than with a design of attempting any thing by open force. TheRomans and king Attalus carried on their attacks against Oreus ondifferent sides; the Romans against the citadel next to the sea, theking's troops against the lower part of the town, lying between thetwo citadels, where the city is also divided by a wall. As their postswere different, so were their methods of attack: the Romans made theirapproaches by means of covered galleries, applying also the ram tothe walls; the king's troops, by throwing in weapons with the balista,catapulta, and every other kind of engine, and stones also of immenseweight. They formed mines, too, and made use of every expedient,which, on trial, had been found useful in the former siege. On theother side, not only did more Macedonians protect the town and thecitadels, than on the former occasion, but they exerted themselveswith greater spirit, in consequence of the reprimands which they hadreceived from the king for the misconduct they had committed, and alsofrom remembrance both of his threats and promises with regard to thefuture. Thus, when time was being consumed there, contrary to theirexpectation, and there was more hope from a siege and works than froma sudden assault, the lieutenant-general thought that in the mean timesome other business might be accomplished; wherefore, leaving such anumber of men as seemed sufficient to finish the works, he passed overto the nearest part of the continent, and, arriving unexpectedly, madehimself master of Larissa, except the citadel,--not that celebratedcity in Thessaly, but another, which they call Cremaste. Attalus alsosurprised Aegeleos, where nothing was less apprehended than such anenterprise during the siege of another city. The works at Oreus hadnow begun to take effect, while the garrison within were almost spentwith unremitted toil, (keeping watch both by day and night,) and alsowith wounds. Part of the wall, being loosened by the strokes of theram, had fallen down in many places; and the Romans, during the night,broke into the citadel through the breach which lay over the harbour.Attalus, likewise, at the first light, on a signal given from thecitadel by the Romans, himself also assaulted the city, where greatpart of the walls had been levelled; on which the garrison andtownsmen fled into the other citadel, and a surrender was made twodays after. The city fell to the king, the prisoners to the Romans."Book 31,Chapter 47,"The autumnal equinox now approached, and the Euboean gulf, calledCoela, is reckoned dangerous by mariners. Choosing, therefore, toremove thence before the winter storms came on, they returned toPiraeus, from whence they had set out for the campaign. Apustius,leaving there thirty ships, sailed by Malea to Corcyra. The king wasdelayed during the celebration of the mysteries of Ceres, that hemight assist at the solemnities, immediately after which he alsoretired into Asia, sending home Agesimbrotus and the Rhodians. Such,during that summer, were the proceedings, by sea and land, ofthe Roman consul and lieutenant-general, aided by Attalus and theRhodians, against Philip and his allies. The other consul, CaiusAurelius, on coming into his province and finding the war therealready brought to a conclusion, did not dissemble his resentmentagainst the praetor, for having proceeded to action in his absence;wherefore, sending him away to Etruria, he led on the legions into theenemy's country, and, by laying it waste, carried on the war with morespoil than glory. Lucius Furius, finding nothing in Etruria thatcould give him employment, and at the same time intent on obtaining atriumph for his success against the Gauls, which he considered wouldbe more easily accomplished in the absence of the consul, who enviedand was enraged against him, came to Rome unexpectedly, and called ameeting of the senate in the temple of Bellona; where, after makinga recital of the services which he had performed, he demanded to beallowed to enter the city in triumph."Book 31,Chapter 48,"With a great part of the senate he prevailed, owing to privateinterest and the importance of his services. The elder part refusedhim a triumph, both ""because the army, with which he had acted,belonged to another; and because he had left his province throughan ambitious desire of snatching that opportunity of procuring atriumph,--but that he had taken this course without any precedent.""The senators of consular rank particularly insisted, that ""he oughtto have waited for the consul; for that he might, by pitching his campnear the city, and thereby securing the colony without coming to anengagement, have protracted the affair until his arrival; and that,what the praetor had not done, the senate ought to do; they shouldwait for the consul. After hearing the business discussed by theconsul and praetor in their presence, they would be able, morecorrectly, to form judgment on the case."" Great part were of opinion,that the senate ought to consider nothing but the service performed,and whether he had performed it while in office, and under his ownauspices. For, ""when of two colonies, which had been opposed, asbarriers, to restrain the tumultuous inroads of the Gauls, one hadbeen already sacked and burned, the flames being ready to spread (asif from an adjoining house) to the other colony, which lay so near,what ought the praetor to have done? For if it was improper to enteron any action without the consul, then the senate had acted wrongin giving the army to the praetor; because, if they chose that thebusiness should be performed, not under the praetor's auspices, butthe consul's, they might have limited the decree in such a manner,that not the praetor, but the consul, should manage it; or else theconsul had acted wrong, who, after ordering the army to remove fromEtruria into Gaul, did not meet it at Ariminum, in order to be presentat operations, which were not allowed to be performed without him. Butthe exigencies of war do not wait for the delays and procrastinationsof commanders; and battles must be sometimes fought, not becausecommanders choose it, but because the enemy compels it. The fightitself, and the issue of the fight, is what ought to be regarded now.The enemy were routed and slain, their camp taken and plundered,the colony relieved from a siege, the prisoners taken from the othercolony recovered and restored to their friends, and an end put to thewar in one battle. And not only men rejoiced at this victory, but theimmortal gods also had supplications paid to them, for the space ofthree days, on account of the business of the state having been wiselyand successfully, not rashly and unfortunately, conducted by LuciusFurius, praetor. Besides, the Gallic wars were, by some fatality,destined to the Furian family."""Book 31,Chapter 49,"By means of discourses of this kind, made by him and his friends,the interest of the praetor, who was present, prevailed over thedignity of the absent consul, and the majority decreed a triumph toLucius Furius. Lucius Furius, praetor, during his office, triumphedover the Gauls. He carried into the treasury three hundred and twentythousand _asses_,[1] and one hundred and seventy thousand pounds'weight of silver. There were neither any prisoners led before hischariot, nor spoils carried before him, nor did any soldiers followhim. It appeared that every thing, except the victory, belonged tothe consul. The games which Publius Scipio had vowed when consul inAfrica, were then celebrated, in a magnificent manner and with respectto the lands for his soldiers, it was decreed, that whatever numberof years each of them had served in Spain or in Africa, he should,for every year, receive two acres; and that ten commissioners shoulddistribute that land. Three commissioners were then appointed to fillup the number of colonists at Venusia, because the strength of thatcolony had been reduced in the war with Hannibal: Caius TerentiusVarro, Titus Quintius Flamininus, Publius Cornelius, son of CneiusScipio, enrolled the colonists for Venusia. During the same year,Caius Cornelius Cethegus, who in the capacity of proconsul commandedin Spain, routed a numerous army of the enemy in the territory ofSedeta; in which battle, it is said, that fifteen thousand Spaniardswere slain, and seventy-eight military standards taken. The consulCaius Aurelius, on returning from his province to Rome to hold theelections, made heavy complaints, not on the subject on which they hadsupposed he would, that the senate had not waited for his coming, norallowed him an opportunity of arguing the matter with the praetor;but, that ""the senate had decreed a triumph in such a manner, withouthearing the report of any one of those who had taken part in the war,except the person who was to enjoy the triumph: that their ancestorshad made it a rule that the lieutenant-generals, the militarytribunes, the centurions, and even the soldiers, should be presentat the triumph, in order that the Roman people might ascertain thereality of his exploits, to whom so high an honour was paid."" Now, ofthat army which fought with the Gauls, had any one soldier, or even asoldier's servant, been present, of whom the senate could inquire howmuch of truth or falsehood was in the praetor's narrative? He thenappointed a day for the elections, at which were chosen consuls,Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Publius Villius Tappulus. The praetorswere then appointed, Lucius Quintius Flamininus, Lucius ValeriusFlaccus, Lucius Villius Tappulus, and Cneius Baebius Tamphilus."Book 31,Chapter 50,"During that year provisions were remarkably cheap. The curuleaediles, Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Sextus Aelius Paetus,distributed among the people a vast quantity of corn, brought fromAfrica, at the rate of two _asses_ a peck. They also celebrated theRoman games in a magnificent manner, repeating them a second day; anderected in the treasury five brazen statues out of the money paid asfines. The plebeian games were thrice repeated entire, by the aediles,Lucius Terentius Massa, and Cneius Baebius Tamphilus, who was electedpraetor. There were also funeral games exhibited that year in theforum, for the space of four days, on occasion of the death of MarcusValerius Laevinus, by his sons Publius and Marcus, who gave also ashow of gladiators, in which twenty-five pairs fought. Marcus AureliusCotta, one of the decemviri of the sacred books, died, and ManiusAcilius Glabrio was substituted in his room. It happened that both thecurule aediles, who had been created at the elections, were personswho could not immediately undertake the office: for Caius CorneliusCethegus was elected in his absence, when he was occupying Spainas his province; and Caius Valerius Flaccus, who was present, beingflamen Dialis, could not take the oath of observing the laws; and noperson was allowed to hold any office longer than five days withouttaking the oath. Flaccus petitioned to be excused from complying withthe law, on which the senate decreed, that if the aedile produced aperson approved of by the consuls, who would take the oath for him,the consuls, if they thought proper, should make application to thetribunes, that it might be proposed to the people. Lucius ValeriusFlaccus, praetor elect, was produced to swear for his brother. Thetribunes proposed to the commons, and the commons ordered that thisshould be as if the aedile himself had sworn. With regard to the otheraedile, likewise, an order of the commons was made. On the tribunesputting the question, what two persons they chose should go and takethe command of the armies in Spain, in order that Caius Cornelius,curule aedile, might come home to execute his office, and that LuciusManlius Acidinus might, after many years, retire from the province;the commons ordered Cneius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Stertinius,proconsuls, to command in Spain."Book 32,Chapter 1,"The consuls and praetors, having entered upon office on the idesof March, cast lots for the provinces. Italy fell to Lucius CorneliusLentulus, Macedonia to Publius Villius. Of the praetors, the cityjurisdiction fell to Lucius Quinctius, Ariminum to Cneius Baebius,Sicily to Lucius Valerius, Sardinia to Lucius Villius. The consulLentulus was ordered to levy new legions; Villius, to receive the armyfrom Publius Sulpicius; and, to complete its number, power was givenhim to raise as many men as he thought proper. To the praetor Baebiuswere decreed the legions which Caius Aurelius, late consul, hadcommanded, with directions that he should keep them in their presentsituation, until the consul should come with the new army to supplytheir place; and that, on his arriving in Gaul, all the soldiers whohad served out their time should be sent home, except five thousandof the allies, which would be sufficient to protect the province roundAriminum. The command was continued to the praetors of the formeryear; to Cneius Sergius, that he might superintend the distribution ofland to the soldiers who had served for many years in Spain, Sicily,and Sardinia; to Quintus Minucius, that he might finish the inquiriesconcerning the conspiracies in Bruttium, which, while praetor, he hadmanaged with care and fidelity. That he should also send to Locri, tosuffer punishment, those who had been convicted of sacrilege, andwho were then in chains at Rome; and that he should take care, thatwhatever had been carried away from the temple of Proserpine should bereplaced with expiations. The Latin festival was repeated in pursuanceof a decree of the pontiffs, because ambassadors from Ardea hadcomplained to the senate, that during the said solemnity they had notbeen supplied with meat as usual on the Alban mount. From Suessa anaccount was brought, that two of the gates, and the wall between them,had been struck with lightning. Messengers from Formiae related, thatthe temple of Jupiter had also been struck by lightning; from Ostia,likewise, news came of the like accident having happened to the templeof Jupiter there; it was said, too, that the temples of Apollo andSancus, at Veliternum, were struck in like manner; and that in thetemple of Hercules, hair had grown (on the statue). A letter wasreceived from Quintus Minucius, propraetor, from Bruttium, that a foalhad been born with five feet, and three chickens with three feeteach. Afterwards a letter was brought from Macedonia, from PubliusSulpicius, proconsul, in which, among other matters, it was mentioned,that a laurel tree had sprung up on the poop of a ship of war. Onoccasion of the former prodigies, the senate had voted, that theconsuls should offer sacrifices with the greater victims to such godsas they thought proper. On account of the last prodigy, alone, thearuspices were called before the senate, and, in pursuance oftheir answer, the people were ordered by proclamation to performa supplication for one day, and worship was solemnized at all theshrines."Book 32,Chapter 2,"This year, the Carthaginians brought to Rome the first paymentof the silver imposed on them as a tribute; and the quaestors havingreported, that it was not of the proper standard, and that, on theassay, it wanted a fourth part, they made up the deficiency with moneyborrowed at Rome. On their requesting that the senate would be pleasedto order their hostages to be restored to them, a hundred weregiven up, and hopes were held out with relation to the rest, if theyremained in fidelity (to the treaty). They then further requested,that the remaining hostages might be removed from Norba, where theywere ill accommodated, to some other place, and they were permittedto remove to Signia and Ferentinum. The request of the people of Gadeswas likewise complied with: that a governor should not be sent totheir city; being contrary to what had been agreed with them by LuciusMarcius Septimus, when they came under the protection of the Romanpeople. Deputies from Narnia, complaining that they had not their duenumber of settlers, and that several who were not of their community,had crept in among them, and were conducting themselves ascolonists, Lucius Cornelius, the consul, was ordered to appoint threecommissioners to adjust those matters. The three appointed were,Publius and Sextus Aelius, both surnamed Paetus, and Caius CorneliusLentulus. The favour granted to the Narnians, of filling up theirnumber of colonists, was refused to the people of Cossa, who appliedfor it."Book 32,Chapter 3,"The consuls, having finished the business that was to be done atRome, set out for their provinces. Publius Villius, on coming intoMacedonia, found the soldiers in a violent mutiny, which hadbeen previously excited, and not sufficiently repressed at thecommencement. They were the two thousand who, after Hannibal had beenvanquished, had been transported from Africa to Sicily, and then,in about a year after, into Macedonia, as volunteers; they denied,however, that this was done with their consent, affirming, that ""theyhad been put on board the ships, by the tribunes, contrary to theirremonstrances; but, in what manner soever they had become engaged inthat service, whether it had been voluntarily undertaken or imposed onthem, the time of it was now expired, and it was reasonable that someend should be put to their warfare. For many years they had not seenItaly, but had grown old under arms in Sicily, Africa, and Macedonia;they were now, in short, worn out with labour and fatigue, and wereexhausted of their blood by the many wounds they had received."" Theconsul told them, that ""the grounds on which they demanded theirdischarge, appeared to him to be reasonable, if the demand had beenmade in a moderate manner; but that neither that, nor any otherground, was a justifying cause of mutiny. Wherefore, if they werecontented to adhere to their standards, and obey orders, he wouldwrite to the senate concerning their release; and that whatthey desired would more easily be obtained by moderation than byturbulence."""Book 32,Chapter 4,"At this time, Philip was pushing on the siege of Thaumaci, with theutmost vigour, by means of mounds and engines, and was ready tobring up the ram to the walls, when he was obliged to relinquish theundertaking by the sudden arrival of the Aetolians, who, under thecommand of Archidamus, having made their way into the town between theposts of the Macedonians, never ceased, day or night, making continualsallies, sometimes against the guards, sometimes against the works ofthe besiegers. They were at the same time favoured by the very natureof the place: for Thaumaci stands near the road from Thermopylae, andthe Malian bay as you go through Lamia, on a lofty eminence, hangingimmediately over the narrow pass which the Thessalians call Caela.[1]After passing through the craggy grounds of Thessaly, the roads arerendered intricate by the windings of the valleys, and on the nearapproach to the city, such an immense plain opens at once to view,like a vast sea, that the eye can scarcely reach the bounds ofthe expanse beneath From this surprising prospect it was calledThaumaci.[2] The city itself is secured, not only by the height of itssituation, but by its standing on a rock, the stone of which had beencut away on all sides. These difficulties, and the prize not appearingsufficient to recompense so much toil and danger, caused Philip todesist from the attempt. The winter also was approaching; he thereforeretired from thence, and led back his troops into winter quarters, inMacedonia."Book 32,Chapter 5,"There, whilst others, glad of any interval of rest, consigned bothbody and mind to repose, Philip, in proportion as the season of theyear had relieved him from the incessant fatigues of marching andfighting, found his care and anxiety increase the more, when he turnedhis thoughts towards the general issue of the war. He dreaded, notonly his enemies, who pressed him hard by land and sea, but also thedispositions, sometimes of his allies, at others of his own subjects,lest the former might be induced, by hopes of friendship with theRomans, to revolt, and the Macedonians themselves be seized with adesire of innovation. Wherefore, he despatched ambassadors to theAchaeans, both to require their oath, (for it had been made an articleof their agreement that they should take an oath prescribed by Philipevery year,) and at the same time to restore to them Orchomenes,Heraea, and Triphylia. To the Eleans he delivered up Aliphera; whichcity, they insisted, had never belonged to Triphylia, but ought to berestored to them, having been one of those that were incorporated bythe council of the Arcadians for the founding of Megalopolis. Thesemeasures had the effect of strengthening his connexion with theAchaeans. The affections of the Macedonians he conciliated by histreatment of Heraclides: for, finding that his having countenancedthis man had been the cause to him of the utmost unpopularity, hecharged him with a number of crimes, and threw him into chains, tothe great joy of the people. It was now, if at any time, that he madepreparations for the war with especial energy. He exercised boththe Macedonian and mercenary troops in arms, and in the beginning ofspring sent Athenagoras, with all the foreign auxiliaries and whatlight-armed troops there were, through Epirus into Chaonia, to seizethe pass at Antigonia, which the Greeks called Stena. He followed, ina few days, with the heavy troops: and having viewed every situationin the country, he judged that the most advantageous post forfortifying himself was on the river Aous. This river runs in a narrowvale, between two mountains, one of which the natives call Aeropus,and the other Asnaus, affording a passage of very little breadth alongthe bank. He ordered Athenagoras, with the light infantry, to takepossession of Asnaus, and to fortify it. His own camp he pitched onAeropus. Those places where the rocks were steep, were defended byguards of a few soldiers only; the less secure he strengthened, somewith trenches, some with ramparts, and others with towers. A greatnumber of engines, also, were disposed in proper places, that, bymeans of weapons thrown from these, they might keep the enemy ata distance. The royal pavilion was pitched on the outside of therampart, on the most conspicuous eminence, in order, by this show ofconfidence, to dishearten the foe, and raise the hopes of his own men."Book 32,Chapter 6,"The consul having received intelligence from Charopus of Epirus,on what pass the king had taken his position with his army, as soonas the spring began to open, left Corcyra, where he had passed thewinter, and, sailing over to the continent, led on his army againstthe enemy. When he came within about five miles of the king's camp,leaving the legions in a strong post, he went forward in person withsome light troops, to view the nature of the country; and, on the dayfollowing, held a council, in order to determine whether he shouldattempt a passage through the defiles occupied by the enemy,notwithstanding the great labour and danger which the proposalinvolved, or lead round his forces by the same road through whichSulpicius had penetrated into Macedonia the year before. Thedeliberations on this question had lasted several days, when newsarrived, that Titus Quinctius had been elected consul; that he hadobtained, by lot, Macedonia as his province; and that, hastening hisjourney, he had already come over to Corcyra. Valerius Antias says,that Villius marched into the defile, and that, as he could notproceed straight forward, because every pass was occupied by the king,he followed the course of a valley, through the middle of which theriver Aous flows, and having hastily constructed a bridge, passed overto the bank where the king's camp was, and fought a battle with him;that the king was routed and driven out of his camp; that twelvethousand of the enemy were killed, and two thousand two hundred taken,together with a hundred and thirty-two military standards, and twohundred and thirty horses. He adds, that, during the battle, a templewas vowed to Jupiter in case of success. The other historians, bothGreek and Latin, (all those at least whose accounts I have read,)affirm that nothing memorable was done by Villius, and that TitusQuinctius, the consul who succeeded him, received from him a war whichhad yet to be commenced."Book 32,Chapter 7,"During the time of these transactions in Macedonia, the otherconsul, Lucius Lentulus, who had stayed at Rome, held an assemblyfor the election of censors. Out of many illustrious men who stoodcandidates, were chosen Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus and PubliusAelius Paetus. These, acting together in perfect harmony, read thelist of the senate, without passing a censure on any one member; theyalso let to farm the port-duties at Capua, and at Puteoli, and of thefort situate were the city now stands; enrolling for this latter placethree hundred colonists, that being the number fixed by the senate;they also sold the lands of Capua, which lie at the foot of MountTifata. About the same time, Lucius Manlius Acidinus, on his returnfrom Spain, was hindered from entering the city in ovation by MarcusPortius Laeca, plebeian tribune, notwithstanding he had obtainedpermission of the senate: coming, then, into the city in a privatecharacter, he conveyed to the treasury one thousand two hundredpounds' weight of silver, and about thirty pounds' weight of gold.During this year, Cneius Baebius Tamphilus, who had succeeded to thegovernment of the province of Gaul, in the room of Caius Aurelius,consul of the year preceding, having, without proper caution, enteredthe territories of the Insubrian Gauls, was surprised with almost thewhole of his army. He lost above six thousand six hundred men,--sogreat a loss was received from a war which had now ceased to be anobject of apprehension. This event called away the consul, LuciusLentulus, from the city; who, arriving in the province, which wasfilled with confusion, and taking the command of the army, which hefound dispirited by its defeat, severely reprimanded the praetor, andordered him to quit the province and return to Rome. Neither did theconsul himself perform any considerable service, being called home topreside at the elections, which were obstructed by Marcus Fulvius andManius Curius, plebeian tribunes, who wished to hinder Titus QuinctiusFlamininus from standing candidate for the consulship, after passingthrough the office of quaestor. They alleged, that ""the aedileship andpraetorship were now held in contempt, and that the nobility did notmake their way to the consulship through the regular gradations ofoffices, thus affording a trial of themselves; but, passing over theintermediate steps, pushed at once from the lowest to the highest.""From a dispute in the Field of Mars, the affair was brought beforethe senate, where it was voted, ""that when a person sued for any post,which by the laws he was permitted to hold, the people had the rightof choosing whoever they thought proper."" To this decision of thesenate the tribunes submitted, and thereupon Sextus Aelius Paetus andTitus Quinctius Flamininus were elected consuls. Then was held theelection of praetors. The persons chosen were, Lucius CorneliusMerula, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, Marcus Porcius Cato, and CaiusHelvius, who had been plebeian aediles. By these the plebeian gameswere repeated, and, on occasion of the games, a feast of Jupiter wascelebrated. The curule aediles, also, Caius Valerius Flaccus, who wasflamen of Jupiter, and Caius Cornelius Cethegus, celebrated the Romangames with great magnificence. Servius and Caius Sulpicius Galba,pontiffs, died this year; in their room were substituted MarcusAemilius Lepidus and Cneius Cornelius Scipio, as pontiffs."Book 32,Chapter 8,"The new consuls, Sextus Aelius Paetus and Titus QuinctiusFlamininus, on assuming the administration, convened the senate inthe Capitol, and the fathers decreed, that ""the consuls should settlebetween themselves or cast lots for the provinces, Macedonia andItaly. That he to whom Macedonia fell should enlist, as a supplementto the legions, three thousand Roman footmen and three hundred horse,and also five thousand footmen and five hundred horsemen belonging tothe Latin confederacy."" The army assigned to the other consul was toconsist entirely of newly-raised men. Lucius Lentulus, consul ofthe preceding year, was continued in command, and was ordered not todepart from the province, nor to remove the old army, until the consulshould arrive with the new legions. The consuls cast lots for theprovinces, and Italy fell to Aelius, Macedonia to Quintius. Ofthe praetors, the lots gave to Lucius Cornelius Merula the cityjurisdiction; to Marcus Claudius, Sicily; to Marcus Porcius, Sardinia;and to Caius Helvius, Gaul. The levying of troops was then begun, forbesides the consular armies, the praetors had been ordered also toenlist men: for Marcellus, in Sicily, four thousand foot and threehundred horse of the Latin confederates; for Cato, in Sardinia, threethousand foot and two hundred horse of the same class of soldiers;with directions, that both these praetors, on their arrival in theirprovinces, should disband the veterans, both foot and horse. Theconsuls then introduced to the senate ambassadors from king Attalus.These, after representing that their king gave every assistance to theRoman arms on land and sea, with his fleet and all his forces, andhad up to that day executed with zeal and obedience every order ofthe consuls, added, that ""they feared it would not be in his power tocontinue so to do by reason of king Antiochus, for that Antiochus hadinvaded the kingdom of Attalus, when destitute of protective forcesby sea and land. That Attalus, therefore, entreated the conscriptfathers, if they chose to employ his army and navy in the Macedonianwar, then to send a body of forces to protect his territories; or ifthat were not agreeable, to allow him to go home to defend his ownpossessions, with his fleet and troops."" The following answer wasordered to be given to the ambassadors: that ""it was a cause ofgratitude to the senate that Attalus had assisted the Roman commanderswith his fleet and other forces. That they would neither send succoursto Attalus, against Antiochus, the ally and friend of the Romanpeople; nor would they detain the auxiliary troops longer than wouldbe convenient to the king. That it was ever a constant rule with theRoman people, to use the aid of others so far only as was agreeable tothe will of those who gave it; and even to leave the commencement andthe termination of that aid at the discretion of those who desiredthat the Romans should be benefited by their help. That they wouldsend ambassadors to Antiochus, to represent to him, that Attalus, withhis fleet and army, were, at the present, employed by the Roman peopleagainst Philip, their common enemy; and that Antiochus would do thatwhich was gratifying to the senate if he abstained from the kingdom ofAttalus and desisted from the war; for that it was much to be wished,that kings who were allies and friends to the Roman people shouldmaintain friendship between themselves also."""Book 32,Chapter 9,"When the consul Titus Quinctius had finished the levies, in makingwhich he chose principally such as had served in Spain or Africa, thatis, soldiers of approved courage, and when hastening to set forwardto his province, he was delayed by reports of prodigies, and theexpiations of them. There had been struck by lightning the publicroad at Veii, a temple of Jupiter at Lanuvium, a temple of Herculesat Ardea, with a wall and towers at Capua, also the edifice which iscalled Alba. At Arretium, the sky appeared as on fire; at Velitrae,the earth, to the extent of three acres, sunk down so as to form avast chasm. From Suessa Aurunca, an account was brought of a lambborn with two heads; from Sinuessa, of a swine with a human head. Onoccasion of these ill omens, a supplication of one day's continuancewas performed; the consuls gave their attention to divine services,and, as soon as the gods were appeased, set out for their provinces.Aelius, accompanied by Caius Helvius, praetor, went into Gaul, wherehe put under the command of the praetor the army which he receivedfrom Lucius Lentulus, and which he ought to have disbanded, intendingto carry on his own operations with the new troops, which he hadbrought with him; but he effected nothing worth recording. The otherconsul, Titus Quinctius, setting sail from Brundusium earlier than hadbeen usual with former consuls, reached Corcyra, with, eight thousandfoot and eight hundred horse. From this place, he passed over, in aquinquereme, to the nearest part of Epirus, and proceeded, by longjourneys, to the Roman camp. Here, having dismissed Villius, andwaiting a few days, until the forces from Corcyra should come up andjoin him, he held a council, to determine whether he should endeavourto force his way straight forward through the camp of the enemy; orwhether, without attempting an enterprise of so great difficulty anddanger, he should not rather take a circuitous and safe road, so as topenetrate into Macedonia by the country of the Dassaretians and Lycus.The latter plan would have been adopted, had he not feared that, inremoving to a greater distance from the sea, the enemy might slip outof his hands; and that if the king should resolve to secure himself inthe woods and wilds, as he had done before, the summer might be spunout without any thing being effected. It was therefore determined, bethe event what it might, to attack the enemy in their present post,disadvantageous as it was. But they more easily resolved on thismeasure, than devised any safe or certain method of accomplishing it."Book 32,Chapter 10,"Forty days were passed in view of the enemy, without making anykind of effort. Hence Philip conceived hopes of bringing about atreaty of peace, through the mediation of the people of Epirus; and acouncil, which was held for the purpose, having appointed Pausanias,the praetor, and Alexander, the master of the horse, as negotiators,they brought the consul and the king to a conference, on the banksof the river Aous, where the channel was narrowest. The sum of theconsul's demands was, that the king should withdraw his troops fromthe territories of the several states; that, to those whose lands andcities he had plundered, he should restore such of their effects ascould be found; and that the value of the rest should be estimated bya fair arbitration. Philip answered, that ""the cases of the severalstates differed widely from each other. That such as he himself hadseized on, he would set at liberty; but he would not divest himselfof the hereditary and just possessions which had been conveyed downto him from his ancestors. If those states, with whom hostilities hadbeen carried on, complained of any losses in the war, he was readyto submit the matter to the arbitration of any state with whom bothparties were at peace."" To this the consul replied, that ""the businessrequired neither judge nor arbitrator: for to whom was it not evidentthat every injurious consequence of the war was to be imputed to himwho first took up arms. And in this case Philip, unprovoked by any,had first commenced hostilities against all."" When they next beganto treat of those nations which were to be set at liberty, theconsul named, first, the Thessalians: on which the king, fired withindignation, exclaimed, ""What harsher terms, Titus Quinctius, couldyou impose on me if I were vanquished?"" With these words he retiredhastily from the conference, and they were with difficulty restrainedby the river which separated them from assaulting each other withmissile weapons. On the following day many skirmishes took placebetween parties sallying from the outposts, in a plain sufficientlywide for the purpose. Afterwards the king's troops drew back intonarrow and rocky places, whither the Romans, keenly eager forfighting, penetrated also. These had in their favour order andmilitary discipline, while their arms were of a kind well calculatedfor protecting their persons. In favour of the enemy were theadvantage of ground, and their balistas and catapultas disposed onalmost every rock as on walls. After many wounds given and receivedon both sides, and numbers being slain, as in a regular engagement,darkness put an end to the fight."Book 32,Chapter 11,"While matters were in this state, a herdsman, sent by Charopus,prince of the Epirots, was brought to the consul. He said, that ""beingaccustomed to feed his herd in the forest, then occupied by the king'scamp, he knew every winding and path in the neighbouring mountains;and that if the consul thought proper to send some troops with him, hewould lead them by a road, neither dangerous nor difficult, to a spotover the enemy's head."" When the consul heard these things, he sent toCharopus to inquire if he considered that confidence might be placedin the rustic in so important a matter. Charopus ordered an answerto be returned, that he should give just so much credit to this man'saccount, as should still leave every thing rather in his own powerthan in that of the other. Though the consul rather wished thandared to give the intelligence full belief, and though his mind waspossessed by mingled emotions of joy and fear, yet being moved by theconfidence due to Charopus, he resolved to put to trial the prospectthat was held out to him. In order to prevent all suspicion of thematter, during the two following days he carried on attacks againstthe enemy without intermission, drawing out troops against them inevery quarter, and sending up fresh men to relieve the wearied. Then,selecting four thousand foot and three hundred horse, he put themunder the command of a military tribune, with directions to advancethe horse as far as the nature of the ground allowed; and when theycame to places impassable to cavalry, then to post them in some plain;that the infantry should proceed by the road which the guide wouldshow, and that when, according to his promise, they arrived on theheight over the enemy's head, then they should give a signal by smoke,but raise no shout, until the tribune should have reason to thinkthat, in consequence of the signal received from him, the battle wasbegun. He ordered that the march should take place by night, (the moonshining through the whole of it,) and employ the day in taking foodand rest. The most liberal promises were made to the guide, providedhe fulfilled his engagement; he bound him, nevertheless, and deliveredhim to the tribune. Having thus sent off this detachment, the Romangeneral exerted himself only the more vigorously in every part to makehimself master of the posts of the enemy."Book 32,Chapter 12,"On the third day, the Roman party made the signal by smoke, tonotify that they had gained possession of the eminence to which theyhad been directed; and then the consul, dividing his forces into threeparts, marched up with the main strength of his army, through a valleyin the middle, and made the wings on right and left advance tothe camp of the enemy. Nor did these advance to meet him with lessalacrity. The Roman soldiers, in the ardour of their courage, longmaintained the fight on the outside of their works, for they had nosmall superiority in bravery, in skill, and in the nature of theirarms; but when the king's troops, after many of them were woundedand slain, retreated into places secured either by intrenchments orsituation, the danger reverted on the Romans, who pushed forward,inconsiderately, into disadvantageous grounds and defiles, outof which a retreat was difficult. Nor would they have extricatedthemselves without suffering for their rashness, had not theMacedonians, first, by a shout heard in their rear, and then by anattack begun on that quarter, been utterly dismayed and confounded atthe unforeseen danger. Some betook themselves to a hasty flight: some,keeping their stand, rather because they could find no way for flightthan that they possessed spirit to support the engagement, were cutoff by the Romans, who pressed them hard both on front and rear. Theirwhole army might have been destroyed, had the victors continued theirpursuit of the fugitives; but the cavalry were obstructed by thenarrowness of the passes and the ruggedness of the ground; and theinfantry, by the weight of their armour. The king at first fled withprecipitation, and without looking behind him; but afterwards, whenhe had proceeded as far as five miles, he began, from recollecting theunevenness of the road, to suspect, (what was really the case,)that the enemy could not follow him; and halting, he despatched hisattendants through all the hills and valleys to collect the stragglerstogether. His loss was not more than two thousand men. The rest of hisarmy, coming to one spot, as if they had followed some signal, marchedoff, in a compact body, towards Thessaly. The Romans, after havingpursued the enemy as far as they could with safety, killing such asthey overtook, and despoiling the slain, seized and plundered theking's camp; which, even when it had no defenders, was difficultof access. The following night they were lodged within their owntrenches."Book 32,Chapter 13,"Next day, the consul pursued the enemy through the same defilesthrough which the river winds its way among the valleys. The kingcame on the first day to the camp of Pyrrhus, a place so called inTriphylia, a district of Melotis; and on the following day he reachedMount Lingos, an immense march for his army, but his fear impelledhim. This ridge of mountains belongs to Epirus, and stretches alongbetween Macedonia and Thessaly; the side next to Thessaly faces theeast, that next to Macedonia the north. These hills are thicklyclad with woods, and on their summits have open plains and perennialstreams. Here Philip remained encamped for several days, being unableto determine whether he should continue his retreat until he arrivedin his own dominions, or whether he might venture back into Thessaly.At length, his decision leaned to leading down his army into Thessaly;and, going by the shortest roads to Tricca, he made hasty excursionsfrom thence to all the cities within his reach. The inhabitants whowere able to accompany him he summoned from their habitations, andburned the towns, allowing the owners to take with them such of theireffects as they were able to carry; the rest became the prey of thesoldiers; nor was there any kind of cruelty which they could havesuffered from an enemy, that they did not suffer from these theirconfederates. These acts were painful to Philip even while he executedthem; but as the country was soon to become the property of the foe,he wished to rescue out of it at least the persons of his allies. Inthis manner were ravaged the towns of Phacium, Iresiae, Euhydrium,Eretria, and Palaepharsalus. On his coming to Pherae, the gates wereshut against him, and as it would necessarily occasion a considerabledelay if he attempted to take it by force, and as he could not sparetime, he dropped the design, and crossed over the mountains intoMacedonia; for he had received intelligence, that the Aetolians toowere marching towards him. These, on hearing of the battle fought onthe banks of the river of Aous, first laid waste the nearest tractsround Sperchia, and Long Come, as they call it, and then, passingover into Thessaly, got possession of Cymine and Angeae at the firstassault. From Metropolis they were repulsed by the inhabitants, who,while a part of their army was plundering the country, assembled in abody to defend the city. Afterwards, making an attempt on Callithera,they were attacked by the townsmen in a like manner; but withstoodtheir onset with more steadiness, drove back into the town the partywhich had sallied, and content with that success, as they had noprospect whatever of taking the place by storm, retired. They thentook by assault and sacked the towns of Theuma and Calathas. Acharraethey gained by surrender. Xyniae, through similar apprehensions, wasabandoned by the inhabitants. These having forsaken their homes, andgoing together in a body, fell in with a party which was being marchedto Thaumacus for the purpose of protecting their foragers; all ofwhom, an irregular and unarmed multitude, incapable of any resistance,were put to the sword by the troops. The deserted town of Xyniaewas plundered. The Aetolians then took Cyphara, a fort convenientlysituated on the confines of Dolopia. All this the Aetolians performedwithin the space of a few days."Book 32,Chapter 14,"Nor did Amynander and the Athamanians, when they heard of thevictory obtained by the Romans, continue inactive. Amynander, havinglittle confidence in his own troops, requested a slight auxiliaryforce from the consul; and then advancing towards Gomphi, he stormedon his march a place called Pheca, situate between that town and thenarrow pass which separates Thessaly from Athamania. He then attackedGomphi, and though the inhabitants defended it for several days withthe utmost vigour, yet, as soon as he had raised the scaling laddersto the walls, the same apprehension (which had operated on others) atlength compelled them to surrender. This capture of Gomphi spreadthe greatest consternation among the Thessalians: their fortresses ofArgenta, Pherinus, Thimarus, Lisinae, Stimon, and Lampsussurrendered, one after another, with several other garrisons equallyinconsiderable. While the Athamanians and Aetolians, delivered fromfear of the Macedonians, converted to their own profit the fruits ofanother's victory; and Thessaly, ravaged by three armies at once, knewnot which to believe its foe or its friend; the consul marched on,through the pass which the enemy's flight had left open, into thecountry of Epirus. Though he well knew which party the Epirots,excepting their prince Charopus, were disposed to favour, yet as hesaw that, even from the motive of atoning for past behaviour, theyobeyed his orders with diligence, he regulated his treatment of themby the standard of their present rather than of their former temper,and by this readiness to pardon conciliated their affection for thefuture. Then, sending orders to Corcyra for the transport ships tocome into the Ambrician bay, he advanced by moderate marches, and onthe fourth day pitched his camp on Mount Cercetius. Hither he orderedAmynander to come with his auxiliary troops; not so much as beingin want of his forces, as that he might avail himself of them as hisguides into Thessaly. With the same purpose, many volunteers of theEpirots also were admitted into the corps of auxiliaries."Book 32,Chapter 15,"Of the cities of Thessaly, the first which he attacked wasPhaloria. The garrison here consisted of two thousand Macedonians,who at first resisted with the utmost vigour so far as their arms andfortifications could protect them. The assault was carried on withoutintermission or relaxation either by day or by night, because theconsul thought that it would have a powerful effect on the spirits ofthe rest of the Thessalians, if the first who made trial of theRoman strength were unable to withstand it; and this at the sametime subdued the obstinacy of the Macedonians. On the reduction ofPhaloria, deputies came from Metropolis and Piera, surrendering thosecities. To them, on their petition, pardon was granted: Phaloria wassacked, and burned. He then proceeded to Aeginium; but finding thisplace so circumstanced, that, even with a moderate garrison, it wassafe, after discharging a few weapons against the nearest advancedguard he directed his march towards the territory of Gomphi; andthence descended into the plains of Thessaly. His army was now in wantof every thing, because he had spared the lands of the Epirots; hetherefore despatched messengers to learn whether the transports hadreached Leucas and the Ambracian bay; sending the cohorts, in turn,to Ambracia for corn. Now, the road from Gomphi to Ambracia, althoughdifficult and embarrassed, is very short; so that in a few days,provisions having been conveyed from the sea, his camp was filled withan abundant supply of all necessaries. He then marched to Atrax, whichis about ten miles from Larissa, on the river Peneus. The inhabitantscame originally from Perrhaebia. The Thessalians, here, were notin the least alarmed at the first coming of the Romans; and Philip,although he durst not himself advance into Thessaly, yet, keeping hisstationary camp in the vale of Tempe, whenever any place was attemptedby the enemy, he sent up reinforcements as occasion required."Book 32,Chapter 16,"About the time that Quinctius first pitched his camp opposite toPhilip's, at the entrance of Epirus, Lucius, the consul's brother,whom the senate had commissioned both to the naval command and to thegovernment of the coast, sailed over with two quinqueremes to Corcyra;and when he learned that the fleet had departed thence, thinking thatno delay ought to be incurred, he followed, and overtook it at theisland of Zama. Here he dismissed Lucius Apustius, in whose room hehad been appointed, and then proceeded to Malea, but at a slow rate,being obliged, for the most part, to tow the vessels which accompaniedhim with provisions. From Malea, after ordering the rest to followwith all possible expedition, himself, with three light quinqueremes,hastened forward to the Piraeus, and took under his command the shipsleft there by Lucius Apustius, lieutenant-general, for the protectionof Athens. At the same time, two fleets set sail from Asia; one oftwenty-four quinqueremes, under king Attalus; the other belongingto the Rhodians, consisting of twenty decked ships, and commanded byAgesimbrotus. These fleets, joining near the island of Andros, sailedfor Euboea, which was separated from them only by a narrow strait.They first ravaged the lands belonging to Carystus; but, judging thatcity too strong, in consequence of a reinforcement hastily sent fromChalcis, they bent their course to Eretria. Lucius Quinctius also, onhearing of the arrival of king Attalus, came thither with the shipswhich had lain at the Piraeus; having left orders, that his own shipsshould, as they arrived, follow him to Euboea. The siege of Eretriawas now pushed forward with the utmost vigour; for the three combinedfleets carried machines and engines, of all sorts, for the demolitionof towns, and the adjacent country offered abundance of timber forthe construction of new works. At the beginning the townsmen defendedtheir walls with a good degree of spirit; afterwards, when they feltthe effects of fatigue, a great many being likewise wounded, and apart of the wall demolished by the enemy's works, they became disposedto capitulate. But they had a garrison of Macedonians, of whom theystood in no less dread than of the Romans; and Philocles, the king'sgeneral, sent frequent messages from Chalcis, that he would bring themsuccour in due time, if they could hold out the siege. The hope ofthis, in conjunction with their fears, obliged them to protract thetime longer than was consistent either with their wishes or theirstrength. However, having learned soon after that Philocles had beenrepulsed in the attempt, and forced to fly back, in disorder, toChalcis, they instantly sent deputies to Attalus, to beg pardon andprotection. While intent on the prospect of peace, they executed withless energy the duties of war, and kept armed guards in that quarteronly where the breach had been made in the wall, neglecting all therest; Quinctius made an assault by night on the side where itwas least apprehended, and carried the town by scalade. The wholemultitude of the townsmen, with their wives and children, fled intothe citadel, but soon after surrendered themselves prisoners. Thequantity of money, of gold and silver, taken was not great. Of statuesand pictures, the works of ancient artists, and other ornaments ofthat kind, a greater number was found than was proportionate either tothe size of the city, or its opulence in other particulars."Book 32,Chapter 17,"The design on Carystus was then resumed, and the fleets sailedthither; on which the whole body of the inhabitants, before the troopswere disembarked, deserted the city and fled into the citadel, whencethey sent deputies to beg protection from the Roman general. To thetownspeople life and liberty were immediately granted; and it wasordered, that the Macedonians should pay a ransom of three hundreddrachmas[1] a head, deliver up their arms, and quit the country. Afterbeing ransomed for the said amount, they were transported, unarmed, toBoeotia. The combined fleets having, in the space of a few days,taken these two important cities of Euboea, sailed round Sunium, apromontory of Attica, and steered their course to Cenchreae, the grandmart of the Corinthians. In the mean time, the consul found the siegeof Atrax more tedious and severe than had been universally expected,and the enemy resisted in the way which they had least anticipated. Hehad supposed that the whole of the trouble would be in demolishing thewall, and that if he could once open a passage for his soldiers intothe city, the consequence would then be, the flight and slaughter ofthe enemy, as usually happens on the capture of towns. But when, on abreach being made in the wall by the rams, and when the soldiers, bymounting over the ruins, had entered the place, this proved onlythe beginning, as it were, of an unusual and fresh labour. For theMacedonians in garrison, who were both chosen men and many in number,supposing that they would be entitled to extraordinary honour if theyshould maintain the defence of the city by means of arms and courage,rather than by the help of walls, formed themselves in a compact body,strengthening their line by an uncommon number of files in depth.These, when they saw the Romans entering by the breaches, drovethem back, so that they were entangled among the rubbish, andwith difficulty could effect a retreat. This gave the consul greatuneasiness; for he considered such a disgrace, not merely as itretarded the reduction of a single city, but as likely to affectmaterially the whole process of the war, which in general depends muchon the influence of events in themselves unimportant. Having thereforecleared the ground, which was heaped up with the rubbish of thehalf-ruined wall, he brought up a tower of extraordinary height,consisting of many stories, and which carried a great number ofsoldiers. He likewise sent up the cohorts in strong bodies one afteranother, to force their way, if possible, through the wedge of theMacedonians, which is called a phalanx. But in such a confined space,(for the wall was thrown down to no great extent,) the enemy had theadvantage, both in the kind of weapons which they used, and in themanner of fighting. When the Macedonians, in close array, stretchedout before them their long spears against the target fence which wasformed by the close position of their antagonists' shields, and whenthe Romans, after discharging their javelins without effect, drewtheir swords, these could neither press on to a closer combat, nor cutoff the heads of the spears; and if they did cut or break off any,the shaft, being sharp at the part where it was broken, filled upits place among the points of those which were unbroken, in a kind ofpalisade. Besides this, the parts of the wall still standing renderedboth the flanks of the Macedonians secure, who were not obliged,either in retreating or in advancing to an attack, to pass througha long space, which generally occasions disorder in the ranks. Anaccidental circumstance also helped to confirm their courage: for asthe tower was moved along a bank of not sufficiently solid soil, oneof the wheels sinking into a rut, made the tower lean in such a mannerthat it appeared to the enemy as if falling, and threw the soldiersposted on it into consternation and affright."Book 32,Chapter 18,"As none of his attempts met any success, the consul was veryunwilling to allow such a comparison to be exhibited between the twoclasses of soldiery and their respective weapons; at the same time, hecould neither see any prospect of reducing the place speedily, nor anymeans of subsisting in winter, at such a distance from the sea, andin regions desolated by the calamities of war. He therefore raised thesiege; and as, along the whole coast of Acarnania and Aetolia, therewas no port capable of containing all the transports that broughtsupplies to the army, nor any place which afforded lodgings to thelegions, he pitched on Anticyra, in Phocis on the Corinthian gulf, asmost commodiously situated for his purpose. There the legions wouldbe at no great distance from Thessaly, and the places belonging tothe enemy; while they would have in front Peloponnesus, separated fromthem by a narrow sea; on their rear, Aetolia and Acarnania; and ontheir sides, Locris and Boeotia. Phanotea in Phocis he took withoutresistance at the first assault. The siege of Anticyra gave him notmuch delay. Then Ambrysus and Hyampolis were taken. Daulis, beingsituated on a lofty eminence, could not be reduced either by scaladeor works: he therefore provoked the garrison, by missile weapons, tomake sallies from out the town. Then by flying at one time, pursuingat another, and engaging in slight skirmishes, he led them into such adegree of carelessness, and such a contempt of him, that at length theRomans, mixing with them as they ran back, entered by the gates,and stormed the town. Six other fortresses in Phocis, of littleconsequence, came into his hands, through fear rather than by force ofarms. Elatia shut its gates, and the inhabitants seemed determinednot to admit within their walls either the army or the general of theRomans, unless compelled by force."Book 32,Chapter 19,"While the consul was employed in the siege of Elatia, a prospectopened to him of effecting a business of much more importance; namely,of drawing away the Achaeans from their alliance with Philip to thatof the Romans. Cycliades, the head of the faction that favoured theinterest of Philip, they had now banished; and Aristaenus, who wishedfor a union between his countrymen and the Romans, was praetor. TheRoman fleet, with Attalus and the Rhodians, lay at Cenchreae, and werepreparing to lay siege to Corinth with their whole combined force. Theconsul therefore judged it prudent, that, before they entered onthat affair, ambassadors should be sent to the Achaean state, withassurances, that if they came over from the king to the side of theRomans, the latter would consign Corinth to them, and annex it tothe old confederacy of their nation. Accordingly, by the consul'sdirection, ambassadors were sent to the Achaeans, by his brotherLucius Quinctius, by Attalus, and by the Rhodians and Athenians--ageneral assembly being summoned to meet at Sicyon to give themaudience. Now, the state of feeling of the Achaeans was by no meansuniform. Nabis the Lacedaemonian, their constant and inveterate enemy,was the object of their dread; they dreaded the arms of the Romans;they were under obligations to the Macedonians, for services bothof ancient and recent date; but the king himself, on account of hisperfidy and cruelty, they looked upon with jealous fear, and notjudging from the behaviour which he then assumed for the time, theyknew that, on the conclusion of the war, they should find him a moretyrannical master. So that every one of them was not only at a losswhat opinion he should support in the senate of his own particularstate, or in the general diets of the nation; but, even when theydeliberated within themselves, they could not, with any certainty,determine what they ought to wish, or what to prefer. Such was theunsettled state of mind of the members of the assembly, when theambassadors were introduced and liberty of speaking afforded them. TheRoman ambassador, Lucius Calpurnius, spoke first; next the ambassadorsof king Attalus; after them those of the Rhodians; and then Philip's.The Athenians were heard the last, that they might refute thediscourses of the Macedonians. These inveighed against the king withthe greatest acrimony of any, for no others had suffered from him somany and so severe hardships. So great a number of speeches of theambassadors succeeding each other took up the whole of the day; andabout sun-set the council was adjourned."Book 32,Chapter 20,"Next day the council was convened again; and when the magistrates,according to the custom of the Greeks, gave leave, by their herald,to any person who chose to offer advice, not one stood forth; but theysat a long time, looking on each other in silence. It was no wonderthat men, revolving in their minds matters of such contradictorynatures, and who found themselves puzzled and confounded, should beinvolved in additional perplexity by the speeches continued throughthe whole preceding day; in which the difficulties, on all sides,were brought into view, and stated in their full force. At lengthAristaenus, the praetor of the Achaeans, not to dismiss the councilwithout any business being introduced, said:--""Achaeans, where arenow those violent disputes, in which, at your feasts and meetings,whenever mention was made of Philip and the Romans, you scarcelyrefrained from blows? Now, in a general assembly, summoned on thatsingle business, when you have heard the arguments of the ambassadorson both sides, when the magistrates demand your opinions, when theherald calls you to declare your sentiments, you are struck dumb.Although your concern for the common safety be insufficient fordetermining the matter, cannot the party zeal which has attached youto one side or the other extort a word from any one of you? especiallywhen none is so obtuse as not to perceive, that the time for declaringand recommending what each either wishes or thinks most advisable,must be at the present moment; that is, before we make any decree.When a decree shall have been once passed, every man even such aspreviously may have disapproved the measure, must then support itas good and salutary."" These persuasions of the praetor, so far fromprevailing on any one person to declare his opinion, did not excite,in all that numerous assembly, collected out of so many states, somuch as a murmur or a whisper."Book 32,Chapter 21,"Then the praetor, Aristaenus, again spoke as follows:--""Chiefs ofAchaea, you are not more at a loss for advice, than you are for words;but every one is unwilling to promote the interest of the public ata risk of danger to himself. Were I in a private character, perhaps Itoo should be silent; but, as praetor, it is my duty to declare, thatI see evidently, either that an audience of the council ought not tohave been accorded to the ambassadors, or that they ought not tobe dismissed from it without an answer. Yet how can I give them ananswer, unless by a decree of yours? And, since not one of you whohave been called to this assembly either chooses or dares to makeknown his sentiments, let us examine (as if they were opinionsproposed to our consideration) the speeches of the ambassadorsdelivered yesterday; supposing the speakers not to have required whatwas useful to themselves, but to have recommended what they thoughtmost conducive to our advantage. The Romans, the Rhodians and Attalus,request an alliance and friendship with us; and they demand to beassisted by us in the war in which they are now engaged againstPhilip. Philip reminds us of our league with him, and of theobligation of our oath; he requires only, that we declare ourselves onhis side; and says, he will be satisfied if we do not intermeddle inthe operations of the war. Does not the reason occur to the mind ofany one of you why those, who are not yet our allies, require morethan he who is? This arises not from modesty in Philip, nor fromthe want of it in the Romans. It is fortune, which, while it bestowsconfidence to requisitions on one side, precludes it on the other. Wesee nothing belonging to Philip but his ambassador: the Roman fleetlies at Cenchreae, exhibiting to our view the spoils of the citiesof Euboea. We behold the consul and his legions, at the distance of asmall tract of sea, overrunning Phocis and Locris. You were surprisedat Philip's ambassador, Cleomedon, showing such diffidence yesterdayin his application to us to take arms on the side of the king againstthe Romans. But if we, in pursuance of the same treaty and oath, thesacredness of which he inculcated on us, were to ask of him, thatPhilip should protect us, both from Nabis and his Lacedaemonians, andalso from the Romans, he would be utterly unable to find, not only aforce with which to protect us, but even an answer to return. As muchso in truth as was Philip himself, who endeavoured, by promises ofwaging war against Nabis, to draw away our youth into Euboea; butfinding that we would neither decree such assistance to him, norchoose to be embroiled in a war with Rome, forgot that allianceon which he now lays such stress, and left us to Nabis and theLacedaemonians to be spoiled and plundered. Besides, to me thearguments of Cleomedon appeared utterly inconsistent. He made light ofthe war with the Romans; and asserted, that the issue of it would besimilar to that of the former, which they waged against Philip. Ifsuch the case, why does he, at a distance, solicit our assistance;rather than come hither in person, and defend us, his old allies, bothfrom Nabis and from the Romans? Us, do I say? Why, on this showing,has he suffered Eretria and Carystus to be taken? Why so many citiesof Thessaly? Why Locris and Phocis? Why does he at present sufferElatia to be besieged? Did he, either through compulsion, or fear, orchoice, quit the straits of Epirus, and those impregnable fastnesseson the river Aous; and why, abandoning the pass which he wasoccupying, did he retire altogether into his own kingdom? If of hisown will he gave up so many allies to the ravages of the enemy, whatobjection can he make to these allies consulting for their own safety?If through fear, he ought to pardon the like fear in us. If he retireddefeated by force of arms, let me ask you, Cleomedon, shall we,Achaeans, be able to withstand the Roman arms, which you, Macedonians,have not withstood? Are we to give credit to your assertion, that theRomans do not employ, in the present war, greater forces or greaterstrength than they did in the former, rather than regard the factsthemselves? In the first instance, they aided the Aetolians with afleet; they sent not to the war either a consul as commander, or aconsular army. The maritime cities of Philip's allies were in terrorand confusion; but the inland places were so secure against the Romanarms, that Philip ravaged the country of the Aetolians, while they invain implored succour from those arms. Whereas, in the present case,the Romans, after bringing to a final conclusion the Punic war, whichthey had supported for sixteen years in the bowels, as it were, ofItaly, sent not auxiliaries to the Aetolians in their quarrels, but,being themselves principals, made a hostile invasion on Macedonia withland and sea forces at once. Their third consul is now pushing forwardthe war with the utmost vigour. Sulpicius, engaging the king withinthe territory of Macedonia itself, has overthrown and put him toflight; and afterwards despoiled the most opulent part of his kingdom.Then, again, when he was in possession of the strait of Epirus, where,from the nature of the ground, his fortifications, and the strengthof his army, he thought himself secure, Quinctius drove him out of hiscamp; pursued him, as he fled into Thessaly; and, almost in the viewof Philip himself, stormed the royal garrisons and the cities ofhis allies. Supposing that there were no truth in what the Athenianambassadors mentioned yesterday, respecting the cruelty, avarice, andlust of the king; supposing the crimes committed, in the country ofAttica, against the gods, celestial and infernal, concerned us notall; that we had less to complain of than what the people of Cius andAbydos, who are far distant from us, have endured: let us then, ifyou please, forget even our own wounds; let the murders and ravagescommitted at Messana, and in the heart of Peloponnesus, the killing ofhis host Garitenes at Cyparissia, almost in the very midst of a feast,in contempt of laws divine and human; the murder of the two Aratusesof Sicyon, father and son, though he was wont to call the unfortunateold man his parent; his carrying away the son's wife into Macedoniafor the gratification of his vicious appetites, and all his violationsof virgins and matrons;--let all these, I say, be consigned tooblivion. Let us suppose our business were not with Philip, throughdread of whose cruelty you are all thus struck dumb; for what othercause could keep you silent, when you have been summoned to a council?Let us imagine that we are treating with Antigonus, a prince of thegreatest mildness and equity, to whose kindness we have all beenhighly indebted; would he require us to perform what at the time wasimpossible? Peloponnesus is a peninsula, united to the continent bythe narrow passage of an isthmus particularly exposed and open to theattacks of naval armaments. Now, if a hundred decked ships, and fiftylighter open ones, and thirty Issean barks, shall begin to lay wasteour coasts, and attack the cities which stand exposed, almost on thevery shore, shall we then retreat into the inland towns, as if we werenot afflicted with an intestine war, though in truth it is ranklingin our very bowels? When Nabis and the Lacedaemonians by land, and theRoman fleet by sea, shall press us, whence must I implore the supportdue from the king's alliance, whence the succours of the Macedonians?Shall we ourselves, with our own arms, defend, against the Romanforces, the cities that will be attacked? Truly, in the former war,we defended Dymae excellently well! The calamities of others affordus abundant examples; let us not seek how we may render ourselves anexample to others. Do not, because the Romans voluntarily desire yourfriendship, contemn that which you ought to have prayed for, nay,laboured with all your might to obtain. But, it is insinuated, thatthey are impelled by fear, in a country to which they are strangers;and that, wishing to shelter themselves under your assistance, theyhave recourse to your alliance in the hope of being admitted into yourharbours, and of there finding supplies of provisions. Now, at seathey are absolute masters; and instantly reduce to subjection everyplace at which they land. What they request, they have power toenforce. Because they wish to treat you with tenderness they do notallow you to take steps that must lead you to ruin. Cleomedon latelypointed out, as the middle and safest way, to remain inactive, andabstain from taking up arms But that is not a middle way; it is no wayat all. For, besides the necessity of either embracing or rejectingthe Roman alliance, what other consequence can ensue from suchconduct, than that, while we show no steady attachment to eitherside, as if we waited the event with design to adapt our counsels tofortune, we shall become the prey of the conqueror? Contemn not then,when it is spontaneously offered to your acceptance, what you ought tohave solicited with your warmest prayers. The free option betweenthe two, which you have this day, you will not always have. The sameopportunity will not last long, nor will it frequently recur. You havelong wished to deliver yourselves out of the hands of Philip, althoughyou have not dared to make the attempt. Those have now crossed thesea, with large fleets and armies, who are able to rescue you to astate of freedom, without any trouble or danger to yourselves. If youreject such persons as allies, you can scarcely be of sane mind; butyou must unavoidably have to deal with them, either as allies or asenemies."""Book 32,Chapter 22,"This speech of the praetor was followed by a general murmur; somedeclaring their approbation, and others vehemently rebuking those whodid so. And now, not only individuals, but whole states were engagedin altercation among themselves; and at length among the magistrates,called Demiurgi, who are ten in number, the dispute was taken up withas much warmth as among the multitude. Five of them declared, thatthey would propose the question concerning an alliance with Rome,and would take the votes on it; while five insisted, that it had beenprovided by law that neither the magistrates should have power topropose nor the council to pass any decree injurious to the alliancewith Philip. This day, also, was spent in contention, and thereremained now but one day more of the regular time of sitting; for,according to the rule, the decree must be passed on the third day: andas that approached, the zeal of the parties was kindled into such aflame, that scarcely did parents refrain from offering violence totheir own sons. There was present a man of Pallene, named Rhisiasus,whose son, Memnon, was a demiurgus, and was of that party whichopposed the reading of the decree and taking the votes. This man, fora long time, entreated his son to allow the Achaeans to take propermeasures for their common safety, and not, by his obstinacy, to bringruin on the whole nation; but, finding that his entreaties had noeffect, he swore that he would treat him, not as a son, but as anenemy, and would put him to death with his own hand. By these threatshe forced him, next day, to join the party that voted for the questionbeing proposed. These, having now become the majority, proposed thequestion accordingly, while almost every one of the states, openlyapproving the measure, showed plainly on which side they would vote.Whereupon the Dymaeans, Megalopolitans, with several of the Argives,rose up, and withdrew from the council; which step excited neitherwonder nor disapprobation. For when, in the memory of theirgrandfathers, the Megalopolitans had been expelled their country bythe Lacedaemonians, Antigonus had reinstated them in their nativeresidence; and, at a later period, when Dymae was taken and sacked bythe Roman troops, Philip ordered that the inhabitants, wherever theywere in servitude, should be ransomed, and not only restored them totheir liberty, but their country. As to the Argives, besides believingthat the royal family of Macedonia derived its origin from them, thegreater part were attached to Philip by personal acts of kindnessand familiar friendship. For these reasons, when the council appeareddisposed to order an alliance to be concluded with Rome, theywithdrew; and their secession was readily excused, in consideration ofthe many and recent obligations by which they were bound to the kingof Macedon."Book 32,Chapter 23,"The rest of the Achaean states, on their opinions being demanded,ratified, by an immediate decree, the alliance with Attalus and theRhodians. That with the Romans, as it could not be perfected withoutan order from the people, they deferred until such time as ambassadorscould be sent to Rome. For the present, it was resolved, that threeambassadors should be sent to Lucius Quinctius; and that the wholeforce of the Achaeans should be brought up to Corinth, which cityQuinctius, after taking Cenchreae, was then besieging. The Achaeansaccordingly pitched their camp opposite to the gate that leads toSicyon. The Romans made their approaches on the side of the city whichfaces Cenchreae; Attalus having drawn his army across the isthmus,towards Lechaeum, the port on the opposite sea. At first, they did notpush forward their operations with any great degree of vigour, becausethey had hopes of a dissension breaking out between the townsmen andthe king's troops. But afterwards, learning that they all were ofone mind; that the Macedonians exerted themselves as if in defence oftheir common country; and that the Corinthians submitted to theorders of Androsthenes, commander of the garrison, as if he were theircountryman, and elected by their own suffrages; the assailants hadno other hopes but in force, arms, and their works. They thereforebrought up their mounds to the walls, though by very difficultapproaches. On that side where the Romans attacked, their ram haddemolished a considerable part of the wall; and the Macedonians havingrun together to defend the place thus stripped of its works, a furiousconflict ensued between themselves and the Romans. At first, byreason of the enemy's superiority in number, the Romans were quicklyrepulsed; but being joined by the auxiliary troops of Attalus and theAchaeans, they restored the fight to an equality; so that there wasno doubt that they would easily drive the Macedonians and Greeks fromtheir ground. But there were in the town a great multitude of Italiandeserters; some of whom, having been in Hannibal's army, had, throughfear of being punished by the Romans, followed Philip; others, havingbeen sailors, had lately quitted the fleets, and gone over, in hopesof more honourable employment: despair of safety, therefore, in caseof the Romans getting the better, inflamed these to a degree whichmight rather be called madness than courage. Opposite to Sicyon is thepromontory of Juno Acraea, as she is called, stretching out into themain, the passage to Corinth being about seven miles. To this placePhilocles, one of the king's generals, led, through Boeotia, fifteenhundred soldiers; and there were barks from Corinth ready to takethese troops on board, and carry them over to Lechaeum. Attalus, onthis, advised to burn the works, and raise the siege immediately;Quinctius was for persisting more obstinately in the attempt. However,when he saw the king's troops posted at the gates, and that thesallies of the besieged could not easily be withstood, he came overto the opinion of Attalus. Thus, their design proving fruitless, theydismissed the Achaeans, and returned to their ships. Attalus steeredto Piraeus, the Romans to Corcyra."Book 32,Chapter 24,"While the naval forces were thus employed, the consul, havingencamped before Elatia, in Phocis, first endeavoured, by conferringwith the principal inhabitants, to bring them over, and by their meansto effect his purpose; but on their answering that they had nothing intheir power, because the king's troops were more numerous and strongerthan the townsmen, he assaulted the city on all sides at once witharms and engines. A battering-ram having been brought up, shattereda part of the wall that reached from one tower to another, and thisfalling with a prodigious noise and crash, left much of the townexposed. On this a Roman cohort made an assault through the breach,while at the same time the townsmen, quitting their several posts,ran together from all parts to the place, which was endangered by theattack of the enemy. At the same time others of the Romans climbedover the ruins of the wall, and brought up scaling-ladders to theparts that were standing. As the conflict attracted the eyes andattention of the enemy to one particular spot, the walls were scaledin several places, by which means the soldiers easily entered thetown. The noise and tumult which ensued so terrified the enemy, thatquitting the place, which they had crowded together to defend,they all fled in panic to the citadel, accompanied by the unarmedmultitude. The consul having thus become master of the town, gaveit up to be plundered, and then sent messengers into the citadel,offering the king's troops their lives, on condition of their layingdown their arms, and departing. To the Elatians he offered theirliberty; which terms being agreed to, in a few days after he gotpossession of the citadel."Book 32,Chapter 25,"In consequence of Philocles, the king's general, coming intoAchaia, not only Corinth was delivered from the siege, but the cityof Argos was betrayed into his hands by some of the principalinhabitants, after they had first sounded the minds of the populace.They had a custom, that, on the first day of assembly, their praetors,for the omen's sake, should pronounce the names, Jupiter, Apollo, andHercules; in addition to which, a rule had been made, that, along withthese they should join the name of king Philip. After the conclusionof the alliance with the Romans, the herald did not make thataddition; on which a murmur spread through the multitude, who wouldadd the name of Philip, and insisting that the respect, due by law,should be paid as before; until at length the name was given outamidst universal approbation. On the encouragement afforded by thisfavourable disposition, Philocles was invited, who seized in the nighta strong post called Larissa, seated on a hill which overhangs thecity, and in which he placed a garrison. At the dawn of day, however,and as he was proceeding in order of battle to the forum, at the footof the hill he was met by a line of troops, drawn up to oppose him.This was a body of Achaeans, lately posted there, consisting ofabout five hundred young men, selected out of all the states. Theircommander was Aenesidemus, of Dymae. The king's general sent a personto recommend to them to evacuate the city, because they were not amatch for the townsmen alone, who held the same sentiments as theMacedonians; much less when these were joined by the Macedonians, whomeven the Romans had not withstood at Corinth. This at first had noeffect, either on the commander, or his men: and when they, soonafter, perceived the Argives also in arms, coming, in a greatbody, from the opposite side, perceiving that their destruction wasinevitable, they yet seemed determined to run every hazard, if theirleader would persevere. But Aenesidemus, unwilling that the flower ofthe Achaean youth should be lost, together with the city, made termswith Philocles, that they should have liberty to retire, while himselfremained armed with a few of his dependents, in the position which hehad occupied. To a person sent by Philocles to inquire what he meant,he only answered, standing with his shield held out before him,that he meant to die in arms in defence of the city intrusted to hischarge. Philocles then ordered some Thracians to throw their javelinsat him and his attendants; and they were all put to death. Thus,notwithstanding the alliance concluded by the Achaeans with theRomans, two of their cities, and those of the greatest consequence,Argos and Corinth, were still in the hands of Philip. Such were theservices performed during that summer by the land and sea forces ofRome employed in Greece."Book 32,Chapter 26,"In Gaul, the consul Sextus Aelius did nothing worth mention,though he had two armies in the province: one, which he had retainedunder their standards, although it ought to have been disbanded; andof this, which had served under Lucius Cornelius, proconsul, he hadgiven the command to Caius Helvius, the praetor: the other he hadbrought with him into the province. He spent nearly the whole summerin compelling the people of Cremona and Placentia to return to theircolonies, from whence they had been driven to various places by thecalamities of war. While Gaul, beyond expectation, remained quietthrough the whole year, an insurrection of the slaves was very neartaking place in the neighbourhood of the city. The hostages, givenby the Carthaginians, were kept in custody at Setia: as they werethe children of the principal families, they were attended by a greatmultitude of slaves; to this number many were added, in consequenceof the late African war, and by the Setians themselves having bought,from among the spoil, several of those which had been captured. Havingconspired together, they sent some of their number to engage in thecause the slaves of the country round Setia, and then those at Norbaand Circeii. When every thing was fully prepared, they determined,during the games which were soon to be solemnized at thefirst-mentioned place, to attack the people while intent on theshow, and when Setia had been taken in the midst of the slaughter andunexpected turmoil, then to seize on Norba and Circeii. Information ofthis atrocious plot was brought to Rome, to Lucius Cornelius Merula,the city praetor. Two slaves came to him before daylight, anddisclosed to him in order the whole proceedings and intentions ofthe conspirators. The praetor, ordering them to be guarded in his ownhouse, summoned a meeting of the senate; and having laid before themthe information of the discoverers, he was ordered to go himself tothe spot, and examine into and crush the conspiracy. Setting out,accordingly, with five lieutenant-generals, he compelled such as hefound in the country to take the military oath, to arm, and followhim. Having by this tumultuary kind of levy armed about two thousandmen, while all were ignorant of his destination, he came to Setia.There the leaders of the conspiracy were instantly apprehended; onwhich, the remainder fled from the city; but parties were sent throughthe country to search them out. The services of the two who made thediscovery, and of one free person employed, were highly meritorious.The senate ordered a present to the latter of a hundred thousand_asses_;[1] to the slaves, twenty-five thousand _asses_[2] each, andtheir freedom. The price was paid to their owners out of the treasury.Not long after, intelligence was received, that other slaves,belonging to the remains of the conspiracy, had formed a design ofseizing Praeneste. The praetor, Lucius Cornelius, went thither, andinflicted punishment on near five hundred persons concerned inthat wicked scheme. The public were under apprehensions that theCarthaginian hostages and prisoners fomented these plots: watcheswere, therefore, kept at Rome in all the streets, which the inferiormagistrates were ordered to go round and inspect; while the triumvirsof the prison, called the Quarry, were to keep a stricter guard thanusual. Circular letters were also sent by the praetor to all the Latinstates, directing that the hostages should be confined within doors,and not at any time allowed the liberty of going into public; and thatthe prisoners should be kept bound with fetters, of not less thanten pounds weight, and confined in no other place of custody than thecommon jail."Book 32,Chapter 27,"In this year, ambassadors from king Attalus made an offering, inthe Capitol, of a golden crown of two hundred and fifty-six pounds'weight, and returned thanks to the senate, because Antiochus,influenced by the authority of the Romans, had withdrawn his troopsout of the territories of Attalus. During the same summer, two hundredhorsemen, ten elephants, and two hundred thousand pecks of wheat,arrived from king Masinissa for the army in Greece. From Sicily also,and Sardinia, large supplies of provisions were sent, with clothingfor the troops. Sicily was then governed by Marcus Marcellus, Sardiniaby Marcus Porcius Cato, a man of acknowledged integrity and purityof conduct, but deemed too severe in punishing usury. He drove theusurers entirely out of the island; and restricted or abolished thecontributions, usually paid by the allies, for maintaining the dignityof the praetors. The consul, Sextus Aelius, coming home from Gaul toRome to hold the elections, elected consuls, Caius Cornelius Cethegusand Quintus Minucius Rufus. Two days after was held the electionof praetors; and this year, for the first time, six praetors wereappointed, in consequence of the increase of the provinces, and theextension of the bounds of the empire. The persons elected were,Lucius Manlius Vulso, Caius Sempronius Tuditanus, Marcus SergiusSilus, Marcus Helvius, Marcus Minucius Rufus, and Lucius Atilius. Ofthese Sempronius and Helvius were, at the time, plebeian aediles. Thecurule aediles were Quintus Minucius Thermus and Tiberius SemproniusLongus. The Roman games were four times repeated during this year."Book 32,Chapter 28,"On Caius Cornelius and Quintus Minucius becoming consuls, thefirst business of all was the arrangement of the provinces of theconsuls and praetors. Those of the praetors were the first settled,because that could be transacted by the lots. The city jurisdictionfell to Sergius; the foreign to Minucius; Atilius obtained Sardinia;Manlius, Sicily; Sempronius, the Hither Spain; and Helvius, theFarther. When the consuls were preparing to cast lots for Italy andMacedonia, Lucius Oppius and Quintus Fulvius, plebeian tribunes, stoodin their way, alleging, that ""Macedonia was a very distant province,and that the principal cause which had hitherto retarded the progressof the war, was, that when it was scarcely entered upon, and just atthe commencement of operations, the former consul was always recalled.This was the fourth year since the declaration of war againstMacedonia. The greater part of one year Sulpicius spent in seeking theking and his army; Villius, on the point of engaging the enemy, wasrecalled without any thing having been done. Quinctius was detainedat Rome, for the greater part of his year, by business respectingreligion; nevertheless, he had so conducted affairs, that had he comeearlier into the province, or had the cold season been at a greaterdistance, he might have put an end to hostilities. He was then justgoing into winter quarters; but, it was stated that he had brought thewar into such a state, that if he were not prevented by a intercessor,he seemed likely to complete it in the course of the ensuing summer.""By such arguments the tribunes so far prevailed, that the consulsdeclared that they would abide by the directions of the senate, if thetribunes would agree to do the same. Both parties having, accordingly,left the consultation perfectly free, a decree was passed, appointingthe two consuls to the government of the province of Italy. TitusQuinctius was continued in command, until a successor should accedeby a decree of the senate. To each, two legions were decreed; andthey were ordered, with these, to carry on the war with the CisalpineGauls, who had revolted from the Romans. A reinforcement of fivethousand foot and three hundred horse was ordered to be sent intoMacedonia to Quinctius, together with three thousand seamen. LuciusQuinctius Flamininus was continued in the command of the fleet. Toeach of the praetors for the two Spains were granted eight thousandfoot, of the allies and Latins, and four hundred horse; so that theymight discharge the veteran troops in their provinces. They werefurther directed to fix the bounds which should divide the hither fromthe farther province. Two additional lieutenant-generals were sent tothe army in Macedonia, Publius Sulpicius and Publius Villius, who hadbeen consuls in that province."Book 32,Chapter 29,"It was thought necessary, that before the consuls and praetorswent abroad, some prodigies should be expiated. For the temples ofVulcan and Summanus,[1] at Rome, and a wall and a gate at Fregellae,had been struck by lightning. At Frusino, light had shone forth duringthe night. At Asculum, a lamb had been born with two heads and fivefeet. At Formiae, two wolves entering the town had torn severalpersons who fell in their way; and, at Rome, a wolf had made its way,not only into the city, but into the Capitol. Caius Acilius, plebeiantribune, caused an order to be passed, that five colonies should beled out to the sea-coast; two to the mouths of the rivers Vulturnusand Liternus; one to Puteoli and one to the fort of Salernum. To thesewas added Buxentum. To each colony three hundred families were orderedto be sent. The commissioners appointed to conduct them thither, andwho were to hold the office for three years, were Marcus ServiliusGeminus, Quintus Minucius Thermus, and Tiberius Sempronius Longus. Assoon as the levies, and such other business, religious and civil, asrequired their personal attendance, was finished, both the consuls setout for Gaul. Cornelius took the direct road towards the Insubrians,who were then in arms, and had been joined by the Caenomanians.Quintus Minucius turned his route to the left side of Italy, andleading away his army to the lower sea, to Genoa, opened the campaignwith an invasion of Liguria. Two towns, Clastidium and Litubium, bothbelonging to the Ligurians, and two states of the same nation, Celelaand Cerdicium, surrendered to him. And now, all the states on thisside of the Po, except the Boians among the Gauls and the Ilvatiansamong the Ligurians, were reduced to submission: no less, it is said,than fifteen towns and twenty thousand men surrendered themselves. Hethen led his legions into the territory of the Boians."Book 32,Chapter 30,"The Boian army had, not very long before, crossed the Po andjoined the Insubrians and Caenomanians; for, having heard that theconsuls intended to act with their forces united, they wished toincrease their own strength by this junction. But when informationreached them that one of the consuls was ravaging the country of theBoians, a dispute instantly arose. The Boians demanded, that all, inconjunction, should carry succour to those who were attacked; whilethe Insubrians positively refused to leave their country defenceless.In consequence of this dissension, the armies separated; the Boianswent to defend their own territory, and the Insubrians, with theCaenomanians, encamped on the banks of the river Mincius. About fivemiles below this spot, the consul Cornelius pitched his camp closeto the same river. Sending emissaries hence into the villages of theCaenomanians, and to Brixia, the capital of their tribe, he learnedwith certainty that their young men had taken arms without theapprobation of the elders; and that the Caenomanians had not joinedin the revolt of the Insubrians by any public authority. On whichhe invited to him the principal of the natives, and endeavoured tocontrive and concert with them that the Caenomanians should separatefrom the Insubrians; and either march away and return home, or comeover to the side of the Romans. This he was not able to effect; butso far, he received solemn assurances that, in case of a battle, theywould either stand inactive, or, should any occasion offer, would evenassist the Romans. The Insubrians knew not that such an agreementhad been concluded, but they harboured in their minds some kind ofsuspicion, that the fidelity of their confederates was wavering.Wherefore, in forming their troops for battle, not daring to intrusteither wing to them, lest, if they should treacherously give ground,they might cause a total defeat, they placed them in reserve behindthe line. At the beginning of the fight, the consul vowed a temple toJuno Sospita, provided the enemy should, on that day, be routedand driven from the field; on which the soldiers raised a shout,declaring, that they would insure to their commander the completionof his vow, and at the same time an attack was made on the enemy. TheInsubrians did not stand even the first onset. Some writers affirm,that the Caenomanians, falling on their rear during the heat of theengagement, caused as much disorder there as prevailed in their front:and that, thus assailed on both sides, thirty-five thousand of themwere slain, five thousand seven hundred taken prisoners, among whomwas Hamilcar, a Carthaginian general, who had been the cause of thewar; and that a hundred and thirty military standards and above twohundred waggons were taken. On this, the towns of the Gauls, which hadjoined in the revolt of the Insubrians, surrendered to the Romans."Book 32,Chapter 31,"The other consul, Minucius, had at first traversed the territoriesof the Boians, with wide-spread ravaging parties; but afterwards, whenthat people left the Insubrians, and came home to defend their ownproperty, he kept his men within their camp, expecting to come to aregular engagement with the enemy. Nor would the Boians have declineda battle, if their spirits had not been depressed by hearing of thedefeat of the Insubrians. Upon this, deserting their commander andtheir camp, they dispersed themselves through the several towns, eachwishing to take care of his own effects. Thus they changed the enemy'smethod of carrying on the war: for, no longer hoping to decide thematter by a single battle, he began again to lay waste the lands,burn the houses, and storm the villages. At this time, Clastidiumwas burned, and the legions were led thence against the IlvatianLigurians, who alone refused to submit. That state, also, on learningthat the Insubrians had been defeated in battle, and the Boians soterrified that they had not dared to try the fortune of an engagement,made a submission. Letters from the consuls, containing accountsof their successes, came from Gaul to Rome at the same time. MarcusSergius, city praetor, read them in the senate, and afterwards, bydirection of the fathers, in an assembly of the people; on which asupplication, of four days' continuance, was decreed."Book 32,Chapter 32,"It was by this time winter; and while Titus Quinctius, after thereduction of Elatia, had his winter quarters distributed in Phocis andLocris, a violent dissension broke out at Opus. One faction invitedto their assistance the Aetolians who were nearest at hand; the other,the Romans. The Aetolians arrived first; but the other party, whichwas the more powerful, refused them admittance, and, despatching acourier to the Roman general, held the city until his arrival. Thecitadel was possessed by a garrison belonging to the king, and theycould not be prevailed on to retire from thence, either by the threatsof the people of Opus, or by the authority of the Roman consul'scommands. What prevented their being immediately attacked was, thearrival of an envoy from the king, to solicit the appointing of a timeand place for a conference. This was granted to the king with greatreluctance; not that Quinctius did not wish to see war concluded underhis own auspices, partly by arms, and partly by negotiation: for heknew not, yet, whether one of the new consuls would be sent out as hissuccessor, or whether he should be continued in the command; a pointwhich he had charged his friends and relations to labour for withall their might. But he thought that a conference would answer thispurpose; that it would put it in his power to give matters a turntowards war, in case he remained in the province, or towards peace,if he were to be removed. They chose for the meeting a part of thesea-shore, in the Malian gulf, near Nicaea. Thither Philip came fromDemetrias, with five barks and one ship of war: he was accompanied bysome principal Macedonians, and an Achaean exile, name Cycliades, aman of considerable note. With the Roman general, were king Amynander,Dionysidorus, ambassador from king Attalus, Agesimbrotus, commanderof the Rhodian fleet, Phaeneas, praetor of the Aetolians, and twoAchaeans, Aristaenus and Xenophon. Attended by these, the Romangeneral advanced to the brink of the shore, when the king had comeforward to the prow of his vessel, as it lay at anchor; and said, ""Ifyou will come on the shore, we shall mutually speak and hear withmore convenience."" This the king refused; and on Quinctius asking him,""Whom do you fear?"" With the haughty spirit of royalty, he replied,""Fear I have none, but of the immortal gods; but I have no confidencein the faith of those whom I see about you, and least of all in theAetolians."" ""That danger,"" said the Roman, ""is equal to all in commonwho confer with an enemy, if no confidence subsists."" ""But, TitusQuinctius,"" replied the king, ""if treachery be intended, the prizes ofperfidy are not equal, namely, Philip and Phaeneas. For it will notbe so difficult for the Aetolians to find another praetor, as for theMacedonians to find another king in my place.""--Silence then ensued."Book 32,Chapter 33,"The Roman expected that he who solicited the conference shouldopen it; and the king thought that he who was to prescribe, not he whoreceived, terms of peace, ought to begin the conference. At length theRoman said, that ""his discourse should be very simple; for hewould only mention those articles, without which there could be noconditions of peace. These were, that the king should withdraw hisgarrisons from all the cities of Greece. That he should deliver upto the allies of the Roman people the prisoners and deserters; shouldrestore to the Romans those places in Illyricum of which he hadpossessed himself by force, since the peace concluded in Epirus; andto Ptolemy, king of Egypt, the cities which he had seized since thedeath of Ptolemy Philopater."" These were the terms which he required,on behalf of himself and the Roman people: but it was proper that thedemands of the allies, also, should be heard. The ambassador of kingAttalus demanded ""restitution of the ships and prisoners taken inthe sea-fight at Cius; and that Nicephorium, and the temple of Venus,which Philip had pillaged and defaced, should be restored as thoughthey had not been injured."" The Rhodians laid claim to Peraea, a tracton the continent, lying opposite to their island, which from earlytimes had been under their jurisdiction; and they required that ""thegarrisons should be withdrawn from Tassus, Bargylii, and Euroma, andfrom Sestus and Abydos on the Hellespont; that Perinthus should berestored to the Byzantians, in right of their ancient title, andthat all the sea-port towns and harbours of Asia should be free.""The Achaeans demanded the restoration of Corinth and Argos. Phaeneasnearly repeated the demands made by the Romans, that the troops shouldwithdraw out of Greece, and the Aetolians be put in possession of thecities which had formerly been under their dominion. He was followedby Alexander, a man of eminence among the Aetolians, and, consideringhis country, not uneloquent. He said, that ""he had long kept silence,not because he expected that any business would be effected in thatconference, but because he was unwilling to interrupt any of theallies in their discourse."" He asserted, that ""Philip was neithertreating for peace with sincerity; and that he had never waged warwith true courage, at any time: that in negotiating, he was insidiousand fradulent; while in war he never fought on equal ground, norengaged in regular battles; but, skulking about, burned and pillagedtowns, and, when worsted, destroyed the prizes of victory. But not inthat manner did the ancient kings of Macedon behave; they decided thefate of the war in the field, and spared the towns as far as they wereable, in order to possess the more opulent empire. For what sort ofconduct was it, to destroy the objects for the possession of which thecontest was waged, and thereby leave nothing to himself but fighting?Philip had, in the last year, desolated more cities of his alliesin Thessaly, than all the enemies that Thessaly ever had. On theAetolians themselves he had made greater depredations, when he was inalliance with them, than since he became their enemy. He had seizedon Lysimachia, after dislodging the praetor and garrison of theAetolians. Cius also, a city belonging to their government, he razedfrom the foundation. With the same injustice he held possession ofThebes in Phthiotis, of Echinus, Larissa, and Pharsalus."""Book 32,Chapter 34,"Philip, provoked by this discourse of Alexander, pushed his shipnearer to the land, that he might be the better heard, and began tospeak with much violence, particularly against the Aetolians. ButPhaeneas, interrupting him, said that ""the business depended not uponwords; he must either conquer in war, or submit to his superiors.""""That, indeed, is evident,"" said Philip, ""even to the blind,""reflecting on Phaeneas, who had a disorder in his eyes: for he wasnaturally fonder of such pleasantries than became a king; and even inthe midst of serious business, did not sufficiently restrain himselffrom ridicule. He then began to express great indignation at the""Aetolians assuming as much importance as the Romans, and insistingon his evacuating Greece; people who could not even tell what were itsboundaries. For, of Aetolia itself, a large proportion, consisting ofthe Agraeans, Apodeotians, and Amphilochians, was no part of Greece.Have they just ground of complaint against me for not refraining fromwar with their allies, when themselves, from the earliest period,follow, as an established rule, the practice of suffering their youngmen to carry arms against those allies, withholding only the publicauthority of the state; while very frequently contending armies haveAetolian auxiliaries on both sides? I did not seize on Cius by force,but assisted my friend and ally, Prusias, who was besieging it, andLysimachia I rescued from the Thracians. But since necessity divertedmy attention from the guarding of it to this present war, theThracians have possession of it. So much for the Aetolians. To Attalusand the Rhodians I in justice owe nothing; for not to me, but tothemselves, is the commencement of hostilities to be attributed.However, out of respect to the Romans, I will restore Peraea to theRhodians, and to Attalus his ships, and such prisoners as can befound. As to what concerns Nicephorium, and the temple of Venus, whatother answer can I make to those who require their restoration, thanthat I will take on myself the trouble and expense of replantingthem--the only way in which woods and groves which have been cut downcan be restored,--since it is thought fit that, between kings, suchkinds of demands should be made and answered."" The last part of hisspeech was directed to the Achaeans, wherein he enumerated, first, thekindnesses of Antigonus; then, his own towards their nation, desiringthem to consider the decrees themselves had passed concerning him,which comprehended every kind of honour, divine and human; and tothese he added their late decree, by which they had confirmed theresolution of deserting him. He inveighed bitterly against theirperfidy, but told them, that nevertheless he would give them backArgos. ""With regard to Corinth, he would consult with the Romangeneral; and would, at the same time, inquire from him, whether hethought it right, that he (Philip) should evacuate only those citieswhich, being captured by himself, were held by the right of war; orthose, also, which he had received from his ancestors."""Book 32,Chapter 35,"The Achaeans and Aetolians were preparing to answer, but, as thesun was near setting, the conference was adjourned to the next day;and Philip returned to his station whence he came, the Romans andallies to their camp. On the following day, Quinctius repaired toNicaea, which was the place agreed on, at the appointed time; butneither Philip, nor any messenger from him, came for several hours. Atlength, when they began to despair of his coming, his ships suddenlyappeared. He said, that ""the terms enjoined were so severe andhumiliating, that, not knowing what to determine, he had spent the dayin deliberation."" But the general opinion was, that he had purposelydelayed the business until late, that the Achaeans and Aetolians mightnot have time to answer him: and this opinion he himself confirmed, bydesiring that time might not be consumed in altercation, and, to bringthe affair to some conclusion, that the others should retire, andleave him to converse with the Roman general. For some time this wasnot admitted, lest the allies should appear to be excluded from theconference. Afterwards, on his persisting in his desire, the Romangeneral, with the consent of all, taking with him Appius Claudius,a military tribune, advanced to the brink of the coast, and the restretired. The king, with the two persons whom he had brought the daybefore, came on shore, where they conversed a considerable time inprivate. What account of their proceedings Philip gave to his peopleis not well known: what Quinctius told the allies was, that ""Philipwas willing to cede to the Romans the whole coast of Illyricum, andto give up the deserters and prisoners, if there were any. That heconsented to restore to Attalus his ships, and the seamen taken withthem; and to the Rhodians the tract which they call Peraea. That herefused to evacuate Iassus and Bargylii. To the Aetolians he was readyto restore Pharsalus and Larissa; Thebes he would not restore: andthat he would give back to the Achaeans the possession, not only ofArgos, but of Corinth also."" This arrangement pleased none of theparties; neither those to whom the concessions were to be made, northose to whom they were refused; ""for on that plan,"" they said, ""morewould be lost than gained; nor could the grounds of contention ever beremoved, but by his withdrawing his forces from every part of Greece."""Book 32,Chapter 36,"These expressions, delivered with eagerness and vehemence by everyone in the assembly, reached the ears of Philip, though he stood at adistance. He therefore requested of Quinctius, that the whole businessmight be deferred until the next day; and then he would, positively,either prevail on the allies, or suffer himself to be prevailed on bythem. The shore at Thronium was appointed for their meeting, and therethey assembled early. Philip began with entreating Quinctius, and allwho were present, not to harbour such sentiments as must embarrassa negotiation of peace; and then desired time, while he could sendambassadors to Rome, to the senate, declaring, that ""he would eitherobtain a peace on the terms mentioned, or would accept whatever termsthe senate should prescribe."" None by any means approved of this; theysaid, he only sought a delay, and leisure to collect his strength.But Quinctius observed, ""that such an objection would have beenwell founded, if it were then summer and a season fit for action; asmatters stood, and the winter being just at hand, nothing wouldbe lost by allowing him time to send ambassadors. For, without theauthority of the senate, no agreement which they might conclude withthe king would be valid; and besides, they would by this means havean opportunity, while the winter itself would necessarily causea suspension of arms, to learn the authoritative decision of thesenate."" The other chiefs of the allies came over to this opinion: anda cessation of hostilities for two months being granted, they resolvedthat each of their states should send an ambassador with the necessaryinformation to the senate, and in order that it should not be deceivedby the misrepresentations of Philip. To the above agreement for atruce, was added an article, that all the king's troops should beimmediately withdrawn from Phocis and Locris. With the ambassadors ofthe allies, Quinctius sent Amynander, king of Athamania; and, to adda degree of splendour to the embassy, a deputation from himself,composed of Quintus Fabius, the son of his wife's sister, QuintusFulvius, and Appius Claudius."Book 32,Chapter 37,"On their arrival at Rome, the ambassadors of the allies wereadmitted to audience before those of the king. Their discourse, ingeneral, was filled up with invectives against Philip. What producedthe greatest effect on the minds of the senate was, that, by pointingout the relative situations of the lands and seas in that part ofthe world, they made it manifest to every one, that if the king heldDemetrias in Thessaly, Chalcis in Euboea, and Corinth in Achaia,Greece could not be free; and they added, that Philip himself, withnot more insolence than truth, used to call these the fetters ofGreece. The king's ambassadors were then introduced, and when theywere beginning a long harangue, a short question cut shorttheir discourse:--Whether he was willing to yield up the threeabove-mentioned cities? They answered, that they had received nospecific instructions on that head: on which they were dismissed,the negotiation being left unsettled. Full authority was given toQuinctius to determine every thing relative to war and peace. As thisdemonstrated clearly that the senate were not weary of the war, sohe, who was more earnestly desirous of conquest than of peace, neverafterwards consented to a conference with Philip; and even gave himnotice that he would not admit any embassy from him, unless it camewith information that he was retiring from the whole of Greece."Book 32,Chapter 38,"Philip now perceived that he must decide the matter in thefield, and collect his strength about him from all quarters. Beingparticularly uneasy in respect to the cities of Achaia, a countryso distant from him, and also of Argos, even more, indeed, than ofCorinth, he resolved, as the most advisable method, to put the formerinto the hands of Nabis, tyrant of Lacedaemon, in trust, as it were,on the terms, that if he should prove successful in the war, Nabisshould re-deliver it to him; if any misfortune should happen, heshould keep it himself. Accordingly, he wrote to Philocles, who hadthe command in Corinth and Argos, to have a meeting with the tyrant.Philocles, besides coming with a valuable present, added to thatpledge of future friendship between the king and the tyrant, that itwas Philip's wish to unite his daughters in marriage to the sons ofNabis. The tyrant, at first, refused to receive the city on any otherconditions than that of being invited to its protection by a decreeof the Argives themselves: but afterwards, hearing that in a fullassembly they had treated the name of the tyrant not only with scorn,but even with abhorrence, he thought he had now a sufficient excusefor plundering them, and he accordingly desired Philocles to give himpossession of the place as soon as he pleased. Nabis was admitted intothe city in the night, without the privity of any of the inhabitants,and, at the first light, seized on the higher parts of it, and shutthe gates. A few of the principal people having made their escape,during the first confusion, the properties of all who were absent wereseized as booty: those who were present were stripped of their goldand silver, and loaded with exorbitant contributions. Such as paidthese readily were discharged, without personal insult and lacerationof their bodies; but such as were suspected of hiding or reservingany of their effects, were mangled and tortured like slaves. He thensummoned an assembly, in which he promulgated two measures; one foran abolition of debts, the other for a distribution of the land, inshares, to each man--two fire-brands in the hands of those who weredesirous of revolution, for inflaming the populace against the higherranks."Book 32,Chapter 39,"The tyrant, when he had the city of Argos in his power, neverconsidering from whom or on what conditions he had received it, sentambassadors to Elatia, to Quinctius, and to Attalus, in his winterquarters at Aegina, to tell them, that ""he was in possession of Argos;and that if Quinctius would come hither, and consult with him, hehad no doubt but that every thing might be adjusted between them.""Quinctius, in order that he might deprive Philip of that stronghold,along with the rest, consented to come; accordingly, sending a messageto Attalus, to leave Aegina, and meet him at Sicyon, he set sail fromAnticyra with ten quinqueremes, which his brother, Lucius Quinctius,happened to have brought a little before from his winter station atCorcyra, and passed over to Sicyon. Attalus was there before him, who,representing that the tyrant ought to come to the Roman general, notthe general to the tyrant, brought Quinctius over to his opinion,which was, that he should not enter the city of Argos. Not far fromit, however, was a place called Mycenica; and there the parties agreedto meet. Quinctius came, with his brother and a few military tribunes;Attalus, with his royal retinue; and Nicostratus the praetor of theAchaeans, with a few of the auxiliary officers: and they there foundNabis waiting with his whole army. He advanced, armed, and attendedby his armed guards, almost to the middle of the interjacent plain;Quinctius unarmed, with his brother and two military tribunes; theking was accompanied by one of his nobles, and the praetor of theAchaeans, unarmed likewise. The tyrant, when he saw the king and theRoman general unarmed, opened the conference, with apologizing forhaving come to the meeting armed himself, and surrounded with armedmen. ""He had no apprehensions,"" he said, ""from them; but only fromthe Argive exiles."" When they then began to treat of the conditions oftheir friendship, the Roman made two demands: one, that the war withthe Achaeans should be put an end to; the other, that he should sendhim aid against Philip. He promised the aid required; but, instead ofa peace with the Achaeans, a cessation of hostilities was obtained, tolast until the war with Philip should be concluded."Book 32,Chapter 40,"A debate concerning the Argives, also, was set on foot by kingAttalus, who charged Nabis with holding their city by force, whichwas put into his hands by the treachery of Philocles; while Nabisinsisted, that he had been invited by the Argives themselves to affordthem protection. The king required a general assembly of the Argivesto be convened, that the truth of that matter might be known. Tothis the tyrant did not object; but the king alleged, that theLacedaemonian troops ought to be withdrawn from the city, in orderto render the assembly free; and that the people should be leftat liberty to declare their real sentiments. The tyrant refusedto withdraw them, and the debate produced no effect. To the Romangeneral, six hundred Cretans were given by Nabis, who agreed with thepraetor of the Achaeans to a cessation of arms for four months,and thus they departed from the conference. Quinctius proceeded toCorinth, advancing to the gates with the cohort of Cretans, in orderthat it might be evident to Philocles, the governor of the city, thatthe tyrant had deserted the cause of Philip. Philocles himself cameout to confer with the Roman general; and, on the latter exhortinghim to change sides immediately, and surrender the city he answered insuch a manner as showed an inclination rather to defer than to refusethe matter. From Corinth, Quinctius sailed over to Anticyra, andsent his brother thence, to sound the disposition of the people ofAcarnania. Attalus went from Argos to Sicyon. Here, on one side, thestate added new honours to those formerly paid to the king; and, onthe other, the king, besides having on a former occasion, redeemed forthem, at a vast expense, a piece of land sacred to Apollo, unwillingto pass by the city of his friends and allies without a token ofmunificence, made them a present of ten talents of silver,[1] and tenthousand bushels of corn, and then returned to Cenchreae to his fleet.Nabis, leaving a strong garrison at Argos, returned to Lacedaemon;and, as he himself had pillaged the men, he sent his wife to Argosto pillage the women. She invited the females to her house, sometimessingly, and sometimes several together, who were united by familyconnexion; and partly by fair speeches, partly by threats, strippedthem, not only of their gold, but, at last, even of their garments,and every article of female attire."Book 33,Chapter 1,"Such were the occurrences of the winter. In the beginning ofspring, Quinctius, having summoned Attalus to Elatia, and beinganxious to bring under his authority the nation of the Boeotians, whohad until then been wavering in their dispositions, marched throughPhocis, and pitched his camp at the distance of five miles fromThebes, the capital of Boeotia. Next day, attended by one company ofsoldiers, and by Attalus, together with the ambassadors, who had cometo him in great numbers from all quarters, he proceeded towards thecity, having ordered the spearmen of two legions, being twothousand men, to follow him at the distance of a mile. About midway,Antiphilus, praetor of the Boeotians, met him: the rest of the peoplestood on the walls, watching the arrival of the king and the Romangeneral. Few arms and few soldiers appeared around them--the hollowroads, and the valleys concealing from view the spearmen, who followedat a distance. When Quinctius drew near the city, he slackened hispace, as if with intention to salute the multitude, who came out tomeet him; but the real motive of his delaying was, that the spearmenmight come up. The townsmen pushed forward, in a crowd, before thelictors, not perceiving the band of soldiers who were following themclose, until they arrived at the general's quarters. Then, supposingthe city betrayed and taken, through the treachery of Antiphilus,their praetor, they were all struck with astonishment and dismay.It was now evident that no room was left to the Boeotians for a freediscussion of measures in the assembly, which was summoned for thefollowing day. However, they concealed their grief, which it wouldhave been both vain and unsafe to have discovered."Book 33,Chapter 2,"When the assembly met, Attalus first rose to speak, and he beganhis discourse with a recital of the kindnesses conferred by hisancestors and himself on the Greeks in general, and on the Boeotiansin particular. But, being now too old and infirm to bear the exertionof speaking in public, he lost his voice and fell; and for some time,while they were carrying him to his apartments, (for he was deprivedof the use of one half of his limbs,) the proceedings of the assemblywere for a short time suspended. Then Aristaenus spoke on the part ofthe Achaeans, and was listened to with the greater attention, becausehe recommended to the Boeotians no other measures than those which hehad recommended to the Achaeans. A few words were added by Quinctius,extolling the good faith rather than the arms and power of the Romans.A resolution was then proposed, by Dicaearchus of Plataea, for forminga treaty of friendship with the Roman people, which was read; and noone daring to offer any opposition, it was received and passed by thesuffrages of all the states of Boeotia. When the assembly broke up,Quinctius made no longer stay at Thebes than the sudden accidentto Attalus made necessary. When it appeared that the force of thedisorder had not brought the king's life into any immediate danger,but had only occasioned a weakness in his limbs, he left him there,to use the necessary means for recovery, and returned to Elatia, fromwhence he had come. Having now brought the Boeotians, as formerlythe Achaeans, to join in the confederacy, while all places were leftbehind him in a state of tranquillity and safety, he bent his wholeattention towards Philip, and the remaining business of the war."Book 33,Chapter 3,"Philip, on his part, as his ambassadors had brought no hopes ofpeace from Rome, resolved, as soon as spring began, to levy soldiersthrough every town in his dominions: but he found a great scarcity ofyoung men; for successive wars, through several generations, had verymuch exhausted the Macedonians, and, even in the course of his ownreign great numbers had fallen, in the naval engagements with theRhodians and Attalus, and in those on land with the Romans. Mereyouths, therefore, from the age of sixteen, were enlisted; and eventhose who had served out their time, provided they had any remains ofstrength, were recalled to their standards. Having, by these means,filled up the numbers of his army about the vernal equinox, he drewtogether all his forces to Dius: he encamped them there in a fixedpost; and, exercising the soldiers every day, waited for the enemy.About the same time Quinctius left Elatia, and came by Thronium andScarphea to Thermopylae. There he held an assembly of the Aetolians,which had been summoned to meet at Heraclea, to determine with whatnumber of auxiliaries they should follow the Roman general to the war.On the third day, having learned the determination of the allies,he proceeded from Heraclea to Xyniae; and, pitching his camp on theconfines between the Aenians and Thessalians, waited for the Aetolianauxiliaries. The Aetolians occasioned no delay. Six hundred foot andfour hundred horse, under the command of Phaeneas, speedily joinedhim; and then Quinctius, to show plainly what he had waited for,immediately decamped. On passing into the country of Phthiotis, hewas joined by five hundred Cretans of Gortynium, whose commander wasCydantes, with three hundred Apollonians, armed nearly in the samemanner; and not long after, by Amynander, with one thousand twohundred Athamanian foot."Book 33,Chapter 4,"Philip, being informed of the departure of the Romans from Elatia,and considering that, on the approaching contest, his kingdom wasat hazard, thought it advisable to make an encouraging speech tohis soldiers; in which, after he had expatiated on many topics oftenalluded to before, respecting the virtues of their ancestors, and themilitary fame of the Macedonians, he touched particularly on thoseconsiderations which at the time threw the greatest damp on theirspirits, and on those by which they might be animated to some degreeof confidence. To the defeat thrice suffered at the narrow passesnear the river Aous, by the phalanx of the Macedonians, he opposedthe repulse given by main force to the Romans at Atrax: and even withrespect to the former case, when they had not maintained possessionof the pass leading into Epirus, he said, ""the first fault was to beimputed to those who had been negligent in keeping the guards; andthe second, to the light infantry and mercenaries in the time of theengagement; but that, as to the phalanx of the Macedonians, it hadstood firm on that occasion; and would for ever remain invincible, onequal ground, and in regular fight."" This body consisted of sixteenthousand men, the prime strength of the army, and of the kingdom.Besides these, he had two thousand targeteers, called Peltastae;of Thracians, and Illyrians of the tribe called Trallians, the likenumber of two thousand; and of hired auxiliaries, collected out ofvarious nations, about one thousand; and two thousand horse. With thisforce the king waited for the enemy. The Romans had nearly an equalnumber; in cavalry alone they had a superiority, by the addition ofthe Aetolians."Book 33,Chapter 5,"Quinctius, having decamped to Thebes in Phthiotis, and havingreceived encouragement to hope that the city would be betrayed to himby Timon, a leading man in the state, came up close to the walls withonly a small number of cavalry and some light infantry. So entirelywere his expectations disappointed, that he was not only obliged tomaintain a fight with the enemy who sallied out against him, but wouldhave incurred a fearful conflict had not both infantry and cavalrybeen called out hastily from the camp, and come up in time. Notmeeting with that success which he had too inconsiderately expected,he desisted from any further attempt to take the city at present. Hehad received certain information of the king being in Thessaly; butas he had not yet discovered into what part of it he had come, he senthis soldiers round the country, with orders to cut timber and preparepalisades. Both Macedonians and Greeks had palisades; but the latterhad not adopted the most convenient mode of using them, eitherwith respect to carriage, or for the purpose of strengthening theirfortifications. They cut trees both too large and too full of branchesfor a soldier to carry easily along with his arms: and after theyhad fenced their camp with a line of these, the demolition of theirpalisade was no difficult matter; for the trunks of large treesappearing to view, with great intervals between them, and the numerousand strong shoots affording the hand a good hold, two, or at mostthree young men, uniting their efforts, used to pull out one tree,which, being removed, a breach was opened as wide as a gate, and therewas nothing at hand with which it could be stopped up. But the Romanscut light stakes, mostly of one fork, with three, or at the most fourbranches; so that a soldier, with his arms slung at his back, canconveniently carry several of them together; and then they stick themdown so closely, and interweave the branches in such a manner, thatit cannot be seen to what main stem any branch belongs; besides which,the boughs are so sharp, and wrought so intimately with each other,as to leave no room for a hand to be thrust between; consequently anenemy cannot lay hold of any thing capable of being dragged out,or, if that could be done, could he draw out the branches thusintertwined, and which mutually bind each other. And even if, byaccident, one should be pulled out, it leaves but a small opening,which is very easily filled up."Book 33,Chapter 6,"Next day Quinctius, causing his men to carry palisades with them,that they might be ready to encamp on any spot, marched forward ashort way, and took post about six miles from Pherae; whence he sentscouts to discover in what part of Thessaly the king was, and whatappeared to be his intention. Philip was then near Larissa, and assoon as he learnt that the Roman general had removed from Thebes,being equally impatient for a decisive engagement, he proceededtowards the enemy, and pitched his camp about four miles from Pherae.On the day following, some light troops went out from both camps, toseize on certain hills, which over looked the city. When, nearly atequal distance from summit which was intended to be seized, they camewithin sight of each other, they halted; and sending messengers totheir respective camps for directions, how they were to proceed onthis unexpected meeting with the enemy, waited their return in quiet.For that day, they were recalled to their camps, without havingcommenced any engagement. On the following day, there was a battlebetween the cavalry, near the same hills, in which the Aetoliansbore no small part; and in which the king's troops were defeated,and driven into their camp. Both parties were greatly impeded inthe action, by the ground being thickly planted with trees; by thegardens, of which there were many in a place so near the city; and bythe roads being enclosed between walls, and in some places shut up.The commanders, therefore, were equally desirous of removing out ofthat quarter; and, as if by a preconcerted scheme, they both directedtheir route to Scotussa: Philip with the hope of getting a supply ofcorn there; the Roman intending to get before the enemy and destroythe crops. The armies marched the whole day without having sight ofeach other in any place, the view being intercepted by a continuedrange of hills between them. The Romans encamped at Eretria, inPhthiotis; Philip, on the river Onchestus. But though Philip lay atMelambius, in the territory of Scotussa, and Quinctius near Thetidium,in Pharsalia, neither party knew with any certainty where hisantagonist was. On the third day, there first fell a violent rain,which was succeeded by darkness equal to that of night, and thisconfined the Romans to their camp, through fear of an ambuscade."Book 33,Chapter 7,"Philip, intent on hastening his march, and in no degree deterred bythe clouds, which after the rain lowered over the face of the country,ordered his troops to march: and yet so thick a fog had obscured theday, that neither the standard-bearers could see the road, nor thesoldiers the standards; so that all, led blindly by the shouts ofuncertain guides, fell into disorder, like men wandering by night.When they had passed over the hills called Cynoscephalae, wherethey set a strong guard of foot and horse, they pitched their camp.Although the Roman general staid at Thetidium, yet he detatched troopsof horse and one thousand foot, to find out where the enemy lay;warning them, however, to beware of ambuscades, which the darkness ofthe day would cover, even in an open country. When these arrived atthe hills, where the enemy's guard was posted, struck with mutualfear, both parties stood, as if deprived of the power of motion. Theythen sent back messengers to their respective commanders; and when thefirst surprise subsided, they proceeded to action without more delay.The fight was begun by small advanced parties; and afterwards thenumbers of the combatants were increased by reinforcements of men, whosupported those who gave way. In this contest the Romans, being farinferior to their adversaries, sent message after message to thegeneral, that they were being overpowered; on which he hastily sentfive hundred horse and two thousand foot, mostly Aetolians, under thecommand of two military tribunes, who relieved them, and restored thefight. The Macedonians, distressed in turn by this change of fortune,sent to beg succour from their king; but as, on account of the generaldarkness from the fog, he had expected nothing less, on that day, thana battle, and had therefore sent a great number of men, of every kind,to forage, he was, for a considerable time, in great perplexity, andunable to form a resolution. Subsequently, as the messengers stillcontinued to urge him, and the covering of clouds was now removedfrom the tops of the mountains, and the Macedonian party was in view,having been driven up to the highest summit, and trusting for safetyrather to the nature of the ground than to their arms, he thought itnecessary, at all events, to hazard the whole, in order to preventthe loss of a part, for want of support; and, accordingly, he sentup Athenagoras, general of the mercenary soldiers, with all theauxiliaries, except the Thracians, joined by the Macedonian andThessalian cavalry. On their arrival, the Romans were forced from thetop of the hill, and did not face about until they came to the levelplain. The principal support which saved them from being driven downin disorderly flight, was the Aetolian horsemen. The Aetolianswere then by far the best cavalry in Greece; in infantry, they weresurpassed by some of their neighbours."Book 33,Chapter 8,"This affair was represented as more successful than the advantagegained in the battle could warrant; for people came, one afteranother, and calling out that the Romans were flying in a panic; sothat, though reluctant and hesitating declaring it a rash proceeding,and that he liked not either place or the time, yet he was prevailedupon to draw out his whole force to battle. The Roman general did thesame, induced by necessity, rather than by the favourableness of theoccasion. Leaving the right wing as a reserve, having the elephantsposted in front, he, with the left, and all the right infantry,advanced against the enemy; at the same time reminding his men, that""they were going to fight the same Macedonians whom they had fought inthe passes of Epirus, fenced, as they were, with mountains and rivers,and whom, after conquering the natural difficulties of the ground,they had dislodged and vanquished; the same, whom they had beforedefeated under the command of Publius Sulpicius, when they opposedtheir passage to Eordaea. That the kingdom of Macedonia had beenhitherto supported by its reputation, not by real strength; and thateven that reputation had, at length, vanished."" Quinctius soon reachedhis troops, who stood in the bottom of the valley; and they, on thearrival of their general and the army, renewed the fight, and, makinga vigorous onset, compelled the enemy again to turn their backs.Philip, with the targeteers, and the right wing of infantry, (the mainstrength of the Macedonian army, called by them the phalanx,) advancedat a quick pace, having ordered Nicanor, one of his courtiers, tobring up the rest of his forces with all speed. At first, on reachingthe top of the hill, from a few arms and bodies lying there, heperceived that there had been an engagement on the spot, and that theRomans had been repulsed from it. When he likewise saw the fight nowgoing on close to the enemy's works, he was elated with excessivedelight; but presently, observing his men flying back, and that thepanic was on the other side, he was much embarrassed, and hesitatedfor some time, whether he should cause his troops to retire into thecamp. Then, as the enemy approached, he was sensible that his party,besides the losses which they suffered as they fled, must be entirelylost, if not speedily succoured; and as, by this time, even a retreatwould be unsafe, he found himself compelled to put all to hazard,before he was joined by the other division of his forces. He placedthe cavalry and light infantry that had been engaged, on the rightwing; and ordered the targeteers, and the phalanx of Macedonians,to lay aside their spears, which their great length renderedunserviceable, and to manage the business with their swords: at thesame time, that his line might not be easily broken, he lessened theextent of the front one half, and doubled the files within so that itmight be deeper than it was broad. He ordered them also to close theirfiles, so that man might join with man and arms with arms."Book 33,Chapter 9,"Quinctius, having received among the standards and ranks those whohad been engaged with the enemy, gave the signal by sound of trumpet.It is said, that such a shout was raised, as was seldom heard at thebeginning of any battle; for it happened, that both armies shoutedat once; not only the troops then engaged, but also the reserves, andthose who were just then coming into the field. The king, fightingfrom the higher ground, had the better on the right wing, by meanschiefly of the advantage of situation. On the left, all was disorderand confusion; particularly when that division of the phalanx, whichhad marched in the rear, was coming up. The centre stood intent on thefight as on a spectacle which in no way concerned them. The phalanx,just arrived (a column rather than a line of battle, and fitter fora march than for a fight,) had scarcely mounted the top of the hill:before these could form, Quinctius, though he saw his men in the leftwing giving way, charged the enemy furiously, first driving on theelephants against them, for he judged that one part being routedwould draw the rest after. The affair was no longer doubtful. TheMacedonians, repelled by the first shock of the elephants, instantlyturned their backs; and the rest, as had been foreseen, followed themin their retreat. Then, one of the military tribunes, forming hisdesign in the instant, took with him twenty companies of men; leftthat part of the army which was evidently victorious; and making asmall circuit, fell on the rear of the enemy's right wing. Any armywhatever, thus charged from the rear, must have been thrown intoconfusion. But to that confusion which under such circumstances wouldbe common to all armies, there was in this case an additional cause.The phalanx of the Macedonians, being heavy, could not readily faceabout; nor would they have been suffered to do it by their adversariesin front, who, although they gave way to them a little before, on thisnew occasion pressed them vigorously. Besides, they lay underanother inconvenience in respect of the ground; for, by pursuing theretreating enemy down the face of the hill, they had left the top tothe party who came round on their rear. Thus attacked on both sides,they were exposed for some time to great slaughter, and then betookthemselves to flight, most of them throwing away their arms."Book 33,Chapter 10,"Philip, with a small party of horse and foot, ascended a hillsomewhat higher than the rest, to take a view of the situation of histroops on the left. Then, when he saw them flying in confusion, andall the hills around glittering with Roman standards and arms,he withdrew from the field. Ouinctius, as he was pressing on theretreating enemy, observed the Macedonians suddenly raising up theirspears, and not knowing what they meant thereby, he ordered thetroops to halt. Then, on being told that this was the practice of theMacedonians when surrendering themselves prisoners, he was disposedto spare the vanquished; but the troops, not being apprized, either ofthe enemy having ceased fighting, or of the general's intention, madea charge on them, and the foremost having been cut down, the restdispersed themselves and fled. Philip hastened in disorderly flightto Temp, and there halted one day at Gonni, to pick up any whomight have survived the battle. The victorious Romans rushed into theMacedonian camp with hopes of spoil, but found it, for the most part,plundered already by the Aetolians. Eight thousand of the enemy werekilled on that day, five thousand taken. Of the victors, about sevenhundred fell. If any credit is to be attached to Valerius Antias, whoon every occasion exaggerates numbers enormously, the killed of theenemy on that day amounted to forty thousand; the prisoners taken, (inwhich article the deviation from truth is less extravagant,) to fivethousand seven hundred, with two hundred and forty-nine militarystandards. Claudius also asserts that thirty-two thousand of the enemywere slain, and four thousand three hundred taken. We have notgiven entire credit, even to the smallest of those numbers, but havefollowed Polybius, a safe authority with respect to all the Romanaffairs, but especially those which were transacted in Greece."Book 33,Chapter 11,"Philip having collected, after the flight, such as, having beenscattered by the various chances of the battle, had followed hissteps, and having sent people to Larissa to burn the records of thekingdom, lest they should fall into the hands of the enemy, retiredinto Macedonia. Quinctius set up to sale a part of the prisoners andbooty, and part he bestowed on the soldiers; and then proceeded toLarissa, without having yet received any certain intelligence to whatquarter Philip had betaken himself, or what were his designs. To thisplace came a herald from the king, apparently to obtain a truce, untilthose who had fallen in battle should be removed and buried, but inreality to request permission to send ambassadors. Both were obtainedfrom the Roman general; who, besides, added this message to the king,""not to be too much dejected."" This expression gave much offence,particularly to the Aetolians, who were become very assuming, and whocomplained, that ""the general was quite altered by success. Before thebattle, he was accustomed to transact all business, whether great orsmall, in concert with the allies; but they had, now, no share inany of his counsels; he conducted all affairs entirely by his ownjudgment; and was even seeking an occasion of ingratiating himselfpersonally with Philip, in order that, after the Aetolians hadlaboured through all hardships and difficulties of the war, the Romanmight assume to himself all the merit and all the fruits of a peace.""Certain it is, that he had treated them with less respect thanformerly, but they did not know why they were thus slighted. Theyimagined that he was actuated by an expectation of presents from theking, though he was of a spirit incapable of yielding to any suchpassion of the mind; but he was, with good reason, displeased at theAetolians, on account of their insatiable greediness for plunder,and of their arrogance in assuming to themselves the honour ofthe victory--a claim so ill founded, as to offend the ears of all.Besides, he foresaw that, if Philip were removed out of the way,and the strength of the kingdom of Macedonia entirely broken, theAetolians would necessarily be regarded as the masters of Greece.For these reasons, he intentionally did many things to lessen theirimportance and reputation in the judgment of the other states."Book 33,Chapter 12,"A truce for fifteen days was granted to the Macedonians, and aconference with the king himself appointed. Before the day arrived onwhich this was to be held, the Roman general called a council of theallies, and desired their opinions respecting the terms of peace,proper to be prescribed. Amynander, king of Athamania, delivered hisopinion in a few words; that ""the conditions of peace ought to beadjusted in such a manner, as that Greece might have sufficient power,even without the interference of the Romans, to maintain the peace,and also its own liberty."" The address of the Aetolians was moreharsh; for after a few introductory observations on the justice andpropriety of the Roman general's conduct, in communicating his plansof peace to those who had acted with him as allies in the war, theyinsisted, ""that he was utterly mistaken, if he supposed that hecould leave the peace with the Romans, or the liberty of Greece, on apermanent footing, unless Philip was either put to death or banishedfrom his kingdom; both which he could easily accomplish, if he choseto pursue his present success."" Quinctius, in reply, said, that ""theAetolians, in giving such advice, attended not either to the maxims ofthe Roman policy, or to the consistency of their own conduct. For,in all the former councils and conferences, wherein the conditions ofpeace were discussed, they never once urged the pushing of the war tothe utter ruin of the Macedonian: and, as to the Romans, besides thatthey had, from the earliest periods, observed the maxim of sparing thevanquished, they had lately given a signal proof of their clemencyin the peace granted to Hannibal and the Carthaginians. But, notto insist on the case of the Carthaginians, how often had theconfederates met Philip himself in conference, yet that it had neverbeen urged that he should resign his kingdom: and, because he hadbeen defeated in battle, was that a reason that their animosity shouldbecome implacable? Against an armed foe, men ought to engage withhostile resentment; towards the vanquished, the loftiest spirit wasever the most merciful. The kings of Macedonia were thought to bedangerous to the liberty of Greece. Suppose that kingdom and nationextirpated, the Thracians, Illyrians, and in time the Gauls, (nationsunsubjugated and savage,) would pour themselves into Macedonia first,and then into Greece. That they should not, by removing inconvenienceswhich lay nearest, open a passage to others greater and moregrievous."" Here he was interrupted by Phaeneas, praetor of theAetolians, who solemnly declared, that ""if Philip escaped now, hewould soon raise a new and more dangerous war."" On which Quinctiussaid,--""Cease wrangling, when you ought to deliberate. The king shallbe bound down by such conditions as will not leave it in his power toraise a war."""Book 33,Chapter 13,"The convention was then adjourned; and next day, the king cameto the pass at the entrance of Temp, the place appointed for aconference; and the third day following was fixed for introducing himto a full assembly of the Romans and allies. On this occasion Philip,with great prudence, intentionally avoided the mention of any of thoseconditions, without which peace could not be obtained, rather thansuffer them to be extorted after discussion; and declared, that he wasready to comply with all the articles which, in the former conference,were either prescribed by the Romans or demanded by the allies; and toleave all other matters to the determination of the senate. Althoughhe seemed to have hereby precluded every objection, even from themost inveterate of his enemies, yet, all the rest remaining silent,Phaeneas, the Aetolian, said to him,--""What! Philip, do you at lastrestore to us Pharsalus and Larissa, with Cremaste, Echinus, andThebes in Phthiotis?"" On Philip answering, that ""he would give noobstruction to their retaking the possession of them,"" a disputearose between the Roman general and the Aetolians about Thebes; forQuinctius affirmed, that it became the property of the Roman people bythe laws of war; because when, before the commencement of hostilities,he marched his army thither, and invited the inhabitants tofriendship, they, although at full liberty to renounce the king'sparty, yet preferred an alliance with Philip to one with Rome.Phaeneas alleged, that, in consideration of their being confederatesin the war, it was reasonable, that whatever the Aetolians possessedbefore it began, should be restored; and that, besides, there was, inthe first treaty, a provisional clause of that purport, by which thespoils of war, of every kind that could be carried or driven, were tobelong to the Romans; and that the lands and captured cities shouldfall to the Aetolians. ""Yourselves,"" replied Quinctius, ""annulled theconditions of that treaty, at the time when ye deserted us, and madepeace with Philip; but supposing it still remained in force, yet thatclause could affect only captured cities. Now, the states of Thessalysubmitted to us by a voluntary act of their own.""--These words wereheard by their allies with universal approbation; but to theAetolians they were both highly displeasing at the present, and provedafterwards the cause of a war, and of many great disasters attendingit. The terms settled with Philip were, that he should give hisson Demetrius, and some of his friends, as hostages; should pay twohundred talents[1] and send ambassadors to Rome, respecting the otherarticles: for which purpose there should be a cessation of arms forfour months. An engagement was entered into, that, in case the senateshould refuse to conclude a treaty, his money and hostages shouldbe returned to Philip. It is said, that one of the principal reasonswhich made the Roman general wish to expedite the conclusion of apeace, was, that he had received certain information of Antiochusintending to commence hostilities, and to pass over into Europe."Book 33,Chapter 14,"About the same time, and, as some writers say, on the same day,the Achaeans defeated Androsthenes, the king's commander, in a generalengagement near Corinth. Philip, intending to use this city as acitadel, to awe the states of Greece, had invited the principalinhabitants to a conference, under pretence of agreeing with them asto the number of horsemen which the Corinthians could supply towardsthe war, and these he detained as hostages. Besides the force alreadythere, consisting of five hundred Macedonians and eight hundredauxiliaries of various kinds, he had sent thither one thousandMacedonians, one thousand two hundred Illyrians, and of Thracians andCretans (for these served in both the opposite armies) eight hundred.To these were added Botians, Thessalians, and Acarnanians, to theamount of one thousand, all carrying bucklers; with as many of theyoung Corinthians themselves, as filled up the number of six thousandmen under arms,--a force which inspired Androsthenes with a confidentwish to decide the matter in the field. Nicostratus, praetor of theAchaeans, was at Sicyon, with two thousand foot and one hundred horse;but seeing himself so inferior, both in the number and kind oftroops, he did not go outside the walls: the king's forces, in variousexcursions, were ravaging the lands of Pellene, Phliasus, and Cleone.At last, reproaching the enemy with cowardice, they passed over intothe territory of Sicyon, and, sailing round Achaia, laid waste thewhole coast. As the enemy, while thus employed, spread themselvesabout too widely and too carelessly, (the usual consequence of toomuch confidence,) Nicostratus conceived hopes of attacking them bysurprise. He therefore sent secret directions to all the neighbouringstates, as to what day, and what number from each state, shouldassemble in arms at Apelaurus, a place in the territory of Stymphalia.All being in readiness at the time appointed, he marched thenceimmediately; and, without the knowledge of any one as to what he wascontemplating, came by night through the territory of the Phliasiansto Cleone. He had with him five thousand foot, of whom * * * * * * [1]were light-armed, and three hundred horse; with this force he waitedthere, having despatched scouts to watch on what quarter the enemyshould make their irregular inroads."Book 33,Chapter 15,"Androsthenes, utterly ignorant of all these proceedings, set outfrom Corinth, and encamped on the Nemea, a river running betweenthe confines of Corinth and Sicyon. Here, dismissing one half of histroops, he divided the remainder into three parts, and ordered all thecavalry of each part to march in separate divisions, and ravage,at the same time, the territories of Pellene, Sicyon, and Phlius.Accordingly, the three divisions set out by different roads. As soonas Nicostratus received intelligence of this at Cleone, he instantlysent forward a numerous detachment of mercenaries, to seize a passat the entrance into the territory of Corinth; and he himself quicklyfollowed, with his troops in two columns, the cavalry proceedingbefore the head of each, as advanced guards. In one column marchedthe mercenary soldiers and light infantry; in the other, theshield-bearers of the Achaeans and other states, who composed theprincipal strength of the army. Both infantry and cavalry were nowwithin a small distance of the camp, and some of the Thracians hadattacked parties of the enemy, who were straggling and scattered overthe country, when the sudden alarm reached their tents. The commanderwas thrown into the utmost perplexity; for, having never had a sightof the Achaeans, except occasionally on the hills before Sicyon,when they did not venture to come down into the plains, he hadnever imagined that they would come so far as Cleone. He ordered thestragglers to be recalled by sound of trumpet; commanded the soldiersto take arms with all haste; and, marching out of the gate at the headof thin battalions, drew up his line on the bank of the river. Hisother troops, having scarcely had time to be collected and formed, didnot withstand the enemy's first onset; the Macedonians had surroundedtheir standards in by far the greatest numbers, and now kept theprospect of victory a long time doubtful. At length, being leftexposed by the flight of the rest, and pressed by two bodies of theenemy on different sides, by the light infantry on their flank, and bythe shield-bearers and targeteers in front, and seeing victory declareagainst them, they at first gave ground; soon after, being vigorouslypushed, they turned their backs; and most of them, throwing away theirarms and having lost all hope of defending their camp, made the bestof their way to Corinth. Nicostratus sent the mercenaries in pursuitof these; and the auxiliary Thracians against the party employedin ravaging the lands of Sicyon: occasioned great carnage in bothinstances, greater almost than occurred in the battle itself. Of thosewho had been ravaging Pellene and Phlius, some, returning to theircamp, ignorant of all that had happened, and without any regularorder, fell in with the advanced guards of the enemy, where theyexpected their own. Others, from the bustle which they perceived,suspecting what was really the case, fled and dispersed themselves insuch a manner, that, as they wandered up and down, they were cutoff by the very peasants. There fell, on that day, one thousandfive hundred: three hundred were made prisoners. All Achaia was thusrelieved from their great alarm."Book 33,Chapter 16,"Before the battle at Cynoscephalae, Lucius Quinctius had invitedto Corcyra some chiefs of the Acarnanians, the only state in Greecewhich had continued to maintain its alliance with the Macedonians; andthere made some kind of scheme for a change of measures. Two causes,principally, had retained them in friendship with the king: one was aprinciple of honour, natural to that nation; the other, their fear andhatred of the Aetolians. A general assembly was summoned to meet atLeucas; but neither did all the states of Acarnania come thither, norwere those who did attend agreed in opinion. However, the magistratesand leading men prevailed so far, as to get a decree passed, thusprivately, for joining in alliance with the Romans. This gave greatoffence to those who had not been present; and, in this ferment ofthe nation, Androcles and Echedemus, two men of distinction among theAcarnanians, being commissioned by Philip, had influence enough in theassembly, not only to obtain the repeal of the decree for an alliancewith Rome, but also the condemnation, on a charge of treason, ofArchesilaus and Bianor, both men of the first rank in Acarnania, whohad been the advisers of that measure; and to deprive Zeuxidas, thepraetor, of his office, for having put it to the vote. The personscondemned took a course apparently desperate, but successful in theissue: for, while their friends advised them to yield to the necessityof the occasion, and withdraw to Corcyra, to the Romans, they resolvedto present themselves to the multitude; and either, by that act, tomollify their resentment, or endure whatever might befall them. Whenthey had introduced themselves into a full assembly, at first, amurmur arose, expressive of surprise; but presently silence tookplace, partly from respect to their former dignity, partly fromcommiseration of their present situation. Having been also permittedthe liberty of speaking, at first they addressed the assembly in asuppliant manner; but, in the progress of their discourse, when theycame to refute the charges made against them, they spoke with thatdegree of confidence which innocence inspires. At last, they evenventured to utter some complaints, and to charge the proceedingsagainst them with injustice and cruelty; and this had such an effecton the minds of all present, that, with one consent, they annulledall the decrees passed against them. Nevertheless, they came to aresolution, to renounce the friendship of the Romans, and return tothe alliance with Philip."Book 33,Chapter 17,"These decrees were passed at Leucas, the capital of Acarnania, theplace where all the states usually met in council. As soon, therefore,as the news of this sudden change reached the lieutenant-generalFlamininus, in Corcyra, he instantly set sail with the fleet forLeucas; and coming to an anchor at a place called Heraeus, advancedthence towards the walls with every kind of machine used in theattacking of cities; supposing that the first appearance of dangermight bend the minds of the inhabitants to submission. But seeing noprospect of effecting any thing, except by force, he began to erecttowers and sheds, and to bring up the battering-rams to the walls. Thewhole of Acarnania, being situated between Aetolia and Epirus, facestowards the west and the Sicilian sea. Leucadia, now an island,separated from Acarnania by a shallow strait which was dug by thehand, was then a peninsula, united on its eastern side to Acarnania bya narrow isthmus: this isthmus was about five hundred paces in length,and in breadth not above one hundred and twenty. At the entrance ofthis narrow neck stands Leucas, stretching up part of a hill whichfaces the east and Acarnania: the lower part of the town is level,lying along the sea, which divides Leucadia from Acarnania. Thus itlies open to attacks, both from the sea and from the land; for thechannel is more like a marsh than a sea, and all the adjacent groundis solid enough to render the construction of works easy. In manyplaces, therefore, at once the walls fell down, either undermined,or demolished by the ram. But the spirit of the besieged was asinvincible as the town itself was favourably situated for thebesiegers: night and day they employed themselves busily in repairingthe shattered parts of the wall; and, stopping up the breaches thatwere made, fought the enemy with great spirit, and showed a wish todefend the walls by their arms rather than themselves by the walls.And they would certainly have protracted the siege to a lengthunexpected by the Romans, had not some exiles of Italian birth, whoresided in Leucas, admitted a band of soldiers into the citadel:notwithstanding which, when those troops ran down from the higherground with great tumult and uproar, the Leucadians, drawing up in abody in the forum, withstood them for a considerable time in regularfight. Meanwhile the walls were scaled in many places; and thebesiegers, climbing over the rubbish, entered the town through thebreaches. And now the lieutenant-general himself surrounded thecombatants with a powerful force. Being thus hemmed in, many wereslain, the rest laid down their arms and surrendered to the conqueror.In a few days after, on hearing of the battle at Cynoscephalae,all the states of Acarnania made their submission to thelieutenant-general."Book 33,Chapter 18,"About this time, fortune, depressing the same party in everyquarter at once, the Rhodians, in order to recover from Phillip thetract on the continent called Peraea, which had been in possession oftheir ancestors, sent thither their praetor, Pausistratus, with eighthundred Achaean foot, and about one thousand nine hundred men, madeup of auxiliaries of various nations. These were Gauls, Nisuetans,Pisuetans, Tamians Areans from Africa, and Laodiceans from Asia. Withthis force Pausistratus seized by surprise Tendeba, in the territoryof Stratonice, a place exceedingly convenient for his purpose, withoutthe knowledge of the king's troops who had held it. A reinforcementof one thousand Achaean foot and one hundred horse, called out for thesame expedition, came up at the very time, under a commander calledTheoxenus. Dinocrates, the king's general, with design to recoverthe fort, marched his army first to Tendeba, and then to another fortcalled Astragon, which also stood in the territory of Stratonice.Then, calling in all the garrisons, which were scattered in manydifferent places, and the Thessalian auxiliaries from Stratoniceitself, he led them on to Alabanda, where the enemy lay. The Rhodianswere no way averse from a battle, and the camps being pitched neareach other both parties immediately came into the field. Dinocratesplaced five hundred Macedonians on his right wing, and the Agrianson his left; the centre he formed of the troops which he had drawntogether out of the garrisons of the forts; these were mostly Carians;and he covered the flanks with the cavalry, and the Cretan andThracian auxiliaries. The Rhodians had on the right wing the Achaeans;on the left mercenary soldiers; and in the centre a chosen band ofinfantry, a body of auxiliaries composed of troops of various nations.The cavalry and what light infantry they had, were posted on thewings. During that day both armies remained on the banks of a rivulet,which ran between them, and, after discharging a few javelins, theyretired into their camps. Next day, being drawn up in the same order,they fought a more important battle than could have been expected,considering the numbers engaged; for there were not more than threethousand infantry on each side, and about one hundred horse: but theywere not only on an equality with respect to numbers, and the kind ofarms which they used, but they also fought with equal spirit and equalhopes. First, the Achaeans crossing the rivulet, made an attack on theAgrians; then the whole line passed the river, almost at full speed.The fight continued doubtful a long time: the Achaeans, one thousandin number, drove back the four hundred from their position. Then theleft wing giving way, all exerted themselves against the right. Onthe Macedonians no impression could be made, so long as their phalanxpreserved its order, each man clinging as it were to another:but when, in consequence of their flank being left exposed, theyendeavoured to turn their spears against the enemy, who were advancingupon that side, they immediately broke their ranks. This first causeddisorder among themselves; they then turned their backs, and at last,throwing away their arms, and flying with precipitation, made the bestof their way to Bargylii. To the same place Dinocrates also made hisescape. The Rhodians continued the pursuit as long as the day lasted,and then retired to their camp. There is every reason to believe,that, if the victors had proceeded with speed to Stratonice, thatcity would have been gained without a contest; but the opportunity foreffecting this was neglected, and the time wasted in taking possessionof the forts and villages in Peraea. In the mean time, the courageof the troops in garrison at Stratonice revived; and shortly after,Dinocrates, with the troops which had escaped from the battle, cameinto the town, which, after that, was besieged and assaulted withouteffect; nor could it be reduced until a long time after that, whenAntiochus took it. Such were the events that took place in Thessaly,in Achaia, and in Asia, all about the same time."Book 33,Chapter 19,"Philip was informed that the Dardanians, in contempt of thepower of his kingdom, shaken as at that time it was, had passed thefrontiers, and were spreading devastation through the upper partsof Macedonia: on which, though he was hard pressed in almost everyquarter of the globe, fortune on all occasions defeating his measuresand those of his friends, yet, thinking it more intolerable than deathto be expelled from the possession of Macedonia, he made hasty leviesthrough the cities of his dominions; and, with six thousand foot andfive hundred horse, defeated the enemy by a surprise near Stobi inPaeonia. Great numbers were killed in the fight, and greater numbersof those who were scattered about in quest of plunder. As to such asfound a road open for flight, without having even tried the chanceof an engagement, they hastened back to their own country. After thisenterprise executed with a degree of success beyond what he met inthe rest of his attempts, and which raised the drooping courage of hispeople, he retired to Thessalonica. Seasonable as was the terminationof the Punic war, in extricating the Romans from the danger of aquarrel with Philip, the recent triumph over Philip happened stillmore opportunely, when Antiochus, in Syria, was already makingpreparations for hostilities. For besides that it was easier to wagewar against them separately than if both had combined their forcestogether, Spain had a little before this time, risen in arms in greatcommotion Antiochus, though he had in the preceding summer reducedunder his power all the states in Coele-Syria belonging to Ptolemy,and retired into winter quarters at Antioch, yet allowed himself norelaxation from the exertions of the summer. For resolving to exertthe whole strength of his kingdom, he collected a most powerful force,both naval and military; and in the beginning of spring, sendingforward by land his two sons, Ardues and Mithridates, at the head ofthe army, with orders to wait for him at Sardis, he himself set outby sea with a fleet of one hundred decked ships, besides two hundredlighter vessels, barks and fly-boats, designing to attempt thereduction of all the cities under the dominion of Ptolemy along thewhole coast of Caria and Cilicia; and, at the same time, to aid Philipwith an army and ships, for as yet that war had not been brought to aconclusion."Book 33,Chapter 20,"The Rhodians, out of a faithful attachment to the Roman people,and an affection for the whole race of the Greeks have performedmany honourable exploits, both on land and sea: but never was theirgallantry more eminently conspicuous than on this occasion, when,nowise dismayed at the formidable magnitude of the impending war,they sent ambassadors to tell the king, that he should not double thetribute of Cheledoniae, which is a promontory of Cilicia, renderedfamous by an ancient treaty between the Athenians and the kingof Persia; that if he did not confine his fleet and army to thatboundary, they would meet him there and oppose not out of any illwill, but because they would not suffice to join Philip and obstructthe Romans, who were resisting liberty to Greece. At this timeAntiochus was pushing the siege of Coracesium with his works; for,after he had possession of Zephyrium, Solae, Aphrodisias, and Corycus;and doubling Anemurium, another promontory of Cilicia, had takenSelinus; when all these, and the other fortresses on that coast, had,either through fear or inclination, submitted without resistance,Coracesium shut its gates, and gave him a delay which he did notexpect. Here an audience was given to the ambassadors of the Rhodians,and although the purport of their embassy was such as might kindlepassion in the breast of a king, yet he stifled his resentment, andanswered, that ""he would send ambassadors to Rhodes, and would givethem instructions to renew the old treaties, made by him and hispredecessors, with that state; and to assure them, that they need notbe alarmed at his approach; that it would involve no injury or fraudeither to them or their allies; for that he was not about to violatethe friendship subsisting between himself and the Romans, both his ownlate embassy to that people, and the senate's answers and decrees, sohonourable to him, were a sufficient evidence."" Just at that time hisambassadors happened to have returned from Rome, where they had beenheard and dismissed with courtesy, as the juncture required; theevent of the war with Philip being yet uncertain. While the king'sambassadors were haranguing to the above purpose, in an assembly ofthe people at Rhodes, a courier arrived with an account of the battleat Cynoscephalae having finally decided the fate of the war.Having received this intelligence, the Rhodians, now freed from allapprehensions of danger from Philip, resolved to oppose Antiochus withtheir fleet. Nor did they neglect another object that required theirattention; the protection of the freedom of the cities in alliancewith Ptolemy, which were threatened with war by Antiochus. For, somethey assisted with men, others by forewarning them of the enemy'sdesigns; by which means they enabled the Cauneans, Mindians,Halicarnassians, and Samians to preserve their liberty. It wereneedless to attempt enumerating all the transactions as they occurredin that quarter, when I am scarcely equal to the task of recountingthose which immediately concern the war in which Rome was engaged."Book 33,Chapter 21,"At this time king Attalus, having fallen sick at Thebes, had beencarried thence to Pergamus, died at the age of seventy-one after hehad reigned forty-four years. To this man fortune had given nothingwhich could inspire hopes of a throne except riches. By a prudent,and, at the same time, a splendid use of these, he begat, in himselffirst, and then in others, an opinion, that he was not undeserving ofa crown. Afterwards, having in one battle utterly defeated the Gauls,which nation was then the more terrible to Asia, as having but latelymade its appearance there, he assumed the title of king, and everafter exhibited a spirit equal to the dignity of that name. Hegoverned his subjects with the most perfect justice, and observed anunvarying fidelity towards his allies; gentle and bountiful to hisfriends; affectionate to his wife and four sons, who survived him; andhe left his government established on such solid and firm foundations,that the possession of it descended to the third generation. Whilethis was the posture of affairs in Asia, Greece, and Macedonia, thewar with Philip being scarcely ended, and the peace certainly not yetperfected, a desperate insurrection took place in the Farther Spain.Marcus Helvius was governor of that province. He informed the senateby letter, that ""two chieftains, Colca and Luscinus, were in arms;that Colca was joined by seventeen towns, and Luscinus by the powerfulcities of Carmo and Bardo; and that the people of the whole sea-coast,who had not yet manifested their disposition, were ready to rise onthe first motion of their neighbours."" On this letter being read byMarcus Sergius, city praetor, the senate decreed, that, as soon asthe election of praetors should be finished, the one to whose lot thegovernment of Spain fell should, without delay, consult the senaterespecting the commotions in that province."Book 33,Chapter 22,"About the same time the consuls came home to Rome, and, ontheir holding a meeting of the senate in the temple of Bellona, anddemanding a triumph, in consideration of their successes in the war,Caius Atinius Labeo, and Caius Ursanius, plebeian tribunes, insistedthat ""the consuls should propose their claims of a triumph separately,for they would not suffer the question to be put on both jointly,lest equal honours might be conferred where the merits were unequal.""Minucius urged, that they had both been appointed to the governmentof one province, Italy; and that, through the course of theiradministration, his colleague and himself had been united insentiments and in counsels; to which Cornelius added, that, when theBoians were passing the Po, to assist the Insubrians and Caenomaniansagainst him, they were forced to return to defend their own country,from his colleague ravaging their towns and lands. In reply thetribunes acknowledged, that the services performed in the war byCornelius were so great, that ""no more doubt could be entertainedrespecting his triumph than respecting the ascribing of glory to theimmortal gods."" Nevertheless they insisted, that ""neither he nor anyother member of the community should possess such power and influenceas to be able, after obtaining the honour that was due to himself, tobestow the same distinction on a colleague, who immodestly demandedwhat he had not deserved. The exploits of Quintus Minucius in Liguriawere trifling skirmishes, scarcely deserving mention; and in Gaulhe had lost great numbers of soldiers."" They mentioned even militarytribunes, Titus Juvencius and Cneius Labeo, of the fourth legion, theplebeian tribune's brother, who had fallen in unsuccessful conflict,together with many other brave men, both citizens and allies: andthey asserted, that ""pretended surrenders of a few towns and villages,fabricated for the occasion, had been made, without any pledge offidelity being taken."" These altercations between the consuls andtribunes lasted two days: at last the consuls, overcome by theobstinacy of the tribunes, proposed their claims separately."Book 33,Chapter 23,"To Cneius Cornelius a triumph was unanimously decreed: and theinhabitants of Placentia and Cremona added to the applause bestowedon the consul, by returning him thanks, and mentioning, to his honour,that they had been delivered by him from a siege; and that verymany of them, when in the hands of the enemy, had been rescued fromcaptivity. Quintus Minucius just tried how the proposal of his claimwould be received, and finding the whole senate averse from it,declared, that by the authority of his office of consul, and pursuantto the example of many illustrious men, he would triumph on theAlban mount. Caius Cornelius, being yet in office, triumphed overthe Insubrian and Caenomanian Gauls. He produced a great number ofmilitary standards, and earned in the procession abundance of Gallicspoils in captured chariots. Many Gauls of distinction were led beforehis chariot, and along with them, some writers say, Hamilcar, theCarthaginian general. But what, more than all, attracted the eyes ofthe public, was a crowd of Cremonian and Placentian colonists, withcaps of liberty on their heads, following his chariot. He carriedin his triumph two hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred_asses_,[1] and of silver denarii, stamped with a chariot,seventy-nine thousand.[2] He distributed to each of his soldiersseventy _asses_,[3] to a horseman and a centurion double that sum.Quintus Minucius, consul, triumphed on the Alban mount, over theLigurian and Boian Gauls. Although this triumph was less respectable,in regard to the place and the fame of his exploits, and because allknew the expense was not issued from the treasury; yet, in regard ofthe number of standards, chariots, and spoils, it was nearly equal tothe other. The amount of the money also was nearly equal. Two hundredand fifty-four thousand _asses_[4] were conveyed to the treasury, andof silver denarii, stamped with a chariot, fifty-three thousandtwo hundred.[5] He likewise gave to the soldiers, horsemen, andcenturions, severally, the same sums that his colleague had given."Book 33,Chapter 24,"After the triumph, the election of consuls came on. The personschosen were Lucius Furius Purpureo and Marcus Claudius Marcellus.Next day, the following were elected praetors; Quintus Fabius Buteo,Tiberius Sempronius Longus, Quintus Minucius Thermus, Manius AciliusGlabrio, Lucius Apustius Fullo, and Caius Laelius. Toward the close ofthis year, a letter came from Titus Quinctius, with information thathe had fought a pitched battle with Philip in Thessaly, and that thearmy of the enemy had been routed and put to flight. This letter wasread by Sergius, the praetor, first in the senate, and then, by thedirection of the fathers, in a general assembly; and supplicationsof five days' continuance were decreed on account of those successes.Soon after arrived the ambassadors, both from Titus Quinctius and fromthe king. The Macedonians were conducted out of the city to the VillaPublica, where lodgings and every other accommodation were providedfor them, and an audience of the senate was given them in the templeof Bellona. Not many words passed; for the Macedonians declared, thatwhatever terms the senate should prescribe, the king was readyto comply with them. It was decreed, that, conformably to ancientpractice, ten ambassadors should be appointed, and that, in councilwith them, the general, Titus Quinctius, should grant terms of peaceto Philip; and a clause was added, that, in the number of theseambassadors, should be Publius Sulpicius and Publius Villius, who intheir consulship had held the province of Macedonia. On the same daythe inhabitants of Oossa having presented a petition, praying that thenumber of their colonists might be enlarged; an order was accordinglypassed, that one thousand should be added to the list, with aprovision, that no persons should be admitted into that number who,at any time since the consulate of Publius Cornelius and TiberiusSempronius, had been partisans of the enemy."Book 33,Chapter 25,"This year the Roman games were exhibited in the circus, and onthe stage, by the curule aediles, Publius Cornelius Scipio and CneiusManlius Vulso, with an unusual degree of splendour, and were beheldwith the greater delight, in consequence of the late successes in war.They were thrice repeated entire, and the plebeian games seven times.These were exhibited by Manius Acilius Glabrio and Caius Laelius,who also, out of the money arising from fines, erected three brazenstatues, to Ceres, Liber, and Libera. Lucius Furius and MarcusClaudius Marcellus, having entered on the consulship, when thedistribution of the provinces came to be agitated, and the senateappeared disposed to vote Italy the province of both, exertedthemselves to get that of Macedonia put to the lot along with Italy.Marcellus, who of the two was the more eager for that province, byassertions that the peace was merely a feigned and delusive one, andthat, if the army were withdrawn thence, the king would renew the war,caused some perplexity in the minds of the senate. The consuls wouldprobably have carried the point, had not Quintus Marcius Rex and CaiusAntinius Labeo, plebeian tribunes, declared, that they wouldenter their protest, unless they were allowed, before any furtherproceeding, to take the sense of the people, whether it was their willand order that peace be concluded with Philip. This question was putto the people in the Capitol, and every one of the thirty-five tribesvoted on the affirmative side. The public found the greater reason torejoice at the ratification of the peace with Macedonia, as melancholynews was brought from Spain; and a letter was made public, announcingthat ""the proconsul, Caius Sempronius Tuditanus, had been defeated inbattle in the Hither Spain; that his army had been utterly routed anddispersed, and several men of distinction slain in the fight. ThatTuditanus, having been grievously wounded, and carried out of thefield, expired soon after."" Italy was decreed the province of bothconsuls, in which they were to employ the same legions which thepreceding consuls had; and they were to raise four new legions, twofor the city, and two to be in readiness to be sent whithersoeverthe senate should direct. Titus Quinctius Flamininus was orderedto continue in the government of his province, with the army of twolegions, then on the spot. The former prolongation of his command wasdeemed sufficient."Book 33,Chapter 26,"The praetors then cast lots for their provinces. Lucius ApustiusFullo obtained the city jurisdiction; Manius Acilius Glabrio, thatbetween natives and foreigners; Quintus Fabius Buteo, Farther Spain;Quintus Minucius Thermus, Hither Spain; Caius Laelius, Sicily;Tiberius Sempronius Longus, Sardinia. To Quintus Fabius Buteo andQuintus Minucius, to whom the government of the two Spains had fallen,it was decreed, that the consuls, out of the four legions raised bythem, should give one each whichever they thought fit, together withfour thousand foot and three hundred horse of the allies and Latinconfederates; and those praetors were ordered to repair to theirprovinces at the earliest possible time. This war in Spain broke outin the fifth year after the former had been ended, together with thePunic war. The Spaniards now, for the first time, had taken arms intheir own name, unconnected with any Carthaginian army or general.Before the consuls stirred from the city, however, they were ordered,as usual, to expiate the reported prodigies. Publius Villius, a Romanknight, on the road to Sabinia, had been killed by lightning, togetherwith his horse. The temple of Feronia, in the Capenatian district, hadbeen struck by lightning. At the temple of Moneta, the shafts oftwo spears had taken fire and burned. A wolf, coming in through theEsquiline gate, and running through the most frequented part ofthe city, down into the forum, passed thence through the Tuscan andMaelian streets; and scarcely receiving a stroke, made its escape outof the Capenian gate. These prodigies were expiated with victims ofthe larger kinds."Book 33,Chapter 27,"About the same time Cneius Cornelius Lentulus, who had held thegovernment of Hither Spain before Sempronius Tuditanus, entered thecity in ovation, pursuant to a decree of the senate, and carried inthe procession one thousand five hundred and fifteen pounds' weightof gold, twenty thousand of silver; and in coin, thirty-four thousandfive hundred and fifty denarii.[1] Lucius Stretinius, from the FartherSpain, without making any pretensions to a triumph, carried intothe treasury fifty thousand pounds' weight of silver; and out of thespoils taken, built two arches in the cattle-market, at the fronts ofthe temple of Fortune and Mother Matuta, and one in the great Circus;and on these arches placed gilded statues. These were the principaloccurrences during the winter. At this time Quinctius was in winterquarters at Elatia. Among many requests, made to him by the allies,was that of the Boeotians, namely, that their countrymen, who hadserved in the army with Philip, might be restored to them. Withthis Quinctius readily complied; not because he thought them verydeserving, but that, as king Antiochus was already suspected, hejudged it advisable to conciliate every state in favour of the Romaninterest. It quickly appeared how very little gratitude existed amongthe Boeotians; for they not only sent persons to give thanks to Philipfor the restoration of their fellows, as if that favour had beenconferred on them by him, and not by Quinctius and the Romans; but,at the next election, raised to the office of Boeotarch a man namedBrachyllas, for no other reason than because he had been commanderof the Boeotians serving in the army of Philip; passing by Zeuxippus,Pisistratus, and the others, who had promoted the alliance with Rome.These men were both offended at the present and alarmed about thefuture consequences: for if such things were done when a Roman armylay almost at their gates, what would become of them when the Romansshould have gone away to Italy, and Philip, from a situation so near,should support his own associates, and vent his resentment on thosewho had been of the opposite party?"Book 33,Chapter 28,"It was resolved, while they had the Roman army near at hand, totake off Brachyllas, who was the principal leader of the faction whichfavoured the king; and they chose an opportunity for the deed, when,after having been at a public feast, he was returning to his houseinebriated, and accompanied by some of his debauched companions,who, for the sake of merriment, had been admitted to the crowdedentertainment. He was surrounded and assassinated by six men, of whomthree were Italians and three Aetolians. His companions fled, cryingout for help; and a great uproar ensued among the people, who ranup and down, through all parts of the city, with lights; but theassassins made their escape through the nearest gate. At the firstdawn, a full assembly was called together in the theatre, by thevoice of a crier, as if in consequence of a previous appointment.Many openly clamoured that Brachyllas was killed by those detestablewretches who accompanied him; but their private conjectures pointedto Zeuxippus, as author of the murder. It was resolved, however, thatthose who had been in company with him should be seized and examinedin their presence. While they were under examination, Zeuxippus,with his usual composure, came into the assembly, for the purpose ofaverting the charge from himself; yet said, that people were mistakenin supposing that so daring a murder was the act of such effeminatewretches as those who were charged with it, urging many plausiblearguments to the same purpose. By which behaviour he led several tobelieve, that, if he were conscious of guilt, he would never havepresented himself before the multitude, or, without being challengedby any, have made any mention of the murder. Others were convincedthat he intended, by thus unblushingly exposing himself to the charge,to throw off all suspicion from himself. Soon after, those men whowere innocent were put to the torture; and, taking the universalopinion as having the effect of evidence, they named Zeuxippus andPisistratus; but they produced no proof to show that they knew anything of the matter. Zeuxippus, however, accompanied by a man namedStratonidas, fled by night to Tanagra; alarmed by his own consciencerather than by the assertion of men who were privy to no onecircumstance of the affair. Pisistratus, despising the informers,remained at Thebes. A slave of Zeuxippus had carried messagesbackwards and forwards, and had been intrusted with the management ofthe whole business. From this man Pisistratus dreaded a discovery; andby that very dread forced him, against his will, to make one. He senta letter to Zeuxippus, desiring him to ""put out of the way the slavewho was privy to their crime; for he did not believe him aswell qualified for the concealment of the fact as he was for theperpetration of it."" He ordered the bearer of this letter todeliver it to Zeuxippus as soon as possible; but he, not finding anopportunity of meeting him, put it into the hands of the very slavein question, whom he believed to be the most faithful to his master ofany; and added, that it came from Pisistratus respecting a matter ofthe utmost consequence to Zeuxippus. Struck by consciousness of guilt,the slave after promising to deliver the letter, immediately openedit; and, on reading the contents, fled in a fright to Thebes andlaid the information before the magistrate. Zeuxippus, alarmed by theflight of his slave, withdrew to Athens, where he thought he mightlive in exile with greater safety. Pisistratus, after being examinedseveral times by torture, was put to death."Book 33,Chapter 29," This murder exasperated the Thebans, and all the Boeotians, to themost rancorous animosity against the Romans, for they considered thatZeuxippus, one of the first men of the nation, had not been partyto such a crime without the instigation of the Roman general. Torecommence a war, they had neither strength nor a leader; but they hadrecourse to private massacres, as being next to war, and cut off manyof the soldiers, some as they came to lodge in their houses, others asthey wandered about their winter quarters, or were on leave of absencefor various purposes. Some were killed on the roads by parties lyingin wait in lurking-places; others were seduced and carried away toinns, which were left uninhabited, and there put to death. At lastthey committed these crimes, not merely out of hatred, but likewisefrom a desire of booty; for the soldiers on furlough generally carriedmoney in their purses for the purpose of trading. At first a few at atime, afterwards greater numbers used to be missed, until all Boeotiabecame notorious for those practices, and a soldier went beyond thebounds of the camp with more timidity than into an enemy's country.Quinctius then sent deputies round the states, to make inquiryconcerning the murders committed. The greatest number of murders werefound to have been committed about the lake called Copais; there thebodies were dug out of the mud, and drawn up out of the marsh, havinghad earthen jars or stones tied to them, so as to be dragged to thebottom by the weight. Many deeds of this sort were discovered to havebeen perpetrated at Acrphia and Coronea. Quinctius at first insistedthat the persons guilty should be given up to him, and that, for fivehundred soldiers, (for so many had been cut off,) the Botians shouldpay five hundred talents.[1] Neither of these requisitions beingcomplied with, and the states only making verbal apologies, declaring,that none of those acts had been authorized by the public; Quinctiusfirst sent ambassadors to Athens and Achaia, to satisfy the allies,that the war which he was about to make on the Botians was conformableto justice and piety; and then, ordering Publius Claudius tomarch with one-half of the troops to Acrphia, he himself, withthe remainder, invested Coronea; and these two bodies' marching bydifferent roads from Elatia, laid waste all the country through whichthey passed. The Botians, dismayed by these losses, while every placewas filled with fugitives, and while the terror became universal, sentambassadors to the camp; and as these were refused admittance, theAchaeans and Athenians came to their assistance. The Achaeans had thegreater influence as intercessors; inasmuch as they were resolved, incase they could not procure peace for the Botians, to join them inthe war. Through the mediation of the Achaeans, however, the Botiansobtained admission and an audience of the Roman general; who, orderingthem to deliver up the guilty, and to pay thirty talents[2] as a fine,granted them peace, and raised the siege."Book 33,Chapter 30,"A few days after this, the ten ambassadors arrived from Rome,in pursuance of whose counsel, peace was granted to Philip on thefollowing conditions: ""That all the Grecian states, as well those inAsia as those in Europe, should enjoy liberty, and their own laws:That from such of them as had been in the possession of Philip, heshould withdraw his garrisons, particularly from the following placesin Asia; Euromus, Pedasi, Bargylii, Iassus, Myrina, Abydus; and fromThasus and Perinthus, for it was determined that these likewise shouldbe free: That with respect to the freedom of Cius, Quinctius shouldwrite to Prusias, king of Bithynia, the resolutions of the senate, andof the ten ambassadors: That Philip should return to the Romansthe prisoners and deserters, and deliver up all his decked ships,excepting five and the royal galley,--of a size almost unmanageable,being moved by sixteen banks of oars: That he should not keep morethan five hundred soldiers, nor any elephant: That he should not wagewar beyond the bounds of Macedonia without permission from the senate:That he should pay to the Roman people one thousand talents:[1] onehalf at present, the other by instalments, within ten years."" ValeriusAntias writes, that there was imposed on him an annual tribute of fourthousand pounds' weight of silver, for ten years, and an immediatepayment of twenty thousand pounds' weight. The same author says thatan article was expressly inserted, that he should not make war onEumenes, Attalus's son, who had lately come to the throne. For theperformance of these conditions hostages were received, among whomwas Demetrius, Philip's son. Valerius Antias adds, that the island ofAegina, and the elephants, were given as a present to Attalus, who wasabsent; to the Rhodians, Stratonice, and other cities of Caria whichhad been in the possession of Philip; and to the Athenians, theislands of Paros, Imbros, Delos, and Scyros."Book 33,Chapter 31,"While all the other states of Greece expressed their approbationof these terms of peace, the Aetolians alone, in private murmurs, madesevere strictures on the determination of the ten ambassadors. Theysaid, ""it consisted merely of an empty piece of writing varnished overwith a fallacious appearance of liberty. For why should some citiesbe put into the hands of the Romans without being named, while otherswere particularized, and ordered to be enfranchised without suchconsignment; unless the intent was, that those in Asia, which, fromtheir distant situation, were more secure from danger, should be free;but those in Greece, not being even mentioned by name, should bemade their property: Corinth, Chalcis, and Oreum; with Eretria, andDemetrias."" Nor was this charge entirely without foundation: for therewas some hesitation with respect to Corinth, Chalcis, and Demetrias;because, in the decree of the senate in pursuance of which the tenambassadors had been sent from Rome, all Greece and Asia, except thesethree, were expressly ordered to be set at liberty; but, with regardto these, ambassadors were instructed, that, whatever measures theexigencies of the state might render expedient, they should determineto pursue in conformity to the public good and their own honour. KingAntiochus was one of whom they did not doubt that, so soon as he wassatisfied that his forces were adequate, he would cross over intoEurope; and they were unwilling to let these cities, the possessionof which would be so advantageous to him, lie open to his occupation.Quinctius, with the ten ambassadors, sailed from Elatia to Anticyra,and thence to Corinth. Here the plans they had laid down respectingthe liberation of Greece were discussed for about three days in acouncil of the ten ambassadors. Quinctius frequently urged, that""every part of Greece ought to be set at liberty, if they wishedto refute the cavils of the Aetolians; if they wished, that sincereaffection and respect for the Roman nation should be universallyentertained; or if they wished to convince the world that they hadcrossed the sea with the design of liberating Greece, and not oftransferring the sovereignty of it from Philip to themselves."" TheMacedonians alleged nothing in opposition to the arguments made use ofin favour of the freedom of the cities; but ""they thought it safer forthose cities themselves that they should remain, for a time, under theprotection of Roman garrisons, than be obliged to receive Antiochusfor a master in the room of Philip."" Their final determination was,that ""Corinth be restored to the Achaeans, but that a Roman garrisonshould continue in the citadel; and that Chalcis and Demetrias beretained, until their apprehensions respecting Antiochus shouldcease."""Book 33,Chapter 32,"The stated solemnity of the Isthmian games was at hand. These haveever been attended by very numerous meetings, as well on account ofthe universal fondness entertained by this nation for exhibitions ofskill in arts of every kind, as well as of contests in strengthand swiftness of foot; as also, because of the convenience of thelocality, which furnishes commercial advantages of all kinds by itstwo opposite seas, and by which it had obtained the character of arendezvous for all the population of Asia and Greece. But on thisoccasion, all were led thither not only for their ordinary purposes,but by an eager curiosity to learn what was thenceforward to be thestate of Greece, and what their own condition; while many at the sametime not only formed opinions within themselves but uttered theirconjectures in conversation. Scarcely any supposed that the Romans,victorious as they were, would withdraw from the whole of Greece.They took their seats, as spectators; and a herald, preceded bya trumpeter, according to custom, advanced into the centre of thetheatre, where notice of the commencement of the games is usuallymade, in a solemn form of words. Silence being commanded by sound oftrumpet, he uttered aloud the following proclamation: THE SENATE ANDPEOPLE OF ROME, AND TITUS QUINCTIUS, THEIR GENERAL, HAVING SUBDUEDKING PHILIP AND THE MACEDONIANS, DO HEREBY ORDER, THAT THE FOLLOWINGSTATES BE FREE, INDEPENDENT, AND RULED BY THEIR OWN LAWS: THECORINTHIANS, PHOCIANS, AND ALL THE LOCRIANS; THE ISLAND OF EUBOEA,AND THE MAGNESIANS; THE THESSALIANS, PERRHAEBIANS, AND THE ACHAEANS OFPHTHIOTIS. He then read a list of all the states which had been undersubjection to king Philip. The joy occasioned by hearing these wordsof the herald was so great, that the people's minds were unable toconceive the matter at once. Scarcely could they believe that they hadheard them; and they looked at each other, marvelling as at theempty illusion of a dream. Each inquired of his neighbours about whatimmediately concerned himself, altogether distrusting the evidenceof his own ears. As everyone desired not only to hear, but to see themessenger of liberty, the herald was called out again; and he againrepeated the proclamation. When they were thus assured of the realityof the joyful tidings, they raised such a shout, and clapping ofhands, and repeated them so often, as clearly to show that of allblessings none is more grateful to the multitude than liberty. Thegames were then proceeded through with hurry; for neither the thoughtsnor eyes of any attended to the exhibitions, so entirely had thesingle passion of joy pre-occupied their minds, as to exclude thesense of all other pleasures."Book 33,Chapter 33,"But, when the games were finished, every one eagerly passedtowards the Roman general; so that by the crowd rushing to onespot, all wishing to come near him, and to touch his right hand, andthrowing garlands and ribands, he was in some degree of danger. He wasthen about thirty-three years of age; and besides the vigour of youth,the grateful sensations excited by so eminent a harvest of glory,increased his strength. Nor was the general exultation exhausted inthe presence of all the assembly, but, through the space of many days,was continually revived by sentiments and expressions of gratitude.""There was a nation in the world,"" they said, ""which, at its ownexpense, with its own labour, and at its own risk, waged wars for theliberty of others. And this was performed, not merely for contiguousstates, or near neighbours, or for countries that made parts of thesame continent; but they even crossed the seas for the purpose, thatno unlawful power should subsist on the face of the whole earth; butthat justice, right, and law should every where have sovereign sway.By one sentence, pronounced by a herald all the cities of Greece andAsia had been set at liberty. To have conceived hopes of this, argueda daring spirit; to have carried it into effect, was a proof of themost consummate bravery and good fortune."""Book 33,Chapter 34,"Quinctius and the ten ambassadors then gave audience to theembassies of the several kings, nations, and states. First of all, theambassadors of king Antiochus were called. Their proceedings, here,were nearly the same as at Rome; a mere display of words unsupportedby facts. But the answer given them was not ambiguous as formerly,during the uncertainty of affairs, and while Philip was unsubdued; forthe king was required in express terms to evacuate the cities ofAsia, which had been in possession either of Philip or Ptolemy; not tomeddle with the free cities, or ever take arms against them, and tobe in a state of peace and equality with all the cities of Greecewherever they might be. Above all it was insisted on, that he shouldneither come himself into Europe, nor transport an army thither.The king's ambassadors being dismissed, a general convention ofthe nations and states was immediately held; and the business wasdespatched with the greater expedition, because the resolutions of theten ambassadors mentioned the several states by name. To the peopleof Orestis, a district of Macedonia, in consideration of their havingbeen the first who came over from the side of the king, their ownlaws were granted. The Magnesians, Perrhaebians, and Dolopians werelikewise declared free. To the nation of the Thessalians, besidesthe enjoyment of liberty, the Achaean part of Phthiotis was granted,excepting Phthiotian Thebes and Pharsalus. The Aetolians, demandingthat Pharsalus and Leucas should be restored to them in conformityto the treaty, were referred to the senate: but the council united tothese, by authority of a decree, Phocis and Locris, places which hadformerly been annexed to them. Corinth, Triphylia, and Heraea,another city of Peloponnesus, were restored to the Achaeans. The tenambassadors were inclined to give Oreum and Eretria to king Eumenes,son of Attalus; but Quinctius dissenting, the matter came under thedetermination of the senate, and the senate declared those citiesfree; adding to them Carystus. Lycus and Parthinia, Illyrian states,each of which had been under subjection to Philip, were given toPleuratus. Amynander was ordered to retain possession of the forts,which he had taken from Philip during the war."Book 33,Chapter 35,"When the convention broke up, the ten ambassadors, dividing thebusiness among them, set out by different routes to give liberty tothe several cities within their respective districts. Publius Lentuluswent to Bargylii; Lucius Stertinius, to Hephaestia, Thasus, andthe cities of Thrace; Publius Villius and Lucius Terentius to kingAntiochus; and Cneius Cornelius to Philip. The last of these, afterexecuting his commission with respect to smaller matters, askedPhilip, whether he was disposed to listen to advice, not only usefulbut highly salutary. To which the king answered that he was, and wouldgive him thanks besides, if he mentioned any thing conducive to hisadvantage. He then earnestly recommended to him, since he had obtainedpeace with the Romans, to send ambassadors to Rome to solicit theiralliance and friendship; lest, in case of Antiochus pursuing anyhostile measure, he might be suspected of having lain in wait andseized the opportunity of the times for reviving hostilities. Thismeeting with Philip was at Temp in Thessaly; and on his answeringthat he would send ambassadors without delay, Cornelius proceeded toThermopylae, where all the states of Greece are accustomed to meetin general assembly on certain stated days. This is called the Pylaicassembly. Here he admonished the Aetolians, in particular, constantlyand firmly to cultivate the friendship of the Roman people; but someof the principal of these interrupted him with complaints, that thedisposition of the Romans towards their nation was not the same sincethe victory, that it had been during the war; while others censuredthem with greater boldness, and in a reproachful manner asserted,that ""without the aid of the Aetolians, the Romans could neither haveconquered Philip, nor even have made good their passage into Greece.""To such discourses the Roman forbore giving an answer, lest thematter might end in an altercation, and only said, that if they sentambassadors to Rome, every thing that was reasonable would be grantedto them. Accordingly, they passed a decree for such mission, agreeablyto his direction.--In this manner was the war with Philip concluded."Book 33,Chapter 36,"While these transactions passed in Greece, Macedonia, and Asia,a conspiracy among the slaves had well nigh made Etruria an hostileprovince. To examine into and suppress this, Manius Acilius thepraetor, whose province was the administration of justice betweennatives and foreigners, was sent at the head of one of the two citylegions. A number of them, who were by this time formed in a body, hereduced by force of arms, killing and taking many. Some, who had beenthe ringleaders of the conspiracy, he scourged with rods and thencrucified; some he returned to their masters. The consuls repairedto their provinces. Just as Marcellus entered the frontiers of theBoians, and while his men were fatigued with marching the wholelength of the day, and as he was pitching his camp on a rising ground,Corolam, a chieftain of the Boians, attacked him with a very numerousforce, and slew three thousand of his men: several persons ofdistinction fell in that tumultuary engagement; amongst others,Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and Marcus Junius Silanus, praefects ofthe allies; and Aulus Ogulnius and Publius Claudius, military tribunesin the second legion. The Romans, not withstanding, had courage enoughto finish the fortification of their camp, and to defend it, in spiteof an assault made on it by the enemy, elated by their success in thefield. Marcellus remained for some time in the same post, until hecould tend the wounded, and revive the spirits of his men after sucha disheartening blow. The Boians, a nation remarkably impatient ofdelay, and quickly disgusted at a state of inaction, separated, andwithdrew to their several forts and villages. Marcellus then, suddenlycrossing the Po, led his legions into the territory of Comum, wherethe Insubrians, after rousing the people of the country to arms, layencamped. The fierce Boian Gauls attacked him on his march, and theyfirst onset was so vigorous, as to make a considerable impression onhis van. On perceiving which, and fearing lest, if his men once gaveway, they would be dislodged, he brought up a cohort of Marsiansagainst the enemy, and ordered every troop of the Latin cavalry tocharge them. The first and second charges of these having checked theenemy in their furious attack, the other troops in the Roman line,resuming courage, advanced briskly on the foe. The Gauls no longermaintained the contest, but turned their backs and fled in confusion.Valerius Antias relates, that in that battle above forty thousand menwere killed, five hundred and seven military standards taken, withfour hundred and thirty-two chariots, and a great number of goldchains, one of which, of great weight, Claudius says, was deposited asan offering to Jupiter, in his temple in the Capitol. The camp of theGauls was taken and plundered the same day; and the town of Comum wasreduced in a few days after. In a little time, twenty-eight forts cameover to the consul. There is a doubt among writers, whether the consulled his legions first against the Boians, or against the Insubrians;so as to determine, whether the successful battle obliterated thedisgrace of the defeat, or whether the victory obtained at Comum wastarnished by the disaster incurred among the Boii."Book 33,Chapter 37,"Soon after those matters had passed with such variety of fortune,Lucius Furius Purpureo, the other consul, came into the country of theBoians, through the Sappinian tribe. He proceeded almost to the fortof Mutilus, when, beginning to apprehend that he might be enclosedbetween the Boians and Ligurians, he marched back by the road by whichhe came; and, making a long circuit, through an open and thereforesafe country, arrived at the camp of his colleague. After thisjunction of their forces, they overran the territory of the Boians,spreading devastation as far as the city of Felsina. This city, withthe other fortresses, and almost all the Boians, excepting only theyoung men who kept arms in their hands for the sake of plunder, andhad at that time withdrawn into remote woods, made submission. Thearmy was then led away against the Ligurians. The Boians thought thatthe Romans, as they were supposed to be at a great distance, would bethe more careless in keeping their army together, and thereby affordan opportunity of attacking them unawares: with this expectation,they followed them by secret paths through the forests. They did notovertake them: and therefore, passing the Po suddenly in ships, theyravaged all the country of the Laevans and Libuans; whence, as theywere returning with the spoil of the country, they fell in with theRoman army on the borders of Liguria. A battle was begun with morespeed, and with greater fury, than if the parties had met with theirminds prepared, and at an appointed time and place. On this occasionit appeared to what degree of violence anger can stimulate men; forthe Romans fought with such a desire of slaughter, rather than ofvictory, that they scarcely left one of the enemy to carry the news oftheir defeat. On account of these successes, when the letters ofthe consuls were brought to Rome, a supplication for three days wasdecreed. Soon after, Marcellus came to Rome, and had a triumph decreedhim by an unanimous vote of the senate. He triumphed, while in office,over the Insubrians and Comans. The prospect of a triumph overthe Boians he left to his colleague, because his own arms had beenunfortunate in that country; those of his colleague, successful.Large quantities of spoils, taken from the enemy, were carried in theprocession in captured chariots, and many military standards; also,three hundred and twenty thousand _asses_ of brass,[1] two hundredand thirty-four thousand of silver denarii,[2] stamped with a chariot.Eighty _asses_[3] were bestowed on each foot soldier, and thrice thatvalue on each horseman and centurion."Book 33,Chapter 38,"During that year, king Antiochus, after having spent the winterat Ephesus, took measures for reducing, under his dominion, all thecities of Asia, which had formerly been members of the empire. As tothe rest, being either situated in plains, or having neither walls,arms, nor men in whom they could confide, he supposed they would,without difficulty, receive the yoke. But Smyrna and Lampsacus openlyasserted their independence: yet there was a danger that if what theyclaimed were conceded to these, the rest of the cities in Aetolia andIonia would follow the example of Smyrna; and those on the Hellespontthat of Lampsacus. Wherefore he sent an army from Ephesus to investSmyrna; and ordered the troops, which were at Abydos, to leave thereonly a small garrison, and to go and lay siege to Lampsacus. Nor didhe only alarm them by an exhibition of force. By sending ambassadors,to make gentle remonstrances, and reprove the rashness and obstinacyof their conduct, he endeavoured to give them hopes that they mightsoon obtain the object of their wishes; but not until it should appearclearly, both to themselves and to all the world, that they had gainedtheir liberty through the kindness of the king, and not by any violentefforts of their own. In answer to which, they said, that ""Antiochusought neither to be surprised nor displeased, if they did not verypatiently suffer the establishment of their liberty to be deferred toa distant period."" He himself, with his fleet, set sail from Ephesusin the beginning of spring, and steered towards the Hellespont. Hisarmy he transported to Madytus, a city in the Chersonese, and therejoined his land and sea forces together. The inhabitants having shuttheir gates, he surrounded the walls with his troops; and when he wasjust bringing up his machines to the walls, a capitulation was enteredinto. This diffused such fear through the inhabitants of Sestus andthe other cities of the Chersonese, as induced them to submit. Hethen came, with the whole of his united forces, by land and sea, toLysimachia; which finding deserted, and almost buried in ruins, (forthe Thracians had, a few years before, taken, sacked, and burnedit,) he conceived a wish to rebuild a city so celebrated, and socommodiously situated. Accordingly, extending his care to every objectat once, he set about repairing the walls and houses, ransomed someof the Lysimachians who were in captivity, sought out and brought homeothers, who had fled and dispersed themselves through the Chersoneseand Hellespontus, enrolled new colonists, whom he invited by prospectsof advantages, and used every means to repeople it fully. At the sametime, that all fear of the Thracians might be removed, he went, inperson, with one half of the land forces, to lay waste the nearestprovinces of Thrace; leaving the other half, and all the crews of theships, employed in the repairs of the city."Book 33,Chapter 39,"About this time Lucius Cornelius, who had been commissioned by thesenate to accommodate the differences between the kings Antiochus andPtolemy, stopped at Selymbria; and, of the ten ambassadors, PubliusLentulus from Bargylii, and Publius Villius and Lucius Terentius fromThasus, came to Lysimachia. Hither came, likewise, Lucius Corneliusfrom Selymbria, and a few days after Antiochus from Thrace. His firstmeeting with the ambassadors, and an invitation which he afterwardsgave them, were friendly and hospitable; but when the businessintrusted to them and the present state of Asia, came to be treatedof, the minds of both parties were exasperated. The Romans did notscruple to declare, that every one of his proceedings, from the timewhen he set sail from Syria, was displeasing to the senate; and theyrequired restitution to be made, to Ptolemy, of all the cities whichhad been under his dominion. ""For, as to what related to the citieswhich had been in the possession of Philip, and which Antiochus,taking advantage of a season when Philip's attention was turned to thewar with Rome, had seized into his own hands, it would surely be anintolerable hardship, if the Romans were to have undergone such toilsand dangers, on land and sea, for so many years, and Antiochus toappropriate to himself the prizes of the war. But, though his cominginto Asia might be passed over unnoticed by the Romans, as a matternot pertaining to them, yet when he proceeded so far as to pass overinto Europe with all his land and naval forces, how much was thisshort of open war with the Romans? Doubtless, had he even passed intoItaly, he would deny that intention. But the Romans would not wait togive him an opportunity of doing so."""Book 33,Chapter 40,"To this the king replied, that ""he wondered how it was, that theRomans were in the habit of diligently inquiring what ought to be doneby king Antiochus; but never considered how far they themselves oughtto advance on land or sea. Asia was no concernment of the Romans, inany shape; nor had they any more right to inquire what Antiochus didin Asia, than Antiochus had to inquire what the Roman people did inItaly. With respect to Ptolemy, from whom they complained that citieshad been taken, there was a friendly connexion subsisting between himand Ptolemy, and he was taking measures to effect speedily a connexionof affinity also; neither had he sought to acquire any spoils from themisfortunes of Philip, nor had he come into Europe against the Romans,_but to recover the cities and lands of the Chersonese, which, havingbeen the property of Lysimachus_,[1] he considered as part of his owndominion; because, when Lysimachus was subdued, all things belongingto him became, by the right of conquest, the property of Seleucus.That, at times, when his predecessors were occupied by cares ofdifferent kinds, Ptolemy first, and afterwards Philip, usurping therights of others, possessed themselves of several of these places, butwho could doubt that the Chersonese and the nearest parts of Thracebelonged to Lysimachus? To restore these to their ancient state, wasthe intent of his coming, and to build Lysimachia anew, (it havingbeen destroyed by an inroad of the Thracians,) in order that his son,Seleucus, might have it for the seat of his empire."""Book 33,Chapter 41,"These disputes had been carried on for several days, when a rumourreached them, but without any sufficiently certain authority, thatPtolemy was dead; which prevented the conferences coming to any issue:for both parties made a secret of their having heard it; and LuciusCornelius, who was charged with the embassy to the two kings,Antiochus and Ptolemy, requested to be allowed a short space of time,in which he could have a meeting with the latter; because he wishedto arrive in Egypt before any change of measures should take placein consequence of the new succession to the crown: while Antiochusbelieved that Egypt would be his own, if at that time he should takepossession of it. Wherefore, having dismissed the Romans, and lefthis son Seleucus, with the land forces, to finish the rebuilding ofLysimachia, as he had intended to do, he sailed, with his whole fleet,to Ephesus; sent ambassadors to Quinctius to treat with him about analliance, assuring him that the king would attempt no innovations,and then, coasting along the shore of Asia, proceeded to Lycia. Havinglearned at Patarae that Ptolemy was living, he dropped the design ofsailing to Egypt, but nevertheless steered towards Cyprus; and, whenhe had passed the promontory of Chelidonium, was detained some littletime in Pamphylia, near the river Eurymedon, by a mutiny among hisrowers. When he had sailed thence as far as the headlands, as they arecalled, of Sarus, such a dreadful storm arose as almost buried himand his whole fleet in the deep. Many ships were broken to pieces, andmany cast on shore; many swallowed so entirely in the sea, that notone man of their crews escaped to land. Great numbers of his menperished on this occasion; not only persons of mean rank, rowers andsoldiers, but even of his particular friends in high stations. When hehad collected the relics of the general wreck, being in no capacity ofmaking an attempt on Cyprus, he returned to Seleucia, with a far lessnumerous force than he had set out with. Here he ordered the shipsto be hauled ashore, for the winter was now at hand, and proceeded toAntioch, where he intended to pass the winter.--In this posture stoodthe affairs of the kings."Book 33,Chapter 42,"At Rome, in this year, for the first time, were created officescalled _triumviri epulones_;[1] these were Caius Licinius Lucullus,who, as tribune, had proposed the law for their creation, PubliusManlius, and Publius Porcius Laeca. These triumvirs, as well asthe pontiffs, were allowed by law the privilege of wearing thepurple-bordered gown. The body of the pontiffs had this year a warmdispute with the city quaestors, Quintus Fabius Labeo and LuciusAurelius. Money was wanted; an order having been passed for making thelast payment to private persons of that which had been raised for thesupport of the war; and the quaestors demanded it from the augurs andpontiffs, because they had not contributed their share while thewar subsisted. The priests in vain appealed to the tribunes; and thecontribution was exacted for every year in which they had not paid.During the same year two pontiffs died, and others were substitutedin their room: Marcus Marcellus, the consul, in the room of CaiusSempronius Tuditanus, who had been a praetor in Spain; and LuciusValerius, in the room of Marcus Cornelius Cethegus. An augur also,Quintius Fabius Maximus, died very young, before he had attained toany public office; but no augur was appointed in his place during thatyear. The consular election was then held by the consul Marcellus. Thepersons chosen were, Lucius Valerius Flaccus and Marcus Porcius Cato.Then were elected praetors, Caius Fabricius Luscinus, Caius AtiniusLabeo, Cneius Manlius Vulso, Appius Claudius Nero, Publius Manlius,and Publius Porcius Laeca. The curule aediles, Marcus Fulvius Nobiliorand Caius Flaminius, made a distribution to the people of one millionpecks of wheat, at the price of two asses. This corn the Sicilians hadbrought to Rome, out of respect to Caius Flaminius and his father;and he gave share of the credit to his colleague. The Roman gameswere solemnized with magnificence, and exhibited thrice entire. Theplebeian aediles, Cneius Domitius Aenobarbus and Caius Scribonius,chief curio, brought many farmers of the public pastures to trialbefore the people. Three of these were convicted; and out of the moneyaccruing from fines imposed on them, they built a temple of Faunus inthe island. The plebeian games were exhibited for two days, and therewas a feast on occasion of the games."Book 33,Chapter 43,"Lucius Valerius Flaccus and Marcus Porcius, on the ides of March,the day of their entering into office, consulted the senate respectingthe provinces; who resolved, that ""whereas the war in Spain was grownso formidable, as to require a consular army and commander; it wastheir opinion, therefore, that the consuls should either settlebetween themselves, or cast lots, for Hither Spain and Italy astheir provinces. That he to whom Spain fell should carry with him twolegions, five thousand of the Latin confederates, and five hundredhorse; together with a fleet of twenty ships of war. That the otherconsul should raise two legions; for these would be sufficient tomaintain tranquillity in the province of Gaul, as the spirits of theInsubrians and Boians had been broken the year before."" The lots gaveSpain to Cato, and Italy to Valerius. The praetors then cast lotsfor their provinces: to Caius Fabricius Luscinus fell the cityjurisdiction; Caius Atinius Labeo obtained the foreign; Cneius ManliusVulso, Sicily; Appius Claudius Nero, Farther Spain; Publius PorciusLaeca, Pisa, in order that he might be at the back of the Ligurians;and Publius Manlius was sent into Hither Spain, as an assistant tothe consul. Quinctius was continued in command for the year, asapprehensions were entertained, not only of Antiochus and theAetolians, but likewise of Nabis, tyrant of Lacedaemon; and it wasordered that he should have two legions, for which, if there was anynecessity for a further supply, the consuls were ordered to raiserecruits, and send them into Macedonia. Appius Claudius was permittedto raise, in addition to the legion which Quintius Fabius hadcommanded, two thousand foot and two hundred horse. The like number ofnew-raised foot and horse was assigned to Publius Manlius for HitherSpain; and the legion was given to him which had been under thecommand of Minucius, the praetor. To Publius Porcius Laeca, forEtruria, near Pisa, were decreed two thousand foot and five hundredhorse, out of the army in Gaul. Sempronius Longus was continued incommand in Sardinia."Book 33,Chapter 44,"The provinces being thus distributed, the consuls, before theirdeparture from the city, were ordered, in accordance with a decreeof the pontiffs, to proclaim a sacred spring, which Aulus CorneliusMammula, praetor, had vowed in pursuance of a vote of the senate, andan order of the people, in the consulate of Cneius Servilius and CaiusFlaminius. It was celebrated twenty-one years after the vow had beenmade. About the same time, Caius Claudius Pulcher, son of Appius,was chosen and inaugurated into the office of augur, in the room ofQuintus Fabius Maximus, who died the year before. While people, ingeneral, wondered that, though Spain had arisen in arms, they wereneglecting the war, a letter was brought from Quintus Minucius,announcing ""that he had fought a pitched battle with the Spanishgenerals, Budar and Besasis, near the town of Tura, and had gained thevictory: that twelve thousand of the enemy were slain; their general,Budar, taken; and the rest routed and dispersed."" After the reading ofthis letter less alarm prevailed with respect to Spain, where a veryformidable war had been apprehended. The whole anxiety of the publicwas directed towards king Antiochus, especially after the arrivalof the ten ambassadors. These, after relating the proceedings withPhilip, and the conditions on which peace had been granted him, gaveinformation, that ""there still subsisted a war of no less magnitude tobe waged with Antiochus; that he had come over into Europe with a verynumerous fleet and a powerful army; that, had not a delusive prospectof an opportunity of invading Egypt, raised by a more delusive rumour,diverted him to another quarter, all Greece would have quickly beeninvolved in the flames of war. Nor would even the Aetolians remainquiet, a race as well restless by nature as full of anger against theRomans. That, besides, there was another evil, of a most dangerousnature, lurking in the bowels of Greece: Nabis, tyrant at presentof Lacedaemon, but who would soon if suffered, become tyrant ofall Greece, equalling in avarice and cruelty all the tyrants mostremarkable in history. For, if he were allowed to keep possession ofArgos, which served as a citadel commanding the Peloponnesus, when theRoman armies should be brought home to Italy, Greece would have beenin vain delivered out of bondage to Philip; because, instead of thatking, who, supposing no other difference, resided at a distance, shewould have for a master, a tyrant, close to her side."""Book 33,Chapter 45,"On this intelligence being received from men of such respectableauthority, and who had, besides, examined into all the matters whichwere reported, the senate, although they deemed the business relatingto Antiochus the more important, yet, as the king had, for somereason or other, gone home into Syria, they thought that the affairrespecting the tyrant ought to be more promptly attended to. Afterdebating, for a long time, whether they should judge the grounds whichthey had at present sufficient whereon a declaration of war should bedecreed, or whether they should empower Titus Quinctius to act, in thecase respecting Nabis the Lacedaemonian, in such manner as he shouldjudge conducive to the public interest; they left it in his hands. Forthey thought the business of such a nature, that whether expedited ordelayed, it could not very materially affect the general interestof the Roman people. It was deemed more important to endeavour todiscover what line of conduct Hannibal and the Carthaginians wouldpursue, in case of a war breaking out with Antiochus. Persons of thefaction which opposed Hannibal wrote continually to their severalfriends, among the principal men in Rome, that ""messages and letterswere sent by Hannibal to Antiochus, and that envoys came secretly fromthe king to him. That, as some wild beasts can never be tamed, sothe disposition of this man was irreclaimable and implacable. Thathe sometimes complained, that the state was debilitated by ease andindolence, and lulled by sloth into a lethargy, from which nothingcould rouse it but the sound of arms."" These accounts were deemedprobable, when people recollected the former war, which had not morebeen carried on than at first set on foot by the efforts of thatsingle man. Besides, he had by a recent act provoked the resentment ofmany men in power."Book 33,Chapter 46,"The order of judges possessed, at that time, absolute power inCarthage; and this was owing chiefly to their holding the officeduring life. The property, character, and life of every man was intheir disposal. He who incurred the displeasure of one of that order,found an enemy in every one of them; nor were accusers wanting in acourt where the justices were disposed to condemn. While they werein possession of this despotism, (for they did not exercise theirexorbitant power constitutionally,) Hannibal was elected praetor andhe summoned the quaestor before him. The quaestor disregarded thesummons, for he was of the opposite faction; and besides, as thepractice was that, after the quaestorship men were advanced into theorder of judges, the most powerful of all, he already assumed a spiritsuited to the powers which he was shortly to possess. Hannibal, highlyoffended Hereat, sent an officer to apprehend the quaestor; and,bringing him forth into an assembly of the people, he made heavycharges not against him alone, but on the whole order of judges; inconsequence of whose arrogance and power neither the magistracy northe laws availed any thing. Then perceiving that his discourse waswith willing ears attended to, and that the conduct of those men wasincompatible with the freedom of the lowest classes, he proposed alaw, and procured it to be enacted, that the ""judges should beelected annually; and that no person should hold the office two yearssuccessively."" But, whatever degree of favour he acquired amongthe commons by this proceeding, he roused, in a great part of thenobility, an equal degree of resentment. To this he added another act,which, while it was for the advantage of the people, provoked personalenmity against himself. The public revenues were partly wasted throughneglect, partly embezzled, and divided among some leading men andmagistrates; insomuch, that there was not money sufficient for theregular annual payment of the tribute to the Romans, so that privatepersons seemed to be threatened with a heavy tax."Book 33,Chapter 47,"When Hannibal had informed himself of the amount of the revenuesarising from taxes and port duties, for what purposes they wereissued from the treasury, what proportion of them was consumed bythe ordinary expenses of the state, and how much was alienated byembezzlement; he asserted in an assembly of the people, that ifpayment were enforced of the residuary funds, the taxes might beremitted to the subjects; and that the state would still be richenough to pay the tribute to the Romans: which assertion he provedto be true. But now those persons who, for several years past, hadmaintained themselves by plundering the public, were greatly enraged;as if this were ravishing from them their own property, and not asdragging out of their hands their ill-gotten spoil. Accordingly, theyinstigated the Romans against Hannibal, who were seeking a pretextfor indulging their hatred against him. A strenuous opposition was,however, for a long time made to this by Scipio Africanus, whothought it highly unbecoming the dignity of the Roman people to makethemselves a party in the animosities and charges against Hannibal;to interpose the public authority among factions of the Carthaginians,not deeming it sufficient to have conquered that commander in thefield, but to become as it were his prosecutors[1] in a judicialprocess, and preferring an action against him. Yet at length the pointwas carried, that an embassy should be sent to Carthage to representto the senate there, that Hannibal, in concert with king Antiochus,was forming plans for kindling a war. Three ambassadors were sent,Caius Servilius, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, and Quintus TerentiusCulleo. These, when they had arrived at Carthage, by the advice ofHannibal's enemies, ordered, that any who inquired the cause oftheir coming should be told, that they came to determine the disputessubsisting between the Carthaginians and Masinissa, king of Numidia;and this was generally believed. But Hannibal was not ignorant that hewas the sole object aimed at by the Romans; and that, though theyhad granted peace to the Carthaginians, their war against him,individually, remained irreconcilable. He therefore determined togive way to fortune and the times; and having already made everypreparation for flight, he showed himself that day in the forum, inorder to guard against suspicion; and, as soon as it grew dark, wentin his common dress to one of the gates, with his two attendants, whoknew nothing of his intention."Book 33,Chapter 48,"Finding horses in readiness at a spot where he had ordered, hetraversed by night a district which the Africans denominated Byzacium,and arrived, in the morning of the following day, at a castle of hisown between Acholla and Thapsus. There a ship, ready fitted out andfurnished with rowers, took him on board. In this manner did Hanniballeave Africa, lamenting the misfortunes of his country oftener thanhis own. He sailed over, the same day, to the island of Cercina, wherehe found in the port a number of merchant ships, belonging to thePhoenicians, with their cargoes; and on landing was surrounded by aconcourse of people, who came to pay their respects to him; on whichhe gave orders that, in answer to any inquiries, it should be saidthat he had been sent as ambassador to Tyre. Fearing, however, lestsome of these ships might sail in the night to Thapsus or Adrumetum,and carry information of his having been seen at Cercina, he ordereda sacrifice to be prepared, and the masters of the ships, with themerchants, to be invited to the entertainment, and that the sails andyards should be collected out of the ships to form a shade on shorefor the company at supper, as it happened to be the middle of summer.The feast of the day was as sumptuous, and well attended, as the timeand circumstances allowed; and the entertainment was prolonged, withplenty of wine, until late in the night. As soon as Hannibal saw anopportunity of escaping the notice of those who were in the harbour,he set sail. The rest were fast asleep, nor was it early, next day,when they arose from their sleep, full of the illness of intoxication;and then, when it was too late, they set about replacing the sails inthe ships, and fitting up the rigging, which employed several hours.At Carthage, those who were accustomed to visit Hannibal met in acrowd, at the porch of his house; and when it was publicly known thathe was not to be found, the whole multitude assembled in the forum,eager to gain intelligence of the man who was considered as the firstin the state. Some surmised that he had fled, as the case was; others,that he had been put to death through the treachery of the Romans;and there was visible in the expression of their countenances, thatvariety which might naturally be expected in a state divided intofactions, whereof each supported a different interest. At lengthintelligence was brought, that he had been seen at Cercina."Book 33,Chapter 49,"The Roman ambassadors represented to the council, that ""proof hadbeen laid before the senate at Rome, that formerly king Philip hadbeen moved, principally by the instigation of Hannibal, to make war onthe Roman people; and that lately, Hannibal had, besides, sent lettersand messages to king Antiochus, that he had entered into plans fordriving Carthage to revolt, and that he had now gone no whither but toking Antiochus. That he was a man who would never be content, untilhe had excited war in every part of the globe. That such conduct oughtnot to be suffered to pass with impunity, if the Carthaginians wishedto convince the Roman people that none of those things were donewith their consent, or with the approbation of the state."" TheCarthaginians answered, that they were ready to do whatever the Romansrequired them.Hannibal, after a prosperous voyage, arrived at Tyre; where, as a manillustrated by every description of honours, he was received by thosefounders of Carthage, as if in a second native country, and here hestaid a few days. He then sailed to Antioch; where, hearing that theking had already left the place, he procured an interview with hisson, who was celebrating the solemnity of the games at Daphne, andwho treated him with much kindness; after which, he set sail withoutdelay. At Ephesus, he overtook the king, who was still hesitating inhis mind, and undetermined respecting a war with Rome: but thearrival of Hannibal proved an incentive of no small efficacy to theprosecution of that design. At the same time, the inclinations of theAetolians also were alienated from the Roman alliance in consequenceof the senate having referred to Quinctius their ambassadors, whodemanded Pharsalus and Leucas, and some other cities, in conformitywith the first treaty."Book 34,Chapter 1,"Amid the serious concerns of important wars, either scarcelybrought to a close or impending, an incident intervened, trivialindeed to be mentioned, but which, through the zeal of the partiesconcerned, issued in a violent contest. Marcus Fundanius and LuciusValerius, plebeian tribunes, proposed to the people the repealing ofthe Oppian law. This law, which had been introduced by Caius Oppias,plebeian tribune, in the consulate of Quintus Fabius and TiberiusSempronius, during the heat of the Punic war, enacted that ""no womanshould possess more than half an ounce of gold, or wear a garment ofvarious colours, or ride in a carriage drawn by horses, in a city,or any town, or any place nearer thereto than one mile; except onoccasion of some public religious solemnity."" Marcus and PubliusJunius Brutus, plebeian tribunes, supported the Oppian law, anddeclared, that they would never suffer it to be repealed; whilemany of the nobility stood forth to argue for and against the motionproposed. The Capitol was filled with crowds, who favoured or opposedthe law; nor could the matrons be kept at home, either by advice orshame, nor even by the commands of their husbands; but beset everystreet and pass in the city, beseeching the men as they went down tothe forum, that in the present flourishing state of the commonwealth,when the private fortune of all was daily increasing they would sufferthe women to have their former ornaments of dress restored. Thisthrong of women increased daily, for they arrived even from thecountry towns and villages; and they had at length the boldness tocome up to the consuls, praetors, and magistrates, to urge theirrequest. One of the consuls, however, they found especiallyinexorable--Marcus Porcius Cato, who, in support of the law proposedto be repealed, spoke to this effect:--"Book 34,Chapter 2,"""If, Romans, every individual among us had made it a rule tomaintain the prerogative and authority of a husband with respect tohis own wife, we should have less trouble with the whole sex. But now,our privileges, overpowered at home by female contumacy, are, evenhere in the forum, spurned and trodden under foot; and because we areunable to withstand each separately, we now dread their collectivebody. I was accustomed to think it a fabulous and fictitious tale,that, in a certain island, the whole race of males was utterlyextirpated by a conspiracy of the women. But the utmost danger may beapprehended equally from either sex, if you suffer cabals, assemblies,and secret consultations to be held: scarcely, indeed, can Idetermine, in my own mind, whether the act itself, or the precedentthat it affords, is of more pernicious tendency. The latter of thesemore particularly concerns us consuls, and the other magistrates:the former, yourselves, my fellow-citizens. For, whether the measureproposed to your consideration be profitable to the state or not, isto be determined by you, who are about to go to the vote. As to theoutrageous behaviour of these women, whether it be merely an act oftheir own, or owing to your instigations, Marcus Fundanius and LuciusValerius, it unquestionably implies culpable conduct in magistrates. Iknow not whether it reflects greater disgrace on you, tribunes, or onthe consuls: on you certainly, if you have, on the present occasion,brought these women hither for the purpose of raising tribunitianseditions; on us, if we suffer laws to be imposed on us by a secessionof women, as was done formerly by that of the common people. It wasnot without painful emotions of shame, that I, just now, made my wayinto the forum through the midst of a band of women. Had I not beenrestrained by respect for the modesty and dignity of some individualsamong them, rather than of the whole number, and been unwilling thatthey should be seen rebuked by a consul, I should have said to them,'What sort of practice is this, of running out into public, besettingthe streets, and addressing other women's husbands? Could noteach have made the same request to her husband at home? Are yourblandishments more seducing in public than in private; and with otherwomen's husbands, than with your own? Although if the modesty ofmatrons confined them within the limits of their own rights, it didnot become you, even at home, to concern yourselves about what lawsmight be passed or repealed here.' Our ancestors thought it notproper that women should perform any, even private business, withouta director; but that they should be ever under the control of parents,brothers, or husbands. We, it seems, suffer them, now, to interfere inthe management of state affairs, and to introduce themselves into theforum, into general assemblies, and into assemblies of election. For,what are they doing, at this moment, in your streets and lanes? What,but arguing, some in support of the motion of the plebeian tribunes;others, for the repeal of the law? Will you give the reins to theirintractable nature, and their uncontrolled passions, and then expectthat themselves should set bounds to their licentiousness, when youhave failed to do so? This is the smallest of the injunctions laid onthem by usage or the laws, all which women bear with impatience: theylong for liberty; or rather, to speak the truth, for unbounded freedomin every particular. For what will they not attempt, if they now comeoff victorious?"Book 34,Chapter 3,"""Recollect all the institutions respecting the sex, by whichour forefathers restrained their undue freedom, and by which theysubjected them to their husbands; and yet, even with the help of allthese restrictions, you can scarcely keep them within bounds. If,then, you suffer them to throw these off one by one, to tear them allasunder, and, at last, to be set on an equal footing with yourselves,can you imagine that they will be any longer tolerable by you? Themoment they have arrived at an equality with you, they will havebecome your superiors. But, forsooth, they only object to any newlaw being made against them: they mean to deprecate, not justice,but severity. Nay, their wish is, that a law which you have admitted,established by your suffrages, and confirmed by the practice andexperience of so many years to be beneficial, should now be repealed;that is, that, by abolishing one law, you should weaken all therest. No law perfectly suits the convenience of every member of thecommunity: the only consideration is, whether, upon the whole, it beprofitable to the greater part. If because a law proves obnoxious toa private individual, that circumstance should destroy and sweep itaway, to what purpose is it for the community to enact general laws,which those, with reference to whom they were passed, could presentlyrepeal? I should like, however, to hear what this important affairis which has induced the matrons thus to run out into public in thisexcited manner, scarcely restraining from pushing into the forum andthe assembly of the people. Is it to solicit that their parents, theirhusbands, children, and brothers may be ransomed from captivityunder Hannibal? By no means: and far be ever from the commonwealth sounfortunate a situation. Yet, even when such was the case, you refusedthis to their prayers. But it is not duty, nor solicitude for theirfriends; it is religion that has collected them together. Theyare about to receive the Idaean Mother, coming out of Phrygia fromPessinus! What motive, that even common decency will allow to bementioned, is pretended for this female insurrection? Why, say they,that we may shine in gold and purple; that, both on festal and commondays, we may ride through the city in our chariots, triumphing overvanquished and abrogated law, after having captured and wrested fromyou your suffrages; and that there may be no bounds to our expensesand our luxury."Book 34,Chapter 4,"""Often have you heard me complain of the profuse expenses of thewomen--often of those of the men; and that not only of men in privatestations, but of the magistrates: and that the state was endangered bytwo opposite vices, luxury and avarice; those pests, which havebeen the ruin of all great empires. These I dread the more, as thecircumstances of the commonwealth grow daily more prosperous andhappy; as the empire increases; as we have now passed over into Greeceand Asia, places abounding with every kind of temptation that caninflame the passions; and as we have begun to handle even royaltreasures: so much the more do I fear that these matters will bringus into captivity, rather than we them. Believe me, those statues fromSyracuse were brought into this city with hostile effect. I alreadyhear too many commending and admiring the decorations of Athens andCorinth, and ridiculing the earthen images of our Roman gods thatstand on the fronts of their temples. For my part I prefer thesegods,--propitious as they are, and I hope will continue to be, ifwe allow them to remain in their own mansions. In the memory ofour fathers, Pyrrhus, by his ambassador Cineas, made trial of thedispositions, not only of our men, but of our women also, by offers ofpresents: at that time the Oppian law, for restraining female luxury,had not been made; and yet not one woman accepted a present. What,think you, was the reason? That for which our ancestors made noprovision by law on this subject: there was no luxury existing whichneeded to be restrained. As diseases must necessarily be known beforetheir remedies, so passions come into being before the laws whichprescribe limits to them. What called forth the Licinian law,restricting estates to five hundred acres, but the unbounded desirefor enlarging estates? What the Cincian law, concerning gifts andpresents, but that the plebeians[1] had become vassals and tributariesto the senate? It is not therefore in any degree surprising, that nowant of the Oppian law, or of any other, to limit the expenses of thewomen, was felt at that time, when they refused to receive gold andpurple that was thrown in their way, and offered to their acceptance.If Cineas were now to go round the city with his presents, he wouldfind numbers of women standing in the public streets to receive them.There are some passions, the causes or motives of which I can noway account for. For that that should not be lawful for you whichis permitted to another, may perhaps naturally excite some degree ofshame or indignation; yet, when the dress of all is alike, why shouldany one of you fear, lest she should not be an object of observation?Of all kinds of shame, the worst, surely, is the being ashamed offrugality or of poverty; but the law relieves you with regard to both;since that which you have not it is unlawful for you to possess. Thisequalization, says the rich matron, is the very thing that I cannotendure. Why do not I make a figure, distinguished with gold andpurple? Why is the poverty of others concealed under this cover ofa law, so that it should be thought that, if the law permitted, theywould have such things as they are not now able to procure? Romans,do you wish to excite among your wives an emulation of this sort,that the rich should wish to have what no other can have; and thatthe poor, lest they should be despised as such should extend theirexpenses beyond their means? Be assured, that when a woman once beginsto be ashamed of what she ought not to be ashamed of, she will not beashamed of what she ought. She who can, will purchase out of her ownpurse; she who cannot, will ask her husband. Unhappy is the husband,both he who complies with the request, and he who does not; for whathe will not give himself, he will see given by another. Now, theyopenly solicit favours from other women's husbands; and, what is more,solicit a law and votes. From some they obtain them; although, withregard to yourself, your property, or your children, they would beinexorable. So soon as the law shall cease to limit the expenses ofyour wife, you yourself will never be able to do so. Do not supposethat the matter will hereafter be in the same state in which it wasbefore the law was made on the subject. It is safer that a wicked manshould even never be accused, than that he should be acquitted; andluxury, if it had never been meddled with, would be more tolerablethan it will be, now, like a wild beast, irritated by having beenchained, and then let loose. My opinion is, that the Oppian law ought,on no account, to be repealed. Whatever determination you may come to,I pray all the gods to prosper it."""Book 34,Chapter 5,"After him the plebeian tribunes, who had declared their intentionof protesting, added a few words to the same purport. Then LuciusValerius spoke thus in support of the measure which he himself hadintroduced:--""If private persons only had stood forth to argue for andagainst the proposition which we have submitted to your consideration,I for my part, thinking enough to have been said on both sides, wouldhave waited in silence for your determination. But since a person ofmost respectable judgment, the consul, Marcus Porcius, has reprobatedour motion, not only by the influence of his opinion, which, had hesaid nothing, would carry very great weight, but also in a long andcareful discourse, it becomes necessary to say a few words in answer.He has spent more words in rebuking the matrons, than in arguingagainst the measure proposed; and even went so far as to mention adoubt, whether the matrons had committed the conduct which he censuredin them spontaneously or at our instigation. I shall defend themeasure, not ourselves: for the consul threw out those insinuationsagainst us, rather for argument's sake than as a serious charge.He has made use of the terms cabal and sedition; and, sometimes,secession of the women: because the matrons had requested of you, inthe public streets, that, in this time of peace, when the commonwealthis flourishing and happy, you would repeal a law that was made againstthem during a war, and in times of distress. I know that these andother similar strong expressions, for the purpose of exaggeration, areeasily found; and, mild as Marcus Cato is in his disposition, yet inhis speeches he is not only vehement, but sometimes even austere. Whatnew thing, let me ask, have the matrons done in coming out into publicin a body on an occasion which nearly concerns themselves? Havethey never before appeared in public? I will turn over your ownAntiquities,[1] and quote them against you. Hear, now how often theyhave done the same, and always to the advantage of the public. In theearliest period of our history, even in the reign of Romulus, when theCapitol had been taken by the Sabines, and a pitched battle was foughtin the forum, was not the fight stopped by the interposition of thematrons between the two armies? When, after the expulsion of thekings, the legions of the Volscians, under the command of MarciusCoriolanus, were encamped at the fifth stone, did not the matrons turnaway that army, which would have overwhelmed this city? Again, whenRome was taken by the Gauls, whence was the city ransomed? Did notthe matrons, by unanimous agreement, bring their gold into the publictreasury? In the late war, not to go back to remote antiquity, whenthere was a want of money, did not the funds of the widows supply thetreasury? And when even new gods were invited hither to the relief ofour distressed affairs, did not the matrons go out in a body to thesea-shore to receive the Idaean Mother? The cases, you will say, aredissimilar. It is not my purpose to produce similar instances; it issufficient that I clear these women of having done any thing new. Now,what nobody wondered at their doing in cases which concerned all incommon, both men and women, can we wonder at their doing in a casepeculiarly affecting themselves? But what have they done? We haveproud ears, truly, if, though masters disdain not the prayers ofslaves, we are offended at being asked a favour by honourable women."Book 34,Chapter 6,"""I come now to the question in debate, with respect to which theconsul's argument is twofold: for, first, he is displeased at thethought of any law whatever being repealed; and then, particularly,of that law which was made to restrain female luxury. His formerargument, in support of the laws in general, appeared highly becomingof a consul; and that on the latter, against luxury, was quiteconformable to the rigid strictness of his morals. There is,therefore, a danger lest, unless I shall show what, on each subject,was inconclusive, you may probably be led away by error. For whileI acknowledge, that of those laws which are instituted, not for anyparticular time, but for eternity, on account of their perpetualutility, not one ought to be repealed; unless either experience evinceit to be useless, or some state of the public affairs render it so; Isee, at the same time, that those laws which particular seasons haverequired, are mortal, (if I may use the term,) and changeable with thetimes. Those made in peace are generally repealed by war; those madein war, by peace; as in the management of a ship, some implements areuseful in good weather, others in bad. As these two kinds are thusdistinct in their nature, of which kind does that law appear to bewhich we now propose to repeal? Is it an ancient law of the kings,coeval with the city itself? Or, what is next to that, was it writtenin the twelve tables by the decemvirs, appointed to form a code oflaws? Is it one, without which our ancestors thought that the honourof the female sex could not be preserved? and, therefore, have we alsoreason to fear, that, together with it, we should repeal the modestyand chastity of our females? Now, is there a man among you who doesnot know that this is a new law, passed not more than twenty yearsago, in the consulate of Quintus Fabius and Tiberius Sempronius? Andas, without it, our matrons sustained, for such a number of years,the most virtuous characters, what danger is there of their abandoningthemselves to luxury on its being repealed? For, if that law had beenpassed for the purpose of setting a limit to the passions of the sex,there would be reason to fear lest the repeal of it might operate asan incitement to them. But the real reason of its being passed,the time itself will show Hannibal was then in Italy, victorious atCannae: he already held possession of Tarentum, of Arpi, of Capua, andseemed ready to bring up his army to the city of Rome. Our allieshad deserted us. We had neither soldiers to fill up the legions, norseamen to man the fleet, nor money in the treasury. Slaves, who wereto be employed as soldiers, were purchased on condition of their pricebeing paid to the owners at the end of the war. The farmers of therevenues had declared, that they would contract to supply corn andother matters, which the exigencies of the war required, to be paidfor at the same time. We gave up our slaves to the oar, in numbersproportioned to our properties, and paid them out of our own incomes.All our gold and silver, in imitation of the example given by thesenators, we dedicated to the use of the public. Widows and minorslodged their money in the treasury. It was provided by law that weshould not keep in our houses more than a certain quantity of wroughtgold or silver, or more than a certain sum of coined silver or brass.At such a time as this, were the matrons so eagerly engaged inluxury and dress, that the Oppian law was requisite to repress suchpractices; when the senate, because the sacrifice of Ceres had beenomitted, in consequence of all the matrons being in mourning, orderedthe mourning to end in thirty days? Who does not clearly see, thatthe poverty and distress of the state, requiring that every privateperson's money should be converted to the use of the public, enactedthat law, with intent that it should remain in force so long only asthe cause of enacting the law should remain? For if all the decreesof the senate and orders of the people, which were then made to answerthe necessities of the times, are to be of perpetual obligation, whydo we refund their money to private persons? Why do we contract forpublic works for ready money? Why are not slaves brought to serve inthe army? Why do not we, private subjects, supply rowers as we didthen?"Book 34,Chapter 7,"""Shall, then, every other class of people, every individual, feelthe improvement in the condition of the state; and shall our wivesalone reap none of the fruits of the public peace and tranquillity?Shall we men have the use of purple, wearing the purple-bordered gownin magistracies and priests' offices? Shall our children wear gownsbordered with purple? Shall we allow the privilege of wearing the togapraetexta to the magistrates of the colonies and borough towns, andto the very lowest of them here at Rome, the superintendents of thestreets; and not only of wearing such an ornament of distinction whilealive, but of being buried with it when dead; and shall we interdictthe use of purple to women alone? And when you, the husband, may wearpurple in your great coat, will you not suffer your wife to have apurple mantle? Shall your horse be more splendidly caparisoned thanyour wife is clothed? But with respect to purple, which will be wornout and consumed, I can see an unjust, indeed, but still a sort ofreason, for parsimony; but with respect to gold, in which, exceptingthe price of the workmanship, there is no waste, what objection canthere be? It rather serves as a reserve fund for both public andprivate exigencies, as you have already experienced. He says therewill be no emulation between individuals, when no one is possessedof it. But, in truth, it will be a source of grief and indignation toall, when they see those ornaments allowed to the wives of the Latinconfederates of which they themselves have been deprived; when theysee those riding through the city in their carriages, and decoratedwith gold and purple, while they are obliged to follow on foot, asif the seat of empire were in the country of the others, not in theirown. This would hurt the feelings even of men, and what do you thinkmust be its effect on those of weak women, whom even trifles candisturb? Neither offices of state, nor of the priesthood, nortriumphs, nor badges of distinction, nor military presents, norspoils, can fall to their share. Elegance of appearance, andornaments, and dress, these are the women's badges of distinction; inthese they delight and glory; these our ancestors called the women'sworld. What else do they lay aside when in mourning, except their goldand purple? And what else do they resume when the mourning is over?How do they distinguish themselves on occasion of public thanksgivingsand supplications, but by adding unusual splendour of dress? But then,(it may be said,) if you repeal the Oppian law, should you choose toprohibit any of those particulars which the law at present prohibits,you will not have it in your power; your daughters, wives, and eventhe sisters of some, will be less under control. The bondage ofwomen is never shaken off without the loss of their friends; and theythemselves look with horror on that freedom which is purchased withthe condition of the widow or the orphan. Their wish is, that theirdress should be under your regulation, not under that of the law; andit ought to be your wish to hold them in control and guardianship, notin bondage; and to prefer the title of father or husband to that ofmaster. The consul just now made use of some invidious terms, callingit a female sedition and secession; because, I suppose, there isdanger of their seizing the sacred mount, as formerly the angryplebeians did; or the Aventine. Their feeble nature must submitto whatever you think proper to enjoin; and, the greater power youpossess, the more moderate ought you to be in the exercise of yourauthority."""Book 34,Chapter 8,"Although all these considerations had been urged against the motionand in its favour, the women next day poured out into public in muchgreater numbers, and in a body beset the doors of the tribunes who hadprotested against the measure of their colleagues; nor did they retireuntil this intervention was withdrawn. There was then no further doubtbut that every one of the tribes would vote for the repeal of the law.Thus was this law annulled, in the twentieth year after it hadbeen made. The consul Marcus Porcius, as soon as the Oppian law wasabolished, sailed immediately, with twenty-five ships of war, of whichfive belonged to the allies, to the port of Luna, where he ordered thetroops to assemble; and having sent an edict along the sea-coast, tocollect ships of every description, at his departure from Luna he leftorders that they should follow him to the harbour of Pyrenaeus, ashe intended to proceed thence against the enemy with his collectivefleet. They accordingly, after sailing by the Ligurian mountains andthe Gallic bay, congregated together on the day appointed. From thencethey went to Rhoda, and forcibly dislodged a garrison of Spaniardsthat were in that fortress. From Rhoda they proceeded with afavourable wind to Emporiae, and there landed all the forces,excepting the crews of the ships."Book 34,Chapter 9,"At that time, as at present, Emporiae consisted of two towns,separated by a wall. One was inhabited by Greeks from Phocaea, whencethe Massilians also derive their origin; the other by Spaniards. TheGreek town, being open towards the sea, had but a small extent ofwall, not above four hundred paces in circuit; but the Spanish town,being farther back from the sea, had a wall three thousand paces incircumference. A third kind of inhabitants was added by the deifiedCaesar settling a Roman colony there, after the final defeat of thesons of Pompey. At present they are all incorporated in one mass; theSpaniards first, and, at length, the Greeks; having been adoptedinto the Roman citizenship. Whoever had, at that period, observed theGreeks exposed on one side to the open sea, and on the other to theSpaniards, a fierce and warlike race, would have wondered by whatcause they were preserved. Deficient in strength, they guarded againstdanger by regular discipline; of which, among even more powerfulpeople, the best preservative is fear. That part of the wall whichfaced the country, they kept strongly fortified, having but one gate,at which some one of the magistrates was continually on guard. Duringthe night, a third part of the citizens kept watch on the walls,posting their watches, and going their rounds, not merely from theforce of custom, or in compliance with the law, but with as muchvigilance as if an enemy were at their gates. They never admittedany Spaniard into the city, nor did they go outside the walls withoutprecaution. The passage to the sea was open to every one: but, throughthe gate, next to the Spanish town, none ever passed, but in a largebody; these were generally the third division, which had watched onthe walls the preceding night. The cause of their going out was this:the Spaniards, ignorant of maritime affairs, were fond of traffickingwith them, and glad of an opportunity of purchasing, for their ownuse, the foreign goods, which the others imported in their ships; and,at the same time, of finding a market for the produce of their lands.The desire of this mutual intercourse caused the Spanish town to befreely open to the Greeks. They were thus the more protected as beingsheltered under the friendship of the Romans, which they cultivatedwith as much cordial zeal, though not possessed of equal resources,as the Massilians. On this account they received the consul, and hisarmy, with kindness and cordiality. Cato staid there a few days, untilhe could learn what force the enemy had, and where they lay; and, notto be idle during even that short delay, he spent the whole time inexercising his men. It happened to be the season of the year whenthe Spaniards had the corn in their barns. He therefore orderedthe purveyors not to purchase any corn, and sent them home to Rome,saying, that the war would maintain itself. Then, setting out fromEmporiae, he laid waste the lands of the enemy with fire and sword,spreading terror and flight through the whole country."Book 34,Chapter 10,"At the same time, as Marcus Helvius was going home from FartherSpain, with an escort of six thousand men, given him by the praetor,Appius Claudius, the Celtiberians, with a very numerous force, methim near the city of Illiturgi. Valerius says, that they had twentythousand effective men; that twelve thousand of them were killed, thetown of Illiturgi taken, and all the adult males put to the sword.Helvius, soon after, arrived at the camp of Cato; and as the regionwas now free from enemies, he sent back the escort to Farther Spain,and proceeded to Rome, where, on account of his successful services,he entered the city with an ovation. He carried into the treasury, ofsilver bullion, fourteen thousand pounds' weight; of coined, seventeenthousand and twenty-three denarii;[1] and Oscan[2] denarii, onehundred and twenty thousand four hundred and thirty-eight.[3] Thereason for which the senate refused him a triumph was, because hefought under the auspices, and in the province, of another. He hadreturned, moreover, two years after the expiration of his office,because after he had resigned the government of the province toQuintus Minucius, he was detained there during the succeeding year,by a severe and tedious sickness he therefore entered the city inovation, only two months before his successor, Quintus Minucius,enjoyed a triumph. The latter also brought into the treasurythirty-four thousand eight hundred pounds' weight of silver,seventy-eight thousand denarii,[4] and of Oscan denarii two hundredand seventy-eight thousand.[5]"Book 34,Chapter 11,"Meanwhile, in Spain, the consul lay encamped at a small distancefrom Emporiae. Thither came three ambassadors from Bilistages,chieftain of the Ilergetians, one of whom was his son, representing,that ""their fortresses were besieged and that they had no hopesof being able to hold out, unless the Roman troops came to theirassistance. Three thousand men,"" they said, ""would be sufficient;"" andthey added, that, ""if such a force came to their aid, the enemy wouldnot keep their ground."" To this the consul answered, that ""he wastruly concerned for their danger and their fears; but that he had byno means so great an amount of forces, as that, while there lay in hisneighbourhood such a powerful force of the enemy, with whom he dailyexpected a general engagement, he could safely diminish his strengthby dividing his troops."" The ambassadors, on hearing this, threwthemselves at the consul's feet, and with tears conjured him ""notto forsake them at such a perilous juncture. For, if rejected by theRomans, to whom could they apply? They had no other allies, no otherhope on earth. They might have escaped the present hazard, if they hadconsented to forfeit their faith, and to conspire with the rest; butno menaces, no appearances of danger, had been able to shake theirconstancy, because they hoped to find in the Romans abundant succourand support. If there was no further prospect of this, if it wasrefused them by the consul, they called gods and men to witness, thatreluctantly and under compulsion they must change sides, to avoid suchsufferings as the Saguntines had undergone; and that they would perishtogether with the other states of Spain, rather than alone."""Book 34,Chapter 12,"They were thus dismissed on that day without any positive answer.During the following night, the consul's thoughts were greatlyperplexed and divided. He was unwilling to abandon these allies, yetequally so to diminish his army, which might either oblige him todecline a battle, or occasion danger in an engagement. He was firmlyresolved, however, not to lessen his forces, lest he should in themean time suffer some disgrace from the enemy; and therefore hejudged it expedient, instead of real succour, to hold out hopes to theallies. For he considered that, in many cases, but especially in war,mere appearances have had all the effect of realities; and thata person, under a firm persuasion that he can command resources,virtually has them; that by that very confidence he was insured in hishopes and efforts. Next day he told the ambassadors, that ""althoughhe was afraid to lend a part of his forces to others, and so to weakenhis own, yet that he was giving more attention to their circumstancesand danger than to his own."" He then gave orders to the third partof the soldiers of every cohort, to make haste and prepare victuals,which they were to carry with them on board ships, and that thevessels should be got in readiness against the third day. He desiredtwo of the ambassadors to carry an account of these proceedings toBilistages and the Ilergetians; but, by kind treatment and presents,he prevailed on the chieftain's son to remain with him. Theambassadors did not leave the place until they saw the troops embarkedon board the ships; then reporting this at home as a matter ofcertainty, they spread, not only among their own people, but likewiseamong the enemy, a confident assurance of the approach of Romansuccours."Book 34,Chapter 13,"The consul, when a specious appearance had been sufficientlyexhibited, ordered the soldiers to be recalled from the ships; and, asthe season of the year now approached when it would be proper to enteron action, he pitched a winter camp at the distance of three milesfrom Emporiae. From this post he frequently led out his troops toravage the enemy's country; sometimes to one quarter, sometimes toanother, as opportunity offered, leaving only a small guard in thecamp. They generally began their march in the night, that they mightproceed as far as possible from the camp, and surprise the enemyunawares; and this practice disciplined the new-raised soldiers, andgreat numbers of the enemy were cut off; so that they no longer daredto venture beyond the walls of their forts. When he had made himselfthoroughly acquainted with the temper of the enemy, and of his ownmen, he ordered the tribunes and the praefects, with all the horsemenand centurions, to be called together, and addressed them thus: ""Thetime is arrived, which you have often wished for, when you might havean opportunity of displaying your valour. Hitherto you have waged warrather as marauders than as regular troops; you shall now meet yourenemies hand to hand, in regular fight. Henceforward you will haveit in your power, instead of pillaging country places, to exhaust thetreasures of cities. Our fathers, at a time when the Carthaginianshad in Spain both commanders and armies, and had themselves neithercommander nor soldiers there, nevertheless insisted on its being anarticle of treaty, that the river Iberus should be the boundary oftheir empire. Now, when two praetors of the Romans, when a consul, andthree armies are employed in Spain, and, for near ten years past, noCarthaginian has been in either of its provinces, yet we have lostthat empire on the hither side of the Iberus. This it is your duty torecover by your valour and arms; and to compel this nation, which isin a state rather of giddy insurrection than of steady warfare, toreceive again the yoke which it has shaken off."" After thus generallyexhorting them, he gave notice, that he intended to march by night tothe enemy's camp; and then dismissed them to take refreshment."Book 34,Chapter 14,"At midnight, after having given his attention to the auspices, hebegan his march, that he might take possession of such ground as hechose, before the enemy should observe him. Having led his troopsbeyond their camp, he formed them in order of battle, and at the firstlight sent three cohorts close to their very ramparts. The barbarians,surprised at the Romans appearing on their rear, ran hastily to arms.In the mean time, the consul observed to his men, ""Soldiers, you haveno room for hope, but in your own courage; and I have, purposely,taken care that it should be so. The enemy are between us and ourcamp; behind us is an enemy's country. What is most honourable, islikewise safest; namely, to place all our hopes in our own valour.""He then ordered the cohorts to retreat, in order to draw out thebarbarians by the appearance of flight. Every thing happened as he hadexpected. The enemy, thinking that the Romans retired through fear,rushed out of the gate, and filled the whole space between theirown camp and the line of their adversaries. While they were hastilymarshalling their troops, the consul, who had all his in readiness,and in regular array, attacked them when in disorder. He caused thecavalry from both wings to advance first to the charge: but those onthe right were immediately repulsed, and, retiring in disorder, spreadconfusion among the infantry also. On seeing this, the consul orderedtwo chosen cohorts to march round the right flank of the enemy, andshow themselves on their rear, before the two lines of infantry couldclose. The alarm which this gave the enemy, which had been thrown toa disadvantage by the cowardice of the Roman horse, restored the fightto an equality. But such a panic had taken possession of both thecavalry and infantry of the right wing, that the consul laid hold ofseveral with his own hand, and turned them about with their faces tothe enemy. As long as the fight was carried on with missile weapons,success was doubtful; and on the right wing, where the disorder andflight had first began, the Romans with difficulty kept their ground.On their left wing, the barbarians were both hard pressed in in front;and looked back, with timidity, at the cohorts that threatened theirrear. But when, after discharging their iron darts and large javelins,they drew their swords, the battle, in a manner, began anew. They wereno longer wounded by random blows from a distance, but, closing footto foot, placed all their hope in courage and strength."Book 34,Chapter 15,"When the consul's men were now spent with fatigue, he reanimatedtheir courage by bringing up into the fight some subsidiary cohortsfrom the second line. These formed a new front, and being freshthemselves, and with fresh weapons attacking the wearied enemy inthe form of a wedge, by a furious onset they first forced their waythrough them; and then, when they were once broken, scattered them andput them to flight. They returned towards their camp across the fieldswith all the speed they could make. When Cato saw the rout becomegeneral, he rode back to the second legion, which had been posted inreserve, and ordered the standards to be borne before it, and that itshould advance in quick motion, and attack the camp of the enemy. Ifany of them, through too much eagerness, pushed forward beyond hisrank, he himself rode up and struck them with his javelin, and alsoordered the tribunes and centurions to chastise them. By this time thecamp of the enemy was attacked, though the Romans were kept off fromthe works by stones, poles, and weapons of every sort. But, on thearrival of the fresh legion, the assailants assumed new courage, andthe enemy fought with redoubled fury in defence of their rampart. Theconsul attentively examined every place himself, that he might breakin at that quarter where he saw the weakest resistance. At a gate onthe left, he observed that the guard was thin, and thither he led thefirst-rank men and spearmen of the second legion. The party postedat the gate were not able to withstand their assault; while the rest,seeing the enemy within the rampart, abandoned the defence of thecamp, and threw away their standards and arms. Great numbers werekilled at the gates, being stopped in the narrow passages by thethrong of their own men; and the soldiers of the second legion cut offthe hindmost, while the rest were plundering the camp. According tothe account of Valerius Antias, there were above forty thousand ofthe enemy killed on that day. Cato himself, who was certainly nodisparager of his own merits, says that a great many were killed, buthe specifies no number."Book 34,Chapter 16,"The conduct of Cato on that day is judged deserving ofcommendation in three particulars. First, in leading round his army sofar from his camp and fleet, as to fight the battle in the very middleof the enemy, that his men might look for no safety but in theircourage. Secondly, in throwing the cohorts on the enemy's rear.Thirdly, in ordering the second legion, when all the rest weredisordered by the eagerness of their pursuit, to advance at a fullpace to the gate of the camp, in compact and regular order under theirstandards. He delayed not to improve his victory; but having sounded aretreat, and brought back his men laden with spoil, he allowed them afew hours of the night for rest; and then led them out to ravage thecountry. They spread their depredations the wider, as the enemy weredispersed in their flight; and this circumstance, no less than thedefeat of the preceding day, obliged the Spaniards of Emporiae,and those of their neighbourhood, to make a submission. Many also,belonging to other states, who had made their escape to Emporiae,surrendered; all of whom the consul received with kindness, and afterrefreshing them with victuals and wine, dismissed to their severalhomes. He quickly decamped thence, and wherever the army proceeded onits march, he was met by ambassadors, surrendering their respectivestates; so that, by the time when he arrived at Tarraco, all Spain onthis side of the Ebro was in a state of perfect subjection; and theRoman prisoners, and those of their allies and the Latin confederates,who by various chances had fallen into the hands of the enemies inSpain, were brought back by the barbarians, as an offering to theconsul. A rumour afterwards spread abroad, that Cato intended to leadhis army into Turditania; and it was given out, with equal falsehood,that he meant to proceed to the remote inhabitants of the mountains.On this groundless, unauthenticated report, seven forts of theBergistans revolted; but the Roman, marching thither, reduced themto subjection without any battle worthy of narration. Not very longafter, when the consul returned to Tarraco, and before he removedto any other place, the same persons revolted again. They wereagain subdued; but, on this second reduction, met not the same mildtreatment; they were all sold by auction, that they might not anyoftener disturb the peace."Book 34,Chapter 17,"In the mean time, the praetor, Publius Manlius, having receivedthe army from Quintius Minucius, whom he had succeeded, and joined toit the old army of Appius Claudius Nero, from Farther Spain, marchedinto Turditania. Of all the Spaniards, the Turditanians are reckonedthe least warlike; nevertheless, relying on their great numbers, theywent to oppose the march of the Romans. The cavalry, having been sentforward, at once broke their line; and with the infantry there washardly any conflict. The veteran soldiers, well acquainted with theenemy and their manner of fighting, effectually decided the battle.This engagement, however, did not terminate the war. The Turdulanshired ten thousand Celtiberians, and prepared to carry on the war withforeign troops. The consul, meanwhile, alarmed at the rebellion ofthe Bergistans, and suspecting that the other states would act inlike manner when occasion offered, took away their arms from all theSpaniards on this side of the Iberus; which proceeding affected themso deeply, that many laid violent hands on themselves; this fiercerace considering that, without arms, life was of no value. When thiswas reported to the consul, he summoned before him the senators ofevery one of the states, to whom he spoke thus: ""It is not more ourinterest than it is your own, that you should not rebel; since yourinsurrections have, hitherto, always drawn more mi fortune on theSpaniards than labour on the Roman armies. To prevent such thingshappening in future, I know but one method, which is, to put it outof your power to rebel. I wish to effect this in the gentlest way, andthat you would assist me therein with your advice. I will follow nonewith greater pleasure than what yourselves shall offer."" They allremaining silent, he told them that he would give them a few days'time to consider the matter. When, on being called together, even inthe second meeting, they uttered not a word, in one day he razed thewalls of all their fortresses; and marching against those who had notyet submitted, he received in every country, as he passed through,the submission of all the neighbouring states. Segestica alone, animportant and opulent city, he reduced by works and engines."Book 34,Chapter 18,"Cato had greater difficulties to surmount, in subduing the enemy,than had those commanders who came first into Spain; for this reason,that the Spaniards, through disgust at the Carthaginian government,came over to their side; whereas he had the task of enforcing theirsubmission to slavery, in a manner, after they had been in fullenjoyment of liberty. Besides, he found the whole province in astate of commotion; insomuch, that some were in arms, and others werecompelled to join in the revolt by being besieged, nor would theyhave been able to hold out any longer if they had not received timelysuccour. But so vigorous was the spirit and capacity of the consul,that there was no kind of business, whether great or small, which hedid not himself attend to and perform; and he not only planned andordered, but generally executed in person such measures as wereexpedient; nor did he practise a more strict and rigorous disciplineover any one than over himself. In spare diet, watching, and labour,he vied with the meanest of his soldiers; nor, excepting the honour ofhis post, and the command, had he any peculiar distinction above therest of the army."Book 34,Chapter 19,"The Celtiberians, summoned forth by the enemy for hire, as abovementioned, rendered the war in Turditania more difficult to thepraetor, Publius Manlius. The consul, therefore, in compliance with aletter from the praetor, led his legions thither. The Celtiberiansand Turditanians were lying in separate camps at the approach ofthe Romans, who began immediately to skirmish with the Turditanians,making attacks on their advanced guards; and they constantly cameoff victorious from every engagement, however rashly undertaken. Theconsul ordered some military tribunes to enter into a conference withthe Celtiberians, and to offer them their choice of three proposals:first, to come over, if they wished it, to the Romans, and receivedouble the pay for which they had agreed with the Turditanians: thesecond, to depart to their own homes, on receiving assurance, underthe sanction of the public faith, that it should not operate to theirinjury that they had joined the enemies of the Romans: the third was,that, if they were absolutely determined on war, they should appoint aday and place to decide the matter with him by arms. The Celtiberiansdesired a day's time for consideration; and an assembly was held, butin great confusion, from the Turditanians mingling in it, so that noresolution could be come to. Although it was uncertain whetherthere was to be war or peace with the Celtiberians, the Romans,nevertheless, just as though the latter were determined on, broughtprovisions from the lands and forts of the enemy, and soon venturedto go within their fortifications, relying on private truces, asthey would on a common intercourse established by authority. When theconsul found that he could not entice the enemy to a battle, he firstled out a number of cohorts, lightly accoutred, in regular order, toravage a part of the country which was yet unhurt; then hearing thatall the baggage of the Celtiberians was deposited at Saguntia,he proceeded thither to attack that town, but was unable,notwithstanding, to provoke them to stir. Paying, therefore, his owntroops and those of Minucius, he left the bulk of his army in thepraetor's camp, and, with seven cohorts, returned to the Iberus."Book 34,Chapter 20,"With that small force he took several towns. The Sidetonians,Ausetanians, and Suessetanians came over to his side. The Lacetanians,a remote and wild nation, still remained in arms; partly through theirnatural ferocity, and partly through consciousness of guilt, in havinglaid waste, by sudden incursions, the country of the allies, while theconsul and his army were employed in the war with the Turditanians.He therefore marched to attack their capital, not only with the Romancohorts, but also with the troops of the allies, who were justlyincensed against them. The town was stretched out into considerablelength, but had not proportionable breadth. At the distance of aboutfour hundred paces from it he halted, and leaving there a partycomposed of chosen cohorts, he charged them not to stir from that spotuntil he himself should come to them; and then he led round the restof the men to the farther side of the town. The greater part of hisauxiliary troops were Suessetanians, and these he ordered to advanceand assault the wall. The Lacetanians, knowing their arms andstandards, and remembering how often they had themselves, withimpunity, committed every kind of outrage and insult in theirterritory, how often defeated and routed them in pitched battles,hastily threw open a gate, and all, in one body, rushed out againstthem. The Suessetanians scarcely stood their shout, much less theironset; and the consul, on seeing this happen, just as he had foreseen,galloped back under the enemy's wall to his cohorts, brought them upquickly to that part of the city where all was silence and solitude,in consequence of the Lacetanians having sallied out on theSuessetanians, and took possession of every part of it before theLacetanians returned; who, having nothing now left but their arms,soon surrendered themselves also."Book 34,Chapter 21,"The conqueror marched thence, without delay, to the fort ofVergium. This was, almost entirely, a receptacle of robbers andplunderers, and thence incursions were made on the peaceable partsof the province. One of the principal inhabitants deserted out ofthe place to the consul, and endeavoured to excuse himself and hiscountrymen; alleging, that ""the management of affairs was not in theirhands; for the robbers, having gained admittance, had reduced thefort entirely under their own power."" The consul ordered him to returnhome, and pretend some plausible reason for having been absent; andthen, ""when he should see him advancing to the walls, and the robbersintent on defending the city, to seize the citadel with such men asfavoured his party."" This was executed according to his directions.The double alarm, from the Romans scaling the walls in front, and thecitadel being seized on their rear, at once entirely confounded thebarbarians. The consul, having taken possession of the place, ordered,that those who had secured the citadel should, with their relations,be set at liberty, and enjoy their property, the rest of the nativeshe commanded the quaestor to sell; and he put the robbers to death.Having restored quiet in the province, he settled the iron and silvermines on such a footing, that they produced a large revenue; and, inconsequence of the regulations then made, the province daily increasedin riches. On account of these services performed in Spain, the senatedecreed a supplication for three days."Book 34,Chapter 22,"During this summer, the other consul, Lucius Valerius Flaccus,fought a pitched battle with a body of the Boians in Gaul, near theforest of Litanae, and gained a complete victory. Eight thousandof the Gauls are said to have been slain; the rest, desisting fromfurther opposition, retired quietly to their several villages andlands. During the remainder of the summer, the consul kept his armynear the Po, at Placentia and Cremona, and repaired the buildings inthese cities which had been demolished in the war. While the affairsof Italy and Spain were in this posture, Titus Quinctius had spent thewinter in Greece, in such a manner, that excepting the Aetolians, whoneither had gained rewards of victory adequate to their hopes, norwere capable of being long contented with a state of quiet, allGreece, being in full enjoyment of the blessings of peace and liberty,were highly pleased with their present state; and they admirednot more the Roman general's bravery in arms, than his temperance,justice, and moderation in victory. And now a decree of the senatewas brought to him, containing a denunciation of war against Nabisthe Lacedaemonian. On reading it, Quinctius summoned a convention ofdeputies from all the allied states, to be held, on a certain day, atCorinth. Whither when many persons of the first rank came together,from all quarters, forming a very full assembly, from which even theAetolians were not absent, he addressed them in this manner:--""TheRomans and Greeks, in the war which they waged against Philip, wereunited in affections and councils, and they had each no less theirseparate reasons for entering into it. For he had violated friendshipwith the Romans; first by aiding our enemies, the Carthaginians; andthen by attacking our allies here: and, towards you, his conduct wassuch, that even if we had been willing to forget our own injuries,those offered by him to you would have constituted a sufficientoccasion of war. But the business to be considered this day hasrelation wholly to yourselves: for the subject which I propose to yourconsideration is, whether you choose to suffer Argos, which, as youknow, has been seized by Nabis, to remain under his dominion; orwhether you judge it reasonable, that a city of such high reputationand antiquity, seated in the centre of Greece, should be restored toliberty, and placed in the same state with the rest of the cities ofPeloponnesus and of Greece. This question, as you see, merely respectsyourselves; it concerns not the Romans in any decree, excepting sofar as the one city being left in subjection to tyranny hinders theirglory, in having liberated Greece, from being full and complete.If, however, you are not moved by regard for that city, nor by theexample, nor by the danger of the contagion of that evil spreadingwider, we, for our parts, shall rest content. On this subject I desireyour opinions, resolved to abide by whatever the majority of you shalldetermine."""Book 34,Chapter 23,"After the address of the Roman general, the several deputiesproceeded to give their opinions. The ambassador of the Atheniansextolled, to the utmost of his power, and expressed the greatestgratitude for the kindness of the Romans towards Greece, ""in having,when applied to for assistance, brought them succours against Philip;and now, without being applied to, voluntarily offering assistanceagainst the tyrant Nabis."" He at the same time severely censuredthe conduct of some, who, in their discourses, ""depreciated thosekindnesses, and propagated evil surmises of the future, when it wouldbetter become them rather to return thanks for the past."" It wasevident that this was pointed at the Aetolians: wherefore Alexander,deputy of that nation, having first inveighed against the Athenians,who, having formerly been the most strenuous supporters of liberty,now betrayed the general cause, for the sake of recommendingthemselves by flattery. He then complained that ""the Achaeans,formerly soldiers of Philip, and lately, on the decline of hisfortune, deserters from him, had regained possession of Corinth, andwere so acting as that they might acquire Argos; while the Aetolians,who had first opposed their arms to Philip, who had always beenallies of the Romans, and who had stipulated by treaty, that, on theMacedonian being conquered, the lands and cities should be theirs,were defrauded of Echinus and Pharsalus."" He charged the Romans withinsincerity, because, ""while they put forth empty professions ofestablishing liberty, they held possession of Demetrias and Chalcisby their garrisons; though, when Philip hesitated to withdraw hisgarrisons from those places, they always urged against him that theGrecians would never be free while Demetrias, Chalcis, and Corinthwere in the hands of the others. And, lastly, that they named Argosand Nabis merely as a pretext for remaining in Greece, and keepingtheir armies there. Let them carry away their legions to Italy;and the Aetolians were ready to undertake, either that Nabis shouldvoluntarily withdraw his forces from Argos, on terms; or they wouldcompel him by force of arms to comply with the unanimous judgment ofGreece."""Book 34,Chapter 24,"This arrogant speech called up, first, Aristaenus, praetor of theAchaeans, who said:--""Forbid it, Jupiter, supremely good and great,and imperial Juno, the tutelar deity of Argos, that that city shouldbe staked as a prize between the Lacedaemonian tyrant and the Aetolianplunderers, under such unhappy circumstances, that its being retakenby you should be productive of more calamitous consequences than itscapture by him. Titus Quinctius, the sea lying between us, does notsecure us from those robbers; what then will become of us, should theyprocure themselves a stronghold in the centre of Peloponnesus? Theyhave nothing Grecian but the language, as they have nothing human butthe shape. They live under customs and rites more brutally savage thanany barbarians, nay, than wild beasts themselves. Wherefore, Romans,we beseech you, not only to recover Argos from Nabis, but also toestablish the affairs of Greece on such a footing, as to leave thesecountries adequately secured from the robberies of the Aetolians."" Therest concurring in these censures on the Aetolians, the Roman generalsaid, that ""he had himself intended to have answered them, but thathe perceived all so highly incensed against those people, that thegeneral resentment required rather to be appeased than irritated.Satisfied, therefore, with the sentiments entertained of the Romans,and of the Aetolians, he would simply put this question: What was thegeneral opinion concerning war with Nabis, in case of his refusing torestore Argos to the Achaeans?"" When all had pronounced for war, herecommended to them, to send in their shares of auxiliary troops, eachstate in proportion to its ability. He even sent an ambassador to theAetolians; rather to make them disclose their sentiments, which wasthe actual result, than with any hope of obtaining their concurrence.He gave orders to the military tribunes, to bring up the army fromElatia. To the ambassadors of Antiochus, who, at this time, proposedto treat of an alliance, he answered, that ""he could say nothing onthe subject in the absence of the ten ambassadors. They must go toRome, and apply to the senate."""Book 34,Chapter 25,"As soon as the troops arrived from Elatia, Quinctius set out tolead them towards Argos. When near Cleonae he was met by the praetor,Aristaenus, with ten thousand Achaean foot and one thousand horse; andhaving joined forces, they pitched their camp at a small distance fromthence. Next day they marched down into the plains of Argos, andfixed their post about four miles from that city. The commander of theLacedaemonian garrison was Pythagoras, the tyrant's son-in-law, andhis wife's brother; who, on the approach of the Romans, posted strongguards in both the citadels, for Argos has two, and in every otherplace that was commodious for defence, or exposed to danger. But,while thus employed, he could by no means dissemble the dread inspiredby the approach of the Romans; and, to the alarm from abroad, wasadded an insurrection within. There was an Argive, named Damocles,a youth of more spirit than prudence, who held conversations, withproper persons, on a design of expelling the garrison; at first, withthe precaution of imposing an oath, but afterwards, through hiseager desire to add strength to the conspiracy, he estimated people'ssincerity with too little caution. While he was in conference withhis accomplices, an officer, sent by the commander of the garrison,summoned him to appear before him, and he perceived that his designwas betrayed; on which, exhorting the conspirators, who were present,to take arms with him, rather than be tortured to death, he went onwith a few companions towards the forum, crying out to all who wishedthe preservation of the state, to follow him as the vindicator andauthor of their liberty. He could prevail on none to join him; forthey saw no prospect of any attainable advantage, and much less anysufficiently powerful support. While he exclaimed in this manner, theLacedaemonians surrounded him and his party, and put them to death.Many others were afterwards seized, the greater part of whom wereexecuted, and the remaining few thrown into prison. During thefollowing night, great numbers, letting themselves down from the wallsby ropes, came over to the Romans."Book 34,Chapter 26,"As these men affirmed, that if the Roman army had been at thegates, this commotion would not have ended without effect; and that,if the camp was brought nearer, the Argives would not remain inactive;Quinctius sent some horsemen and infantry, lightly accoutred, who,meeting at the Cylarabis, a place of exercise, less than three hundredpaces from the city, a party of Lacedaemonians, who sallied out of agate, engaged them, and, without much difficulty, drove them back intothe town; and the Roman general encamped on the very spot where thebattle had been fought. There he passed one day, on the look-out ifany new commotion might arise; but perceiving that the inhabitantswere quite depressed by fear, he called a council concerning thebesieging of Argos. All the deputies of Greece, except Aristaenus,were of one opinion, that, as that city was the sole object of thewar, with it the war should commence. This was by no means agreeableto Quinctius; but he listened, with evident marks of approbation,to Aristaenus, arguing in opposition to the joint opinion of allthe rest; while he himself added, that ""as the war was undertaken infavour of the Argives, against the tyrant, what could be less properthan to leave the enemy in quiet, and lay siege to Argos? For hispart, he was resolved to point his arms against the main object of thewar, Lacedaemon and the tyrant."" He then dismissed the meeting, andsent out light-armed cohorts to collect forage. Whatever was ripe inthe adjacent country, they reaped, and brought together; and whatwas green they trod down and destroyed, that the enemy might notsubsequently get it. He then proceeded over Mount Parthenius, and,passing by Tegaea, encamped on the third day at Caryae; where hewaited for the auxiliary troops of the allies, before he entered theenemy's territory. Fifteen hundred Macedonians came from Philip, andfour hundred horsemen of the Thessalians; and now the Roman generalhad no occasion to wait for more auxiliaries, having abundance; but hewas obliged to stop for supplies of provisions, which he had orderedthe neighbouring cities to furnish. He was joined also by a powerfulnaval force; Lucius Quinctius had already come from Leucas, with fortyships; eighteen ships of war had arrived from the Rhodians; and kingEumenes was cruising among the Cyclades, with ten decked ships, thirtybarks, and smaller vessels of various sorts. Of the Lacedaemoniansthemselves, also, a great many, who had been driven from home by thecruelty of the tyrants, came into the Roman camp, in hopes of beingreinstated in their country; for the number was very great of thosewho had been banished by the several despots, during many generationssince they first got Lacedaemon into their power. The principal personamong the exiles was Agesipolis, to whom the sovereignty of Lacedaemonbelonged in right of his birth; but who had been driven out when aninfant by Lycurgus, after the death of Cleomenes, who was the firsttyrant of Lacedaemon."Book 34,Chapter 27,"Although Nabis was enclosed between such powerful armaments onland and sea, and, on a comparative view of his own and his enemy'sstrength, could scarcely conceive any degree of hope; yet he did notdesist from the war, but brought, from Crete, a thousand chosen youngmen of that country in addition to a thousand whom he had before; hehad, besides, under arms, three thousand mercenary soldiers, and tenthousand of his countrymen, with the peasants, who belonged to thefortresses. He fortified the city with a ditch and rampart; and lestany intestine commotion should arise, curbed the people's spirits byfear, punishing them with extreme severity, as he could not hope forgood wishes towards a tyrant. As he had his suspicions respecting someof the citizens, he drew out all his forces to a field called Dromos,(the course,) and ordered the Lacedaemonians to be called to anassembly without their arms. He then formed a line of armed men roundthe place where they were assembled, observing briefly, ""that he oughtto be excused, if, at such a juncture, he feared and guarded againstevery thing that might happen; and that, if the present state ofaffairs subjected any to suspicion, it was their advantage to beprevented from attempting any design, rather than to be punishedfor attempting it: he therefore intended,"" he said, ""to keep certainpersons in custody, until the storm, which then threatened, shouldhave passed over; and would discharge them as soon as the enemy shouldhave been driven away, from whom the danger would be less, when properprecaution was taken against internal treachery."" He then ordered thenames of about eighty of the principal young men to be called over,and as each answered to his name, he put them in custody. On the nightfollowing, they were all put to death. Some of the Helotes, a race ofrustics, who have been feudal vassals even from the earliest times,being charged with an intention to desert, they were driven withstripes through all the streets, and put to death. The terror whichthis excited so confounded the multitude, as to deter them fromall attempts to effect a revolution. He kept his forces within thefortifications, knowing that he was not a match for the enemy in thefield; and, besides, he was afraid to leave the city, while all men'sminds were in a state of such suspense and uncertainty."Book 34,Chapter 28,"Quinctius, when all his preparations were now sufficiently made,decamped; and, on the second day, came to Sellasia, on the riverOenus, on the spot where it is said Antigonus, king of Macedonia,fought a pitched battle with Cleomenes, tyrant of Lacedaemon. Beingtold that the ascent from thence was difficult, and the passes narrow,he made a short circuit by the mountains, sending forward a party tomake a road, and came, by a tolerably broad and open passage, to theriver Eurotas, where it flows almost immediately under the walls ofthe city. Here, the tyrant's auxiliary troops attacked the Romans,while they were forming their camp, together with Quinctius himself,(who, with a division of cavalry and light troops, had advanced beyondthe rest,) and threw them into a state of alarm and confusion; notexpecting any thing of the kind, as no one had opposed them throughouttheir whole march, and they had passed, as it were, through a friendlyterritory. The disorder lasted a considerable time, the infantrycalling for aid on the cavalry, and the cavalry on the infantry, eachhaving but little confidence in himself. At length, the foremost ranksof the legions came up; and no sooner had the cohorts of the vanguardtaken part in the fight, than those who had lately been an object ofdread were driven back in terror into the city. The Romans, retiringso far from the wall as to be out of the reach of weapons, stood therefor some time in battle-array; and then, none of the enemy coming outagainst them, retired to their camp. Next day Quinctius led on hisarmy in regular order along the bank of the river, passed the city, tothe foot of the mountain of Menelaus, the legionary cohorts marchingin front, and the cavalry and light infantry bringing up the rear.Nabis kept his mercenary troops, on whom he placed his whole reliance,in readiness, and drawn up in a body, within the walls, intending toattack the rear of the enemy; and, as soon as the last of their troopspassed by, these rushed out of the town, from several places at once,with as great fury as the day before. The rear was commanded by AppiusClaudius, who having beforehand prepared his men to expect such anevent, that it might not come upon them unawares, instantly madehis troops face about, and presented an entire front to the enemy. Aregular engagement, therefore, took place, as if two complete lineshad encountered, and it lasted a considerable time; but at lengthNabis's troops betook themselves to flight, which would have beenattended with less dismay and danger, if they had not been closelypressed by the Achaeans, who were well acquainted with the ground.These made dreadful havoc, and dispersing them entirely, obligedthe greater part to throw away their arms. Quinctius encamped nearAmyclae; and afterwards, when he had utterly laid waste all thepleasant and thickly inhabited country round the city, not one of theenemy venturing out of the gates, he removed his camp to the riverEurotas. From thence he ravaged the valley lying under Taygetus, andthe country reaching as far as the sea."Book 34,Chapter 29,"About the same time, Lucius Quinctius got possession of the townson the sea-coast; of some, by their voluntary surrender; of others, byfear or force. Then, learning that the Lacedaemonians made Gythium therepository of all their naval stores, and that the Roman camp was atno great distance from the sea, he resolved to attack that townwith his whole force. It was, at that time, a place of considerablestrength; well furnished with great numbers of native inhabitants andsettlers from other parts, and with every kind of warlike stores. Veryseasonably for Quinctius, when commencing an enterprise of no easynature, king Eumenes and the Rhodian fleet came to his assistance. Thevast multitude of seamen, collected out of the three fleets, finishedin a few days all the works requisite for the siege of a city sostrongly fortified, both on the land side and on that next the sea.Covered galleries were soon brought up; the wall was undermined, and,at the same time, shaken with battering rams. By the frequent shocksgiven with these, one of the towers was thrown down, and, by its fall,the adjoining wall on each side was laid flat. The Romans, on this,attempted to force in, both on the side next the port, to which theapproach was more level than to the rest, hoping to divert the enemy'sattention from the more open passage, and, at the same time, to enterthe breach caused by the falling of the wall. They were near effectingtheir design of penetrating into the town, when the assault wassuspended by the prospect which was held out of the surrender ofthe city. This however, was subsequently dissipated. Dexagoridas andGorgopas commanded there, with equal authority. Dexagoridas had sentto the Roman general a message that he would give up the city; and,after the time and the mode of proceeding had been agreed on, hewas slain as a traitor by Gorgopas, and the defence of the city wasmaintained with redoubled vigour by this single commander. The furtherprosecution of the siege would have been much more difficult, had notTitus Quinctius arrived with a body of four thousand chosen men. Heshowed his army in order of battle, on the brow of a hill at a smalldistance from the city; and, on the other side, Lucius Quinctius pliedthe enemy hard with his engines, both on the quarter of the sea, andof the land; on which Gorgopas was compelled to adopt that proceeding,which, in the case of another, he had punished with death. Afterstipulating for liberty to carry away the soldiers whom he had thereas a garrison, he surrendered the city to Quinctius. Previous to thesurrender of Gythium, Pythagoras, who had been left as commanderat Argos, having intrusted the defence of the city to Timocrates ofPellene, with a thousand mercenary soldiers, and two thousand Argives,came to Lacedaemon and joined Nabis."Book 34,Chapter 30,"Although Nabis had been greatly alarmed at the first arrival ofthe Roman fleet, and the surrender of the towns on the sea-coast,yet, as long as Gythium was held by his troops he had quieted hisapprehensions with that scanty hope; but when he heard that Gythium,too, was given up to the Romans, and saw that he had no room for anykind of hope on the land, where every place round was in the handsof the enemy, and that he was totally excluded from the sea, heconsidered that he must yield to fortune. He first sent a messengerinto the Roman camp, to learn whether permission would be given tosend ambassadors. This being consented to, Pythagoras came to thegeneral, with no other commission than to propose a conference betweenthat commander and the tyrant. A council was summoned on the proposal,and every one present agreeing in opinion that a conference shouldbe granted, a time and place were appointed. They came, with moderateescorts, to some hills in the interjacent ground; and leaving theircohorts there, in posts open to the view of both parties, they wentdown to the place of meeting; Nabis attended by a select party of hisbody-guards; Quinctius by his brother, king Eumenes, Sosilaus, theRhodian, Aristaenus, praetor of the Achaeans, and a few militarytribunes."Book 34,Chapter 31,"Then the tyrant, having the choice given him either to speak firstor to listen, began thus: ""Titus Quinctius, and you who are present,if I could collect from my own reflections the reason of your havingeither declared or actually made war against me, I should have waitedin silence the issue of my destiny. But in the present state ofthings, I could not repress my desire of knowing, before I am ruined,the cause for which my ruin is resolved on. And in truth, if youwere such men as the Carthaginians are represented to be,--men whoconsidered the obligation of faith, pledged in alliances, as in nodegree sacred, I should not wonder if you were the less scrupulouswith respect to your conduct towards me. But, instead of that, when Ilook at you, I perceive that you are Romans: men who allow treaties tobe the most solemn of religious acts, and faith, pledged therein,the strongest of human ties. Then, when I look back at myself, I amconfident I am one who, as a member of the community, am, in commonwith the rest of the Lacedaemonians, included in a treaty subsistingwith you, of very ancient date; and likewise have, lately, during thewar with Philip, concluded anew, in my own name, a personal friendshipand alliance with you. But it appears I have violated and cancelledthat treaty, by holding possession of the city of Argos. In whatmanner shall I defend this? By the consideration of the fact, or ofthe time. The consideration of the fact furnishes me with a twofolddefence: for, in the first place, in consequence of an invitation fromthe inhabitants themselves, and of their voluntary act of surrender,I accepted the possession of that city, and did not seize it by force.In the next place, I accepted it, when the city was in league withPhilip, not in alliance with you. Then the consideration of the timeacquits me, inasmuch as when I was in actual possession of Argos, thealliance was entered into between you and me, and you stipulated thatI should send you aid against Philip, not that I should withdraw mygarrison from that city. In this dispute, therefore, so far as itrelates to Argos, I have unquestionably the advantage, both fromthe equity of the proceeding, as I gained possession of a city whichbelonged not to you, but to your enemy; and as I gained it by its ownvoluntary act, and not by forcible compulsion; and also from your ownacknowledgment; since, in the articles of our alliance, you leftArgos to me. But then, the name of tyrant, and my conduct, are strongobjections against me: that I call forth slaves to a state of freedom;that I carry out the indigent part of the populace, and give themsettlements in lands. With respect to the title by which I am styled,I can answer thus: That, let me be what I may, I am the same now thatI was at the time when you yourself, Titus Quinctius, concluded analliance with me. I remember, that I was then styled king by you;now, I see, I am called tyrant. If, therefore, I had since alteredthe style of my office, I might have an account to render of myfickleness: as you choose to alter it, that account should be renderedby you. As to what relates to the augmenting the number of thepopulace, by giving liberty to slaves, and the distribution of landsto the needy; on this head, too, I might defend myself by a referenceto time: These measures, of what complexion soever they are, I hadpractised before you formed friendship with me, and received my aidin the war against Philip. But, if I did these same things, at thismoment, I would not say to you, how did I thereby injure you, orviolate the friendship subsisting between us? but that, in so doing,I acted agreeably to the practice and institutions of my ancestors.Do not estimate what is done at Lacedaemon by the standard of your ownlaws and constitution. There is no necessity for comparing particularinstitutions: you are guided in your choice of a horseman, by thequantity of his property; in your choice of a foot soldier, by thequantity of his property; and your plan is, that a few should aboundin wealth, and that the body of the people should be in subjectionto them. Our lawgiver did not choose that the administration ofgovernment should be in the hands of a few, such as you call a senate;or that this or that order of citizens should have a superiorityover the rest: but he considered that, by equalizing the property anddignity of all, he should multiply the number of those who were tobear arms for their country. I acknowledge that I have enlarged onthese matters, beyond what consists with the conciseness customarywith my countrymen, and that the sum of the whole might be comprisedin few words: that, since I first commenced a friendship with you, Ihave given you no just cause to repent it."""Book 34,Chapter 32,"The Roman general answered: ""We never contracted any friendshipor alliance with you, but with Pelops, the right and lawful king ofLacedaemon: whose authority, while the Carthaginian, Gallic, andother wars, succeeding one another, kept us constantly employed,the tyrants, who after him held Lacedaemon under forced subjection,usurped into their own hands, as did you also during the late warwith Macedonia. For what could be less fitting, than that we, who werewaging war against Philip, in favour of the liberty of Greece, shouldcontract friendship with a tyrant, and a tyrant the most cruel andviolent towards his subjects that ever existed? But, even supposingthat you had not either seized or held Argos by iniquitous means, itwould be incumbent on us, when we are giving liberty to all Greece, toreinstate Lacedaemon also in its ancient freedom, and the enjoyment ofits own laws, which you just now spoke of, as if you were a rivalof Lycurgus. Shall we take pains to make Philip's garrisons evacuateTassus and Bargylii; and shall we leave Lacedaemon and Argos, thosetwo most illustrious cities, formerly the lights of Greece, underyour feet, that their continuance in bondage may tarnish our title ofdeliverers of Greece? But the Argives took part with Philip: we excuseyou from taking any concern in that cause, so that you need not beangry with them on our behalf. We have received sufficient proof, thatthe guilt of that proceeding is chargeable on two only, or, at most,three persons, and not on the state; just, indeed, as in the case ofthe invitation given to you and to your army, and your reception intothe citadel, not one step was taken by public authority. We know,that the Thessalians, Phocians, and Locrians, with unanimous consent,joined in espousing the cause of Philip; yet we have given liberty tothem in common with the rest of Greece. How then can you suppose weshall conduct ourselves towards the Argives, who are acquitted ofhaving publicly authorized misconduct? You said, that your invitingslaves to liberty, and the distribution of lands among the indigent,were objected to you as crimes; and crimes, surely, they are, of nosmall magnitude. But what are they in comparison with those atrociousdeeds, that are daily perpetrated by you and your adherents, incontinual succession? Show us a free assembly of the people, either atArgos or Lacedaemon, if you wish to hear a true recital of the crimesof the most abandoned tyranny. To omit all other instances of olderdate, what a massacre did your son-in-law, Pythagoras, make at Argosalmost before my eyes! What another did you yourself perpetrate, whenI was nearly within the confines of the Lacedaemonians! Now, giveorders, that the persons whom you took out of the midst of anassembly, and committed to prison, after declaring, in the hearing ofall your countrymen, that you would keep them in custody, be producedin their chains, that their wretched parents may know that those arealive, for whom, under a false impression, they are mourning. Well,but you say, though all these things were so, Romans, how do theyconcern you? Can you say this to the deliverers of Greece; to peoplewho crossed the sea, and have maintained a war on sea and land, toeffect its deliverance? Still you tell us, you have not directlyviolated the alliance, or the friendship established between us. Howmany instances must I produce of your having done so? But I will notgo into long detail; I will bring the matter to a short issue. Bywhat acts is friendship violated? Most effectually by these two:by treating our friends as foes; and by uniting yourself with ourenemies. Each of these has been done by you. For Messene, which hadbeen united to us in friendship, by one and the same bond of alliancewith Lacedaemon, you, while professing yourself our ally, reduced tosubjection by force of arms, though you knew it was in alliance withus; and you contracted with Philip, our professed enemy, not onlyan alliance, but even an affinity, through the intervention of hisgeneral, Philocles: and waging actual war against us, with yourpiratical ships, you made the sea round Malea unsafe, and you capturedand slew more Roman citizens almost than Philip himself; and to ourships conveying provisions to our armies the coast of Macedonia itselfwas less dangerous, than the promontory of Malea. Cease, therefore, tovaunt your good faith, and the obligations of treaties; and, droppinga popular style of discourse, speak as a tyrant, and as an enemy."""Book 34,Chapter 33,"Aristaenus then began, at first to advise, and afterwards evento beseech Nabis, while it was yet in his power, and he had theopportunity, to consider what was best for himself and his interests.He then mentioned the names of several tyrants in the neighbouringstates who had resigned their authority, and restored liberty to theirpeople, and afterwards spent among their fellow citizens not onlya secure but an honoured old age. These observations having beenreciprocally made and listened to, the approach of night broke up theconference. Next day Nabis said, that he was willing to cede Argos,and withdraw his garrison, since such was the desire of the Romans,and to deliver up the prisoners and deserters; and if they demandedany thing further, he requested that they would set it down inwriting, that he might deliberate on it with his friends. Thus thetyrant gained time for consultation; and Quinctius also, on his part,called a council, to which he summoned the chiefs of the allies. Thegreatest part were of opinion, that ""they ought to persevere in thewar, and that the tyrant should be altogether got rid of; otherwisethe liberty of Greece would never be secure. That it would have beenmuch better never to have entered on the war than to drop it after itwas begun; for this would be a kind of approbation of his tyrannicalusurpation, and which would establish him more firmly, as giving thecountenance of the Roman people to his ill-acquired authority, andthat he would quickly spirit up many in other states to plot againstthe liberty of their countrymen."" The wishes of the general himselftended rather to peace; for he saw that, as the enemy was shut up inthe town, nothing remained but a siege, and that must be very tedious.For it was not Gythium that they must besiege, though even that placehad been gained by capitulation, not by assault; but Lacedaemon, acity most powerful in men and arms. The only hope which theycould have formed was, that, on the first approach of their army,dissensions and insurrections might have been raised within: but,though the standards had been seen to advance almost to the gates,not one person had stirred. To this he added, that ""Villius theambassador, returning from Antiochus, brought intelligence, that thepeace was an unsound one; and that the king had come over into Europewith a much more powerful armament by sea and land than before. Now,if the army should be engaged in the siege of Lacedaemon, with whatother forces could the war be maintained against a king of his greatpower and strength?"" These arguments he urged openly; but beneath allthis there lay a concealed anxiety lest one of the new consulsshould be appointed to the province of Greece; and then the honour ofterminating the war, in which he had proceeded so far, must be yieldedto a successor."Book 34,Chapter 34,"Finding that he could not, by opposition, make any alterationin the sentiments of the allies, by pretending to go over to theiropinion, he led them all into a concurrence in his plan. ""Be it so,""said he, ""and may success attend us: let us lay siege to Lacedaemon,since that is your choice. However, as a business so slow in itsprogress, as you know the besieging of cities to be, very often wearsout the patience of the besiegers sooner than that of the besieged,you ought at once to make up your minds to this, that we must pass thewinter under the walls of Lacedaemon. If this delay involved only toiland danger, I would recommend to you to prepare your minds and bodiesto support these. But, in the present case, vast expenses also willbe requisite for the construction of works, for machines and engines,sufficient for the siege of so great a city, and for procuring storesof provisions for the winter to serve you and us: therefore, toprevent your being suddenly disconcerted, or shamefully deserting anenterprise which you had engaged in, I think it will be necessary foryou to write home to your respective states, and learn what degree ofspirit and of strength each possesses. Of auxiliary troops I have asufficient number, and to spare; but the more numerous we are, themore numerous will be our wants. The country of the enemy has nothingleft but the naked soil. Besides, the winter is at hand, which willrender it difficult to convey what we may stand in need of fromdistant places."" This speech first turned their thoughts to thedomestic evils prevailing in their several states; the indolence ofthose who remained at home; the envy and misrepresentations to whichthose who were serving abroad were liable; that a state of freedomwas a difficult one in which to procure unanimity; the want of publicfunds, and people's backwardness to contribute out of their privateproperty. Their inclinations being thus suddenly changed, they gavefull power to the general, to do whatever he judged conducive to thegeneral interest of the Roman people and their allies."Book 34,Chapter 35,"Then Quinctius, consulting only his lieutenant-generals andmilitary tribunes, drew up the following conditions on which peaceshould be made with the tyrant: ""That there should be a suspension ofarms for six months, between Nabis on one part, and the Romans, kingEumenes, and the Rhodians on the other. That Titus Quinctius and Nabisshould immediately send ambassadors to Rome, in order that the peacemight be ratified by authority of the senate. That, whatever day awritten copy of these conditions should be delivered to Nabis, on thatday should the armistice commence; and, within ten days after, hisgarrisons should be withdrawn from Argos, and all other towns inthe territory of the Argives; all which towns should be entirelyevacuated, restored to freedom, and delivered to the Romans. That noslave, whether belonging to the king, the public, or a private person,be removed out of any of them; and if any had been removed before,that they be faithfully restored to their owners. That he shouldreturn the ships, which he had taken from the maritime states; andshould not have any other than two barks; and these to be navigatedwith no more than sixteen oars. That he should restore to all thestates in alliance with the Roman people, the prisoners and desertersin his hands; and to the Messenians, all the effects that could bediscovered, and which their possessors could own. That he should,likewise, restore to the exiled Lacedaemonians their children, andtheir wives, who chose to follow their husbands; provided that nowoman should be obliged, against her will, to go with her husband intoexile. That such of the mercenary soldiers of Nabis as had desertedhim, and gone either to their own countries or to the Romans, shouldhave all their effects faithfully returned to them. That he shouldhold possession of no city in the island of Crete; and that such aswere then in his possession should be given up to the Romans. Thathe should not form any alliance, or wage war, with any of the Cretanstates, or with any other. That he should withdraw all his garrisonsfrom those cities, which he should give up, and which had putthemselves, and their country, under the dominion and protection ofthe Roman people; and should take care that, in future, he shouldrestrain both himself and his subjects from molesting them. That heshould not build any town or fort in his own, or any other territory.That, to secure the performance of these conditions, he should givefive hostages, such as the Roman general should choose, and amongthem his own son: and should pay, at present, one hundred talents ofsilver; and fifty talents, annually, for eight years."""Book 34,Chapter 36,"These articles were put into writing, and sent into Lacedaemon,the camp having been removed, and brought nearer to the town. Thetyrant saw nothing in them that gave him much satisfaction, exceptingthat, beyond his hopes, no mention had been made of bringing back theexiles. But what mortified him most of all, was, the depriving him ofhis shipping, and of the maritime towns: for the sea had been a sourceof great profit to him; his piratical vessels having continuallyinfested the whole coast from the promontory of Malea. Besides, hefound in the young men of those towns recruits for his army, who madeby far the best of his soldiers. Though he discussed those conditionsin private with his confidential friends, yet, as the ministers in thecourts of kings, faithless in other respects, are particularly sowith respect to the concealing of secrets, rumour soon made themall public. The public, in general, expressed not so great adisapprobation of the whole of the terms, as did individuals, of thearticles particularly affecting themselves. Those who had the wivesof the exiles in marriage, or had possessed themselves of any of theirproperty, were provoked, as if they were to lose what was their own,and not to make restitution of what belonged to others. The slaves,who had been set at liberty by the tyrant, perceived plainly, not onlythat their enfranchisement would be annulled, but that their servitudewould be much more severe than it had been before, when they shouldbe again put under the power of their incensed masters. The mercenarysoldiers were dissatisfied, because, in consequence of a peace, theirpay would cease; and they knew also, that they could not return amongtheir own countrymen, who detested not tyrants more than they didtheir abettors."Book 34,Chapter 37,"They at first spoke of these matters, in their circles, withmurmurs of discontent; and afterwards, suddenly ran to arms. Fromwhich tumultuous proceeding, the tyrant perceived that the passionsof the multitude were of themselves sufficiently inflamed, andimmediately ordered a general assembly to be summoned. Here heexplained to them the terms which the Romans strove to impose, towhich he falsely added others, more severe and humiliating. While,on the mention of each particular, sometimes the whole assembly,sometimes different parties, raised a shout of disapprobation, heasked them, ""What answer they wished him to give; or what they wouldhave him do?"" On which all, as it were with one voice, cried out, ""Togive no answer, to continue the war;"" and they began, as is commonwith a multitude, every one to encourage the rest, to keep up theirspirits, and cherish good hopes, observing, that ""fortune favours thebrave."" Animated by these expressions, the tyrant assured them, thatAntiochus, and the Aetolians, would come to their assistance; andthat he had, in the mean time, resources abundantly sufficient for themaintenance of a siege. The very mention of peace had vanished fromthe minds of all, and unable to contain themselves longer in quiet,they ran out in parties against the advanced guards of the enemy.The sally of these few skirmishers, and the weapons which they threw,immediately removed all doubt from the Romans that the war was tocontinue. During the four following days, several slight encounterstook place, at first without any decisive result; but, on the fifthday after, in a kind of regular engagement, the Lacedaemonianswere beaten back into the town, in such a panic, that several Romansoldiers, pressing close on the rear of the fugitives, entered thecity through open spaces, not secured with a wall, of which, at thattime, there were several."Book 34,Chapter 38,"Then Quinctius, having, by this repulse, effectually checked thesallies of the enemy, and being fully convinced that he had now noalternative, but must besiege the city, sent persons to bring up allthe marine forces from Gythium; and, in the mean time, rode himself,with some military tribunes, round the walls, to take a view of thesituation of the place. In former times, Sparta had no wall; of late,the tyrants had built walls in the places where the ground Was openand level; but the higher places, and those more difficult of access,they secured by placing guards of soldiers instead of fortifications.When he had sufficiently examined every circumstance, having resolvedon making a general assault, he surrounded the city with all hisforces, the number of which, Romans and allies, horse and foot, navaland land forces, all together, amounted to fifty thousand men.Some brought scaling-ladders, some fire-brands, some other matters,wherewith they might not only assail the enemy, but strike terror. Theorders were, that on raising the shout, all should advance at once, inorder that the Lacedaemonians, being alarmed at the same time in everyquarter, might be at a loss where, first, to make head, or whither tobring aid. The main force of his army he formed in three divisions,and ordered one to attack on the side of the Phoebeum, another on thatof the Dictynneum, and the third near a place called Heptagoniae, allwhich are open places without walls. Though surrounded on all sides bysuch a violent alarm, the tyrant, at first, attentive to every suddenshout and hasty message, either ran up himself, or sent others,wherever the greatest danger pressed; but, afterwards, he was sostunned by the horror and confusion that prevailed all around, as tobecome incapable either of giving proper directions, or of hearingwhat was said, and to lose, not only his judgment, but almost hisreason."Book 34,Chapter 39,"For some time the Lacedaemonians maintained their ground againstthe Romans, in the narrow passes; and three armies, on each side,fought, at one time, in different places. Afterwards, when the heat ofthe contest increased, the contest was, by no means, an equal one: forthe Lacedaemonians fought with missile arms, against which the Romansoldiers, by means of their large shields, easily defended themselves,and many of their blows either missed, or were very weak; for, thenarrowness of the place causing them to be closely crowded together,they neither had room to discharge their weapons with a previous run,which gives great force to them, nor clear and steady footing whilethey made their throw Of those, therefore, discharged against thefront of the Romans, none pierced their bodies, few even theirshields; but several were wounded by those who surrounded them fromhigher places. And presently, when they advanced a little, they werehurt unawares, both with javelins, and tiles also thrown from the topsof the houses. On this they raised their shields over their heads;and joining them so close together as to leave no room for injury fromsuch random casts, or even for the insertion of a javelin, by a handwithin reach, they pressed forward under cover of this tortoise fence.For some time the narrow streets, being thronged with a multitude oftheir own soldiers, and also of the enemy, considerably retarded theprogress of the Romans; but when once, by gradually pushing back theenemy, they gained the wider streets of the city, the impetuosity oftheir attack could no longer be withstood. While the Lacedaemonians,having turned their backs, fled precipitately to the higher places,Nabis, being utterly confounded, as if the town were already taken,began to look about for a way to make his escape. Pythagoras, while inother respects he displayed the spirit and conduct of a general, wasnow the sole means of saving the city from being taken. For he orderedthe buildings nearest to the wall to be set on fire; and these beinginstantly in a blaze, those who, on another occasion, would havebrought help to extinguish the fire, now helping to increase it, theroofs tumbled on the Romans; and not only fragments of the tiles, butalso the half-burned timber, reached the soldiers: the flames spreadwide, and the smoke caused a degree of terror even greater than thedanger. In consequence, the Romans who were without the city, andwere just then making the principal attack, retired from the wall;and those who were within, fearing lest the fire, rising behind them,should put it out of their power to rejoin the rest of the army, beganto retreat. Whereupon Quinctius, seeing how matters stood, ordered ageneral retreat to be sounded.--Thus, being at length recalled from acity which they had nearly taken, they returned to their camp."Book 34,Chapter 40,"Quinctius, conceiving greater hopes from the fears of the enemythan from the immediate effect of his operations, kept them in acontinual alarm during the three succeeding days; sometimes harassingthem with assaults, sometimes enclosing several places with works,so as to leave no passage open for flight. These menaces had such aneffect on the tyrant that he again sent Pythagoras to solicit peace.Quinctius, at first, rejected him with disdain, ordering him to quitthe camp; but afterwards, on his suppliant entreaties, and throwinghimself at his feet, he admitted him to an audience. The purport ofhis discourse, at first, was, an offer of implicit submission to thewill of the Romans; but this availed nothing, being considered asnugatory and indecisive. The business was, at length, brought to thisissue, that a truce should be made on the conditions delivered inwriting a few days before, and the money and hostages were accordinglyreceived. While the tyrant was kept shut up by the siege, the Argives,receiving frequent accounts, one after another, that Lacedaemon was onthe point of being taken, and having themselves resumed courage onthe departure of Pythagoras, with the strongest part of his garrison,looked now with contempt on the small number remaining in the citadel;and, being headed by a person named Archippus, drove the garrisonout. They gave Timocrates, of Pellene, leave to retire, with solemnassurance of sparing his life, in consideration of the mildnesswhich he had shown in his government. In the midst of this rejoicing,Quinctius arrived, after having granted peace to the tyrant, dismissedEumenes and the Rhodians from Lacedaemon, and sent back his brother,Lucius Quinctius, to the fleet."Book 34,Chapter 41,"The Nemaean games, the most celebrated of all the festivals, andtheir most splendid public spectacle, had been omitted, at the regulartime, on account of the disasters of the war: the state now, in thefulness of their joy, ordered them to be celebrated on the arrival ofthe Roman general and his army; and appointed the general, himself,president of the games. There were many circumstances which heightenedtheir happiness: their countrymen, whom Pythagoras, lately, and,before that, Nabis, had carried away, were brought home fromLacedaemon; those who on the discovery of the conspiracy byPythagoras, and when the massacre was already begun, had fled fromhome, now returned; they saw their liberty restored, after a longinterval, and beheld, in their city, the Romans, the authors of itsrestoration, whose only view, in making war on the tyrant, was thesupport of their interest. The freedom of the Argives was, also,solemnly announced, by the voice of a herald, on the very day of theNemaean games. Whatever pleasure the Achaeans felt on Argos beingreinstated in the general council of Achaia, it was, in a greatmeasure, alloyed by Lacedaemon being left in slavery, and the tyrantclose at their side. As to the Aetolians, they loudly railed at thatmeasure in every meeting. They remarked, that ""the war with Philip wasnot ended until he evacuated all the cities of Greece. But Lacedaemonwas left to the tyrant, while the lawful king, who had been, at thetime, in the Roman camp, and others, the noblest of the citizens, mustlive in exile: so that the Roman nation was become a partisan of Nabisin his tyranny."" Quinctius led back his army to Elatia, whence he hadset out to the Spartan war. Some writers say, that the tyrant's methodof carrying on hostilities was not by sallies from the city, but thathe encamped in the face of the Romans; and that, after he had declinedfighting a long time, waiting for succours from the Aetolians, he wasforced to come to an engagement, by an attack which the Romans made onhis foragers, when, being defeated in that battle, and beaten out ofhis camp, he sued for peace, after fifteen thousand of his men hadbeen killed, and more than four thousand made prisoners."Book 34,Chapter 42,"Nearly at the same time, arrived at Rome a letter from TitusQuinctius, with an account of his proceedings at Lacedaemon; andanother, out of Spain, from Marcus Porcius, the consul; whereupon thesenate decreed a supplication, for three days, in the name of each.The other consul, Lucius Valerius, as his province had remained quietsince the defeat of the Boians at the wood of Litana, came home toRome to hold the elections. Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, asecond time, and Tiberius Sempronius Longus, were elected consuls. Thefathers of these two had been consuls in the first year of the secondPunic war. The election of praetors was then held, and the choicefell on Publius Cornelius Scipio, two Cneius Corneliuses, Merendaand Blasio, Cneius Domitius Aenobarbus, Sextus Digitius, and TitusJuvencius Thalna. As soon as the elections were finished, the consulreturned to his province. The inhabitants of Ferentinum, this year,laid claim to a privilege unheard of before; that Latins, giving intheir names for a Roman colony, should be deemed citizens of Rome.Some colonists, who had given in their names for Puteoli, Salernum,and Buxentum, assumed, on that ground, the character of Romancitizens; but the senate determined that they were not."Book 34,Chapter 43,"In the beginning of the year, wherein Publius Scipio Africanus,a second time, and Tiberius Sempronius Longus were consuls, twoambassadors from the tyrant Nabis came to Rome. The senate gave themaudience in the temple of Apollo, outside the city. They entreatedthat a peace might be concluded on the terms settled with Quinctius,and obtained their request. When the question was put concerning theprovinces, the majority of the senate were of opinion, that as thewars in Spain and Macedonia were at an end, Italy should be theprovince of both the consuls; but Scipio contended that one consul wassufficient for Italy, and that Macedonia ought to be decreed to theother; that ""there was every reason to apprehend a dangerous war withAntiochus, for he had already, of his own accord, come into Europe;and how did they suppose he would act in future, when he should beencouraged to a war, on one hand, by the Aetolians, avowed enemiesof their state, and stimulated, on the other, by Hannibal, a generalfamous for his victories over the Romans?"" While the consularprovinces were in dispute, the praetors cast lots for theirs. The cityjurisdiction fell to Cneius Domitius; the foreign, to Titus Juvencius:Farther Spain, to Publius Cornelius; Hither Spain, to Sextus Digitius;Sicily, to Cneius Cornelius Blasio; Sardinia, to Cneius CorneliusMerenda. It was resolved, that no new army should be sent intoMacedonia, but that the one which was there should be brought home toItaly by Quinctius, and disbanded; that the army which was in Spain,under Marcus Porcius Cato, should likewise be disbanded; that Italyshould be the province of both the consuls, and that they shouldraise two city legions; so that, after the disbanding of the armies,mentioned in the resolution of the senate, there should be in alleight Roman legions."Book 34,Chapter 44,"A sacred spring had been celebrated, in the preceding year, duringthe consulate of Marcus Porcius and Lucius Valerius; but PubliusLicinius, one of the pontiffs, having made a report, first, tothe college of pontiffs, and afterwards, under the sanction of thecollege, to the senate, that it had not been duly performed, theyresolved, that it should be celebrated anew, under the direction ofthe pontiffs; and that the great games, vowed together with it, shouldbe exhibited at the same expense which was customary; that the sacredspring should be deemed to comprehend all the cattle born between thecalends of March and the day preceding the calends of May, in the yearof the consulate of Publius Cornelius Scipio and Tiberius SemproniusLongus. Then followed the election of censors. Sextus Aelius Paetus,and Caius Cornelius Cethegus, being created censors, named as princeof the senate the consul Publius Scipio, whom the former censorslikewise had appointed. They passed by only three senators in thewhole, none of whom had enjoyed the honour of a curule office. Theyobtained, on another account, the highest degree of credit with thatbody; for, at the celebration of the Roman games, they ordered thecurule aediles to set apart places for the senators, distinct fromthose of the people, whereas, hitherto, all the spectators used to sitpromiscuously. Of the knights, also, very few were deprived of theirhorses; nor was severity shown towards any rank of men. The galleryof the temple of Liberty, and the Villa Publica, were repaired andenlarged by the same censors. The sacred spring, and the votive games,were celebrated, pursuant to the vow of Servius Sulpicius Galba, whenconsul. While every one's thoughts were engaged by the shows thenexhibited, Quintus Pleminius, who, for the many crimes against godsand men committed by him at Locri, had been thrown into prison,procured men who were to set fire by night to several parts ofthe city at once, in order that, while the town was thrown intoconsternation by this nocturnal disturbance, the prison might bebroken open. But this plot was disclosed by some of the accomplices,and the affair was laid before the senate. Pleminius was thrown into alower dungeon, and there put to death."Book 34,Chapter 45,"In this year colonies of Roman citizens were settled at Puteoli,Vulturnum, and Liternum; three hundred men in each place. Colonies ofRoman citizens were likewise established at Salernum and Buxentum.The lands allotted to them had formerly belonged to the Campanians.Tiberius Sempronius Longus, who was then consul, Marcus Servilius, andQuintus Minucius Thermus, were the triumviri who settled the colony.Other commissioners also, Decius Junius Brutus, Marcus BaebiusTamphilus, and Marcus Helvius, led a colony of Roman citizens toSipontum, into a district which had belonged to the Arpinians. ToTempsa, likewise, and to Croto, colonies of Roman citizens were ledout. The lands of Tempsa had been taken from the Bruttians, who hadformerly expelled the Greeks from them. Croto was possessed by Greeks.In ordering these establishments, there were named, for Croto,--CneiusOctavius, Lucius Aemilius Paullus, and Caius Pletorius; forTempsa,--Lucius Cornelius Merula, and Caius Salonius. Severalprodigies were observed at Rome that year, and others reported, fromother places. In the forum, comitium, and Capitol, drops of blood wereseen, and several showers of earth fell, and the head of Vulcan wassurrounded with a blaze of fire. It was reported that a stream of milkran in the river at Interamna; that, in some reputable families atAriminum, children were born without eyes and nose; and one, in theterritory of Picenum, that had neither hands nor feet. These prodigieswere expiated according to an order of the pontiffs; and thenine days' festival was celebrated, because the Hadrians had sentintelligence that a shower of stones had fallen in their fields."Book 34,Chapter 46,"In Gaul, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, proconsul, in a pitched battlenear Mediolanum, completely overthrew the Insubrian Gauls, and theBoians; who, under the command of Dorulacus, had crossed the Po, torouse the Insubrians to arms. Ten thousand of the enemy were slain.About this time his colleague, Marcus Porcius Cato, triumphed overSpain. He carried in the procession twenty-five thousand pounds'weight of unwrought silver, one hundred and three thousand silverdenarii,[1] five hundred and forty of Oscan silver,[2] and onethousand four hundred pounds' weight of gold. Out of the booty,he distributed to each of his soldiers two hundred and seventy_asses_;[3] and three times that amount to each horseman. TiberiusSempronius, consul, proceeding to his province, led his legions,first, into the territory of the Boians. At this time Boiorix theirchieftain, with his two brothers, after having drawn out the wholenation into the field to renew the war, pitched his camp in the opencountry, that it might be evident that he was prepared to fight incase the enemy should pass the frontiers. When the consul understoodwhat a numerous force and what a degree of resolution the enemy had,he sent an express to his colleague, requesting him, ""if he thoughtproper, to hasten to join him;"" adding, that ""he would act on thedefensive, and defer engaging in battle, until his arrival."" The samereason which made the consul wish to decline an action, inducedthe Gauls, whose spirits were raised by the backwardness of theirantagonists, to bring it on as soon as possible, that they mightfinish the affair before the two consuls should unite their forces.However, during two days, they did nothing more than stand inreadiness for battle, if any should come out against them. On thethird, they advanced furiously to the rampart, and assaulted the campon every side at once. The consul immediately ordered his men to takearms, and kept them quiet, under arms, for some time; both to add tothe foolish confidence of the enemy, and to arrange his troops at thegates, through which each party was to sally out. The two legions wereordered to march by the two principal gates; but, in the very pass ofthe gates, the Gauls opposed them in such close bodies as to stop upthe way. The fight was maintained a long time in these narrow passes;nor were their hands or swords much employed in the business, butpushing with their shields and bodies, they pressed against eachother, the Romans struggling to force their standards beyond thegates, the Gauls, to break into the camp, or, at least, to hinder theRomans from issuing forth. However, neither party could make the leastimpression on the other, until Quintus Victorius, a first centurion,and Caius Atinius, a military tribune, the former of the second,the latter of the fourth legion, had taken a course often tried indesperate conflicts; snatching the standards from the officers whocarried them, and throwing them among the enemy. In the struggle torecover the standards, the men of the second legion first made theirway out of the gate."Book 34,Chapter 47,"These were now fighting on the outside of the rampart, the fourthlegion still entangled in the gate, when a new alarm arose on theopposite side of the camp. The Gauls had broke in by the Quaestoriangate, and had slain the quaestor, Lucius Postumius, surnamed Tympanus,with Marcus Atinius and Publius Sempronius, praefects of the allies,who made an obstinate resistance; and also, near two hundred soldiers.The camp in that part had been taken, when a cohort of those who arecalled Extraordinaries, having been sent by the consul to defend theQuaestorian gate, killed some who had got within the rampart, droveout the rest, and opposed others who were attempting to breakin. About the same time, the fourth legion, and two cohorts ofExtraordinaries, burst out of the gate; and thus there were threebattles, in different places, round the camp; while the various kindsof shouts raised by them, called off the attention of the combatantsfrom their own immediate conflict to the uncertain casualties whichthreatened their friends. The battle was maintained until mid-day withequal strength, and with nearly equal hopes. At length, the fatigueand heat so far got the better of the soft relaxed bodies of theGauls, who are incapable of enduring thirst, as to make most of themgive up the fight; and the few who stood their ground, were attackedby the Romans, routed, and driven to their camp. The consul then gavethe signal for retreat, on which the greater part retired; but some,eager to continue the fight, and hoping to get possession of the camp,pressed forward to the rampart, on which the Gauls, despising theirsmall number, rushed out in a body. The Romans were then routed inturn, and compelled, by their own fear and dismay, to retreat to theircamp, which they had refused to do at the command of their general.Thus now flight and now victory alternated on both sides. The Gauls,however, had eleven thousand killed, the Romans but five thousand. TheGauls retreated into the heart of their country, and the consul ledhis legions to Placentia. Some writers say, that Scipio, after joininghis forces to those of his colleague, overran and plundered thecountry of the Boians and Ligurians, as far as the woods and marshessuffered him to proceed; others, that, without having effected anything material, he returned to Rome to hold the elections."Book 34,Chapter 48,"Titus Quinctius passed the entire winter season of this year atElatia, where he had established the winter quarters of his army, inadjusting political arrangements, and reversing the measures which hadbeen introduced in the several states under the arbitrary dominationof Philip and his deputies, who crushed the rights and liberties ofothers, in order to augment the power of those who formed a factionin their favour. Early in the spring he came to Corinth, where he hadsummoned a general convention. Ambassadors having attended from everyone of the states, so as to form a numerous assembly, he addressedthem in a long speech, in which, beginning from the first commencementof friendship between the Romans and the nation of the Greeks, heenumerated the proceedings of the commanders who had been in Macedoniabefore him, and likewise his own. His whole narration was heard withthe warmest approbation, except when he came to make mention ofNabis; and then they expressed their opinion, that it was utterlyinconsistent with the character of the deliverer of Greece to haveleft seated, in the centre of one of its most respectable states,a tyrant, who was not only insupportable to his own country, but aterror to all the states in his neighbourhood. Whereupon Quinctius,not unacquainted with this tendency of their feelings, freelyacknowledged, that ""if the business could have been accomplishedwithout the entire destruction of Lacedaemon, no mention of peace withthe tyrant ought ever to have been listened to; but that, when it wasnot possible to crush him otherwise than by the utter ruin of thismost important city, it was judged more eligible to leave the tyrantin a state of debility, stripped of almost every kind of power to doinjury to any, than to suffer the city, which must have perished inthe very process of its delivery being effectuated, to sink underremedies too violent for it to support."""Book 34,Chapter 49,"To the recital of matters past, he subjoined, that ""his intentionwas to depart shortly for Italy, and to carry with him all his troops;that they should hear, within ten days, of the garrisons havingevacuated Demetrias; and that Chalcis, the citadel of Corinth, shouldbe before their own eyes evacuated to the Achaeans: that all the worldmight know whose habit it was to deceive, that of the Romans or theAetolians, who had spread insinuations, that the cause of liberty hadbeen unwisely intrusted to the Romans, and that they had only receivedas their masters the Romans in exchange for the Macedonians. But theywere men who never scrupled what they either said or did. The rest ofthe nations he advised to form their estimate of friends from deeds,not from words; and to satisfy themselves whom they ought to trust,and against whom they ought to be on their guard; to use their libertywith moderation: for, when regulated by prudence, it was productiveof happiness both to individuals and to states; but, when pushed toexcess, it became not only obnoxious to others, but to the possessorsof it themselves an unbridled and headstrong impulse. He recommended,that those at the head of affairs, and all the several ranks of menin each particular state, should cultivate harmony between themselves;and that all should direct their views to the general interest of thewhole. For, while they acted in concert, no king or tyrant would besufficiently powerful against them: but discord and dissension gaveevery advantage to those who might plot against them; as theparty worsted in a domestic dispute generally join themselves withforeigners, rather than submit to a countryman of their own. He thenexhorted them, as the arms of others had procured their liberty, andthe good faith of foreigners had restored it to them, to apply nowtheir own diligent care to the watching and guarding of it; thatthe Roman people might perceive that those on whom they had bestowedliberty were deserving of it, and that their kindness had not been illplaced."""Book 34,Chapter 50,"On hearing these admonitions, such as parental tenderness mightdictate, every one present shed tears of joy; and they affected hisfeelings to such a degree as to interrupt his discourse. For sometime a confused noise prevailed, from those who were expressing theirapprobation of his words, and charging each other to treasure up thoseexpressions in their minds and hearts, as if they had been uttered byan oracle. Then silence ensuing, he requested of them to make diligentsearch for such Roman citizens as were in servitude among them, and tosend them into Thessaly to him, within two months; observing, that""it would not be honourable to themselves, that, in a land restoredto liberty, its deliverers should remain in servitude."" To this allexclaimed with acclamations that they returned him thanks on thisaccount in addition to others, that they had been reminded of thedischarge of a duty so indispensably incumbent on their gratitude.There was a vast number of these who had been made prisoners in thePunic war, and sold by Hannibal when their countrymen refused toransom them. That they were very numerous, is proved by what Polybiussays, that this business cost the Achaeans one hundred talents,[1]though they had fixed the price to be paid for each captive, to theowner, so low as five hundred denarii.[2] For, at that rate, therewere one thousand two hundred in Achaia. Calculate now, in proportionto this, how many were probably in all Greece."Book 34,Chapter 51,"Before the convention broke up, they saw the garrison march downfrom the citadel of Corinth, proceed forward to the gate, and depart.The general followed them, accompanied by the whole assembly, who,with loud acclamations, blessed him as their preserver and deliverer.At length, taking leave of these, and dismissing them, he returned toElatia by the same road through which he came. He thence sent AppiusClaudius, lieutenant-general, with all the troops, ordering him tomarch through Thessaly and Epirus, and to wait for him at Oricum,whence he intended to embark the army for Italy. He also wrote to hisbrother, Lucius Quinctius, lieutenant-general, and commander of thefleet, to collect thither transport ships from all the coasts ofGreece. He himself proceeded to Chalcis; and, after sending awaythe garrisons, not only from that city, but likewise from Oreum andEretria, he held there a congress of the Euboean states, whom hereminded of the condition in which he had found their affairs, and ofthat in which he was leaving them; and then dismissed the assembly. Hethen proceeded to Demetrias, and removed the garrison. Accompanied byall the citizens, as at Corinth and Chalcis, he pursued his route intoThessaly, where the states were not only to be set at liberty, butalso to be reduced from a state of utter anarchy and confusion intosome tolerable order; for they had been thrown into confusion,not only through the faults of the times, and the violence andlicentiousness of royalty, but also through the restless dispositionof the nation, who, from the earliest times, even to our days,have never conducted any election, or assembly, or council, withoutdissensions and tumult. He chose both senators and judges, withregard, principally, to their property, and made that party the mostpowerful in the state to whom it was most important that all thingsshould be tranquil and secure."Book 34,Chapter 52,"When he had completed these regulations in Thessaly, he went on,through Epirus, to Oricum, whence he intended to take his passage.From Oricum all the troops were transported to Brundusium. From thisplace to the city, they passed the whole length of Italy, in a manner,like a triumph; the captured effects which they brought with themforming a train as large as that of the troops themselves. When theyarrived at Rome, the senate assembled outside the city, to receivefrom Quinctius a recital of his services; and, with high satisfaction,a well-merited triumph was decreed him. His triumph lasted three days.On the first day were carried in procession, armour, weapons, brazenand marble statues of which he had taken greater numbers from Philipthan from the states of Greece. On the second, gold and silverwrought, unwrought, and coined. Of unwrought silver, there wereeighteen thousand pounds' weight; and of wrought, two hundred andseventy thousand; consisting of many vessels of various sorts, most ofthem engraved, and several of exquisite workmanship; also a great manyothers made of brass; and besides these, ten shields of silver. Thecoined silver amounted to eighty-four thousand of the Attic coin,called Tetradrachmus, containing each of silver about the weight offour denarii.[1] Of gold there were three thousand seven hundred andfourteen pounds, and one shield wholly of gold: and of the gold coincalled Philippics, fourteen thousand five hundred and fourteen.[2]On the third day were carried golden crowns, presented by the severalstates, in number one hundred and fourteen; then the victims. Beforehis chariot went many illustrious persons, captives and hostages,among whom were Demetrius, son of king Philip, and Armenes, aLacedaemonian, son of the tyrant Nabis. Then Quinctius himself rodeinto the city, followed by a numerous body of soldiers, as thewhole army had been brought home from the province. Among these hedistributed two hundred and fifty _asses_[3] to each footman, doubleto a centurion, triple to a horseman. Those who had been redeemed fromcaptivity added to the grandeur of the procession, walking after himwith their heads shaven."Book 34,Chapter 53,"In the latter part of this year Quintus Aelius Tubero, plebeiantribune, in pursuance of a decree of the senate, proposed to thepeople, and the people ordered, that ""two Latin colonies should besettled, one in Bruttium, the other in the territory of Thurium."" Formaking these settlements commissioners were appointed, who were tohold the office for three years; for Bruttium, Quintus Naevius, MarcusMinucius Rufus, and Marcus Furius Crassipes; and for the districtof Thurium, Cneius Manlius, Quintus Aelius, and Lucius Apustius. Theassemblies of election to these two appointments were held in theCapitol by Cneius Domitius, city praetor. Several temples werededicated this year: one of Juno Sospita, in the herb market, vowedand contracted for four years before, in the time of the Gallicwar, by Cneius Cornelius, consul; and the same person, now censor,performed the dedication. Another of Faunus, the building of whichhad been agreed for two years before, and a fund formed for it out offines estreated by the aediles, Caius Scribonius and Cneius Domitius;the latter of whom, now city praetor, dedicated it. Quintus MarciusRalla, constituted commissioner for the purpose, dedicated the templeof Fortuna Primigenia, on the Quirinal Hill. Publius Sempronius Sophushad vowed this temple ten years before, in the Punic war; and, beingafterwards censor, had employed persons to build it. Caius Servilius,duumvir, also dedicated a temple of Jupiter, in the island. Thishad been vowed in the Gallic war, six years before, by LuciusFurius Purpureo, who afterwards, when consul, contracted for thebuilding.--Such were the transactions of that year."Book 34,Chapter 54,"Publius Scipio came home from his province of Gaul to choose newconsuls. The consular comitia were accordingly held, in which LuciusCornelius Merula and Quintus Minucius Thermus were chosen. Nextday were chosen praetors, Lucius Cornelius Scipio, Marcus FulviusNobilior, Caius Scribonius, Marcus Valerius Messala, Lucius PorciusLicinus, and Caius Flaminius. The curule aediles of this year, CaiusAtilius Serranus and Lucius Scribonius, first exhibited the Megalesiantheatrical games. At the Roman games, celebrated by these aediles, thesenators, for the first time, sat separate from the people, which, asevery innovation usually does, gave occasion to various observations.Some considered this as ""an honour, shown at length to that mostrespectable body, and which ought to have been done long before;""while others contended, that ""every addition made to the grandeur ofthe senate was a diminution of the dignity of the people; and that allsuch distinctions as set the orders of the state at a distance fromeach other, were equally subversive of liberty and concord. Duringfive hundred and fifty-eight years,"" they asserted, ""all thespectators had sat promiscuously: what reason then had now occurred,on a sudden, that should make the senators disdain to have the commonsintermixed with them in the theatre, or make the rich disdain the poorman as a fellow-spectator? It was an unprecedented gratificationof pride and over-bearing vanity, never even desired, and neverinstituted, by the senate of any other nation."" It is said, that evenAfricanus himself at last became sorry for having proposed that matterin his consulship: so difficult is it to bring people to approve ofany alteration of ancient customs; they are always naturally disposedto adhere to old practices, except those which experience evidentlycondemns."Book 34,Chapter 55,"In the beginning of the year, which was the consulate of LuciusCornelius and Quintus Minucius, such frequent reports of earthquakeswere brought, that people grew weary, not only of the matter itself,but of the religious rites enjoined in consequence; for neither couldthe senate be convened, nor the business of the public be transacted,the consuls were so constantly employed in sacrifices and expiations.At last, the decemvirs were ordered to consult the books; and, inpursuance of their answer, a supplication was performed during threedays. People offered prayers at all the shrines, with garlandson their heads; and an order was published, that all the personsbelonging to one family should pay their worship together; and theconsuls, by direction of the senate, published an edict, that, on anyday whereon religious rites should be ordered, in consequence of thereport of an earthquake, no person should report another earthquakeon that day. Then the consuls first, and afterwards the praetors, castlots for their provinces. Cornelius obtained Gaul; Minucius, Liguria;Caius Scribonius, the city jurisdiction; Marcus Valerius, the foreign;Lucius Cornelius, Sicily; Lucius Porcius, Sardinia; Caius Flaminius,Hither Spain; and Marcus Fulvius, Farther Spain."Book 34,Chapter 56,"While the consuls supposed that, for that year, they should haveno employment of a military kind, a letter was brought from MarcusCincius, who was commander at Pisae, announcing, that ""twenty thousandarmed Ligurians, in consequence of a conspiracy of that whole nation,formed in the meetings of their several districts, had first wastedthe lands of Luna, and then, passing through the territory of Pisae,had overrun the whole sea-coast."" In consequence of this intelligence,the consul Minucius, whose province Liguria was, by direction ofthe senate, mounted the rostrum, and published orders, that ""the twolegions, enlisted the year before, should, on the tenth day from that,attend him at Arretium;"" and mentioned his intention of levying twolegions for the city in their stead. He likewise gave notice to themagistrates and ambassadors of such of the allies, and of the Latinconfederates, as were bound to furnish soldiers, to attend him in theCapitol. Of these he wrote out a list, amounting to fifteen thousandfoot and five hundred horse, proportioning the contingent of eachstate to the number of its young men, and ordered those present togo directly from the spot to the gate of the city; and, in order toexpedite the business, to proceed to raise the men. To Fulvius andFlaminius were assigned, to each three thousand Roman foot, and areinforcement of one hundred horse, with five thousand foot of theLatin allies, and two hundred horse; and orders were given to thosepraetors, to disband the old troops immediately on their arrival intheir provinces. Although great numbers of the soldiers belonging tothe city legions had made application to the plebeian tribunes, totake cognizance of the cases of such men as claimed exemption from theservice, on account either of having served out their time, or of badhealth; yet a letter from Tiberius Sempronius banished all thoughts ofsuch proceeding; for in this it was announced that ""fifteen thousandof the Ligurians had come into the lands of Placentia, and wasted themwith fire and sword, to the very walls of that city and the bank ofthe Po; and that the Boian nation were looking out for an occasion torebel."" In consequence of this information, the senate passed a vote,that ""there was a Gallic tumult subsisting, and that it would beimproper for the plebeian tribunes to take cognizance of the claimsof the soldiers, so as to prevent their attending, pursuant to theproclamation;"" and they added an order, that the Latin confederates,who had served in the army of Publius Cornelius and TiberiusSempronius, and had been discharged by those consuls, shouldre-assemble, on whatever day and in whatever place of Etruria theconsul Lucius Cornelius should appoint; and that the consul LuciusCornelius, on his way to his province, should enlist, arm, and carrywith him all such persons as he should think fit, in the several townsand countries through which he was to pass, and should have authorityto discharge such of them, and at such times, as he might judgeproper."Book 34,Chapter 57,"After the consuls had finished the levies, and were gone to theirprovinces, Titus Quinctius demanded, that ""the senate should receivean account of the regulations which he in concert with the tenambassadors, had settled; and, if they thought proper, ratify them bytheir authority."" He told them, that ""they would accomplish this themore easily, if they were first to give audience to the ambassadors,who had come from all parts of Greece, and a great part of Asia, andto those from the two kings."" These embassies were introduced to thesenate by the city praetor, Caius Scribonius, and all received kindanswers. As the discussion of the affair with Antiochus required toomuch time, it was referred to the ten ambassadors, some of whom hadconferred with the king in Asia, or at Lysimachia. Directions weregiven to Titus Quinctius, that, in conjunction with these, he shouldlisten to the representations of the king's ambassadors, and shouldgive them such answer as comported with the dignity and interestof the Roman people. At the head of the embassy were Menippus andHegesianax; the former of whom said, that ""he could not conceive whatintricacy there was in the business of their embassy, as they camesimply to ask friendship, and conclude an alliance. Now, there werethree kinds of treaties, by which kings and states formed friendshipswith each other: one, when terms were dictated to a people vanquishedin war; for after all their possessions have been surrendered to himwho has proved superior in war, he has the sole power of judging anddetermining what portion of them the vanquished shall hold, and ofwhat they shall be deprived. The second, when parties, equallymatched in war, conclude a treaty of peace and friendship on termsof equality; for then demands are proposed and restitution made,reciprocally, in a convention; and if, in consequence of the war,confusion has arisen with respect to any parts of their properties,the matter is adjusted on the footing either of ancient right orof the mutual convenience of the parties. The third kind was, whenparties who had never been foes, met to form a friendly union by asocial treaty: these neither dictate nor receive terms, for that isthe case between a victor and a party vanquished. As Antiochus cameunder this last description, he wondered, he said, that the Romansshould think it becoming to dictate terms to him; as to which of thecities of Asia they chose should be free and independent, which shouldbe tributary, and which of them the king's troops and the king himselfshould be prohibited to enter. That a peace of this kind mightbe ratified with Philip, who was their enemy, but not a treaty ofalliance with Antiochus, their friend."""Book 34,Chapter 58,"To this Quinctius answered: ""Since you choose to dealmethodically, and enumerate the several modes of contractingalliances, I also will lay down two conditions, without which you maytell your king, that there are no means of contracting any friendshipwith the Roman people. One, that, he does not choose that we shouldconcern ourselves in the affairs of the cities in Asia, he musthimself keep entirely out of Europe. The other, that if he doesnot confine himself within the limits of Asia, but passes over intoEurope, the Romans will think themselves at full liberty to maintainthe friendships which they have already formed with the states ofAsia, and also to contract new ones."" On this Hegesianax exclaimed,that ""this proposition was unworthy to be listened to, as itstendency was to exclude Antiochus from the cities of Thrace andthe Chersonese,--places which his great-grandfather, Seleucus, hadacquired with great honour, after vanquishing Lysimachus in war andkilling him in battle, and had left to his successors; and part ofwhich, after they had been seized by the Thracians, Antiochus had,with equal honour, recovered by force of arms; as well as others whichhad been deserted,--as Lysimachia, for instance, he had repeopled, bycalling home the inhabitants;--and several, which had been destroyedby fire, and buried in ruins, he had rebuilt at a vast expense. Whatkind of resemblance was there, then, in the cases of Antiochus beingejected from possessions so acquired and so recovered; and of theRomans refraining from intermeddling with Asia, which had never beentheirs? Antiochus wished to obtain the friendship of the Romans; butso that its acquisition would be to his honour, and not to his shame.""In reply to this, Quinctius said,--""Since we are deliberating on whatwould be honourable, and which, indeed with a people who held thefirst rank among the nations of the world, and with so great a king,ought to be the sole, or at least the primary object of regard; tellme, I pray you, which do you think more honourable, to wish to giveliberty to all the Grecian cities in every part of the world; or tomake them slaves and vassals? Since Antiochus thinks it conduciveto his glory, to reduce to slavery those cities, which hisgreat-grandfather held by the right of arms, but which his grandfatheror father never occupied as their property while the Roman people,having undertaken the patronage of the liberty of the Greeks, deem itincumbent on their faith and constancy not to abandon it. As theyhave delivered Greece from Philip, so they have it in contemplationto deliver, from Antiochus, all the states of Asia which are of theGrecian race. For colonies were not sent into Aeolia and Ionia to beenslaved to kings; but with design to increase the population, and topropagate that ancient race in every part of the globe."""Book 34,Chapter 59,"When Hegesianax hesitated, and could not deny, that the causeof liberty carried a more honourable semblance than that of slavery,Publius Sulpicius, who was the eldest of the ten ambassadors,said,--""Let us cut the matter short. Choose one of the two conditionsclearly propounded just now by Quinctius; or deem it superfluous tonegotiate about an alliance."" But Menippus replied, ""We neither will,nor can, accede to any proposition by which the dominions ofAntiochus would be diminished."" Next day, Quinctius brought into thesenate-house all the ambassadors of Greece and Asia, in order thatthey might learn the dispositions entertained by the Roman people, andby Antiochus, towards the Grecian states. He then acquainted them withhis own demands, and those of the king; and desired them to ""assuretheir respective states, that the same disinterested zeal and courage,which the Roman people had displayed in defence of their libertyagainst the encroachments of Philip, they would, likewise, exertagainst those of Antiochus, if he should refuse to retire out ofEurope."" On this, Menippus earnestly besought Quinctius and thesenate, ""not to be hasty in forming their determination, which, in itseffects, might disturb the peace of the whole world; to take timeto themselves, and allow the king time for consideration; that, wheninformed of the conditions proposed, he would consider them, andeither obtain some relaxation in the terms, or accede to them for thesake of peace."" Accordingly, the business was deferred entire; anda resolution passed, that the same ambassadors should be sent to theking who had attended him at Lysimachia,--Publius Sulpicius, PubliusVillius, and Publius Aelius."Book 34,Chapter 60,"Scarcely had these begun their journey, when ambassadors fromCarthage brought information, that Antiochus was evidently preparingfor war, and that Hannibal was employed in his service; which gavereason to fear, that a Punic war might break out at the same time.Hannibal, on leaving his own country, had gone to Antiochus, as wasmentioned before, and was held by the king in high estimation, notso much for his other qualifications, as because, to a person who hadlong been revolving schemes for a war with Rome, there could not beany fitter participator of his counsels on such a subject. His opinionwas always one and the same, that the war should be carried on inItaly: because ""Italy would supply a foreign enemy both with men andprovisions; but, if it were left in quiet, and the Roman people wereallowed to employ the strength and forces of Italy, in making warbeyond the limits of that country, no king or nation would be able tocope with them."" He demanded, for himself, one hundred decked ships,ten thousand foot, and one thousand horse. ""With this force,"" he said,""he would first repair to Africa; and he had confident hopes, that heshould be able to prevail on the Carthaginians to revive hostilities.If they should hesitate, he would raise a war against the Romans insome part of Italy. That the king ought to cross over into Europe withall the rest of his force, and keep his army in some part of Greece;not to pass over immediately into Italy, but to be in readiness to doso; which would sufficiently conduce to the imposing character and thereported magnitude of the war."""Book 34,Chapter 61,"When he had brought the king to agree in his opinion, he judged itnecessary to predispose the minds of his countrymen to the same;but he durst not send a letter, lest it might, by some accident, beintercepted, and his plans by that means, be discovered. He had foundat Ephesus a Tyrian called Aristo, and in several less importantcommissions, had discovered him to possess a good degree of ingenuity.This man he now loaded with presents and promises of rewards whichwere confirmed by the king himself, and sent him to Carthage withmessages. He told him the names of the persons whom it was necessarythat he should see, and furnished him with secret tokens, by whichthey would know, with certainty, that the messages came from him. Onthis Aristo's appearing at Carthage, the reason of his coming was notdiscovered by Hannibal's friends sooner than by his enemies. At first,the subject was bruited about in their circles and at their tables;and at last some persons declared in the senate that ""the banishmentof Hannibal answered no purpose, if while resident in anothercountry, he was still able to propagate designs for changingthe administration, and disturbing the quiet of the state by hisintrigues. That a Tyrian stranger, named Aristo, had come with acommission from Hannibal and king Antiochus; that certain men dailyheld secret conferences with him, and were concocting that in private,the consequences of which would soon break out, to the ruin of thepublic."" This produced a general outcry, that ""Aristo ought to besummoned, and examined respecting the reason of his coming; and if hedid not disclose it, to be sent to Rome, with ambassadors accompanyinghim: that they had already suffered enough of punishment in atonementof the headstrong rashness of one individual; that the faults ofprivate citizens should be at their own risk, and the state should bepreserved free, not only from guilt, but even from the suspicion ofit."" Aristo, being summoned, contended for his innocence; and urged,as his strongest defence, that he had brought no letter to any personwhatever: but he gave no satisfactory reason for his coming, andwas chiefly embarrassed by the fact which they urged, that he hadconversed solely with men of the Barcine faction. A warm debateensued; some earnestly pressing, that he should be immediately seizedas a spy, and kept in custody; while others insisted, that therewere not sufficient grounds for such violent measures; that ""puttingstrangers into confinement, without reason, was a step that afforded abad precedent; for that the same would happen to the Carthaginians atTyre, and other marts, where they frequently traded."" The questionwas adjourned on that day. Aristo practised on the Carthaginiansa Carthaginian artifice; for having early in the evening hung up awritten tablet, in the most frequented place of the city, over thetribunal where the magistrates daily sat, he went on board his ship atthe third watch, and fled. Next day, when the suffetes had taken theirseats to administer justice, the tablet was observed, taken down,and read. Its contents were, that ""Aristo came not with a privatecommission to any person, but with a public one to the elders;"" bythis name they called the senate. The imputation being thus thrownon the state, less pains were taken in searching into the suspicionsharboured of a few individuals: however, it was determined, thatambassadors should be sent to Rome, to represent the affair to theconsuls and the senate, and, at the same time, to complain of theinjuries received from Masinissa."Book 34,Chapter 62,"When Masinissa observed that the Carthaginians were looked on withjealousy by others, and were full of dissensions among themselves; thenobles being suspected by the senate, on account of their conferenceswith Aristo, and the senate by the people, in consequence of theinformation given by the same Aristo, he thought that, at such aconjuncture, he might successfully encroach on their rights; andaccordingly he laid waste their country along the sea-coast, andcompelled several cities, which were tributary to the Carthaginians,to pay their taxes to him. This tract they call Emporia; it forms theshore of the lesser Syrtis, and has a fertile soil; one of its citiesis Leptis, which paid a tribute to the Carthaginians of a talent aday. At this time, Masinissa not only ravaged that whole tract, but,with respect to a considerable part of it, disputed the right ofpossession with the Carthaginians; and when he learned that they weresending to Rome, both to justify their conduct, and, at the same time,to make complaints of him, he likewise sent ambassadors to Rome, toload them with suspicions, and to discuss the right to the taxes.The Carthaginians were heard first, and their account of the Tyrianstranger gave the senate no small uneasiness, as they dreaded beinginvolved in war with Antiochus and the Carthaginians at the same time.What contributed chiefly to strengthen a suspicion of evil designs,was, that though they had resolved to seize Aristo, and send him toRome, they had not placed a guard either on himself or his ship. Thenbegan the controversy with the king's ambassadors, on the claims ofthe territory in dispute. The Carthaginians supported their cause bya boundary claim, urging that ""It must belong to them, as being withinthe limits which Scipio, after conquering the country, had fixed asthe boundaries which should be under Carthaginian rule; and also, bythe acknowledgment of the king, who, when he was going in pursuit ofAphir, a fugitive from his kingdom, then hovering about Cyrene, witha party of Numidians, had solicited as a favour a passage throughthat very district, as being confessedly a part of the Carthaginiandominions."" The Numidians insisted, ""that they were guilty ofmisrepresentation with respect to the limits fixed by Scipio; and if aperson chose to recur to the real origin of their property, what titlehad the Carthaginians to call any land in Africa their own: foreignersand strangers, to whom had been granted precariously, for the purposeof building a city, as much ground as they could encompass with thecuttings of a bull's hide? Whatever acquisitions they had made beyondByrsa, their original settlement, they held by fraud and violence;for, in relation to the land in question, so far were they from beingable to prove uninterrupted possession, from the time when it wasfirst acquired, that they cannot even prove that they ever possessedit for any considerable time. As occasions offered, sometimes they,sometimes the kings of Numidia, had held the dominion of it; andthe possession of it had always been held by the party which had thegreatest armed force. They requested the senate to suffer thematter to remain on the same footing on which it stood before theCarthaginians became enemies to the Romans, or the king of Numidiatheir friend and ally; and not to interfere, so as to hinder whicheverparty was able, from keeping possession.""--The senate resolved to tellthe ambassadors of both parties, that they would send persons intoAfrica to determine the present controversy between the people ofCarthage and the king. They accordingly sent Publius Scipio Africanus,Caius Cornelius Cethegus, and Marcus Minucius Rufus; who, afterviewing the ground, and hearing what could be said on both sides, leftevery thing in suspense, their opinions inclining neither to oneside nor the other. Whether they acted in this manner from their ownjudgment, or because they had been so instructed, is by no means socertain as it is, that as affairs were circumstanced, it was highlyexpedient to leave the dispute undecided: for, had the case beenotherwise, Scipio alone, either from his own knowledge of thebusiness, or the influence which he possessed, and to which he hada just claim on both parties, could, with a nod, have ended thecontroversy."Book 35,Chapter 1,"In the beginning of the same year, Sextus Digitius, praetor in theHither Spain, fought with those states which, after the departure ofMarcus Cato, had, in great numbers, recommenced hostilities, numerousbattles, but none deserving of particular mention; and all sounfavourable to him, that he scarcely delivered to his successor halfthe number of men that he had received. In consequence of this, everystate in Spain would certainly have resumed new courage, had notthe other praetor, Publius Cornelius Scipio, son of Cneius, beensuccessful in several engagements on the other side of the Iberus;and, by these means, diffused such a general terror, that no less thanfifty towns came over to his side. These exploits Scipio performedin his praetorship. Afterwards, when propraetor, as the Lusitanians,after ravaging the farther Province, were returning home, with animmense booty, he attacked them on their march, and continued theengagement from the third hour of the day to the eighth, before anyadvantage was gained on either side. He was inferior to the enemy innumber of men, but he had the advantage of them in other respects:with his troops formed in a compact body he attacked a long train,encumbered with multitudes of cattle; and with his soldiers fresh,engaged men, fatigued by a long march; for the enemy had set out atthe third watch, and besides travelling the remainder of the night,had continued their route to the third hour of the day; nor had theybeen allowed any rest, as the battle immediately succeeded the toilof the march. Wherefore, though at the beginning they retained somevigour of body and spirits, and, at first, threw the Romans intodisorder, yet, after some time, the fight became equal. In thiscritical situation the propraetor made a vow to celebrate games inhonour of Jupiter, in case he should defeat and cut off the enemy. TheRomans then made a more vigorous push, and the Lusitanians gave way,and, in a little time, turned their backs. As the victors pursued thembriskly, no less than twelve thousand of them were slain, and fivehundred and forty taken prisoners, most of whom were horsemen. Therewere taken, besides, a hundred and thirty-four military standards. Ofthe Roman army, but seventy-three men were lost. The battle was foughtat a small distance from the city of Ilipa. Thither Publius Corneliusled back his victorious army, amply enriched with spoil; all which wasexposed to view under the walls of the town, and permission givento the owners to claim their effects. The remainder was put into thehands of the quaestor to be sold, and the money produced by the salewas distributed among the soldiers."Book 35,Chapter 2,"At the time when these occurrences happened in Spain, CaiusFlaminius, the praetor, had not yet set out from Rome: therefore theseevents, as well prosperous as adverse, were reported by himself andhis friends in the strongest representations; and he laboured topersuade the senate, that, as a very formidable war had blazed out inhis province, and he was likely to receive from Sextus Digitius a verysmall remnant of an army, and that, too, terrified and disheartenedthey ought to decree one of the city legions to him, in order that,when he should have united to it the soldiers levied by himself,pursuant to the decree of the senate, he might select from the wholenumber six thousand five hundred foot and three hundred horse. Hesaid, that ""with such a legion as that, (for very little confidencecould be placed on the troops of Sextus Digitius,) he would conductthe war."" But the elder part of the senate insisted, that ""decrees ofthe senate were not to be passed in consequence of rumours fabricatedby private persons for the gratification of magistrates; and that nointelligence should be deemed authentic except it were either writtenby the praetors, from their provinces, or brought by their deputies.If there was a tumultuous commotion in Spain, they advised a vote,that tumultuary soldiers should be levied by the praetor in some othercountry than Italy."" The senate's intention was that such descriptionof men should be raised in Spain. Valerius Antias says, that CaiusFlaminius sailed to Sicily for the purpose of levying troops, andthat, on his voyage thence to Spain, being driven by a storm toAfrica, he enlisted there many stragglers who had belonged to thearmy of Publius Africanus; and that, to the levies made in those twoprovinces, he added a third in Spain."Book 35,Chapter 3,"In Italy the war, commenced by the Ligurians, grew daily moreformidable. They now invested Pisae, with an army of forty thousandmen; for multitudes flocked to them continually, led by the reportsof the war and the expectation of booty. The consul, Minucius, cameto Arretium, on the day which he had fixed for the assembling of thetroops. Thence he led them, in order of battle, towards Pisae; andthough the enemy had removed their camp to the other side of theriver, at a distance of no more than three miles from the place, theconsul marched into the city, which evidently owed its preservation tohis coming. Next day he also encamped on the other side of the river,about a mile from the enemy; and by slight skirmishes protected thelands of the allies from their depredations. He did not think itprudent to hazard a general engagement, because his troops were raw,composed of many different kinds of men, and not yet so well knownamong themselves that they could rely on one another. The Liguriansdepended so much on their numbers, that they not only came out andoffered battle, willing to risk every thing on the issue of it; but,from their superfluity of men, they sent out many parties along thefrontiers to plunder; and whenever a large quantity of cattle, andother prey, was collected, there was an escort always in readiness toconvey it to their forts and towns."Book 35,Chapter 4,"While the operations remained at a stand at Pisae, the otherconsul, Lucius Cornelius Merula, led his army through the extremeborders of the Ligurians, into the territory of the Boians, where themode of proceeding was quite the reverse of that which took place inthe war of Liguria. The consul took the field; the enemy refused tofight; and the Romans, when no one would come out against them, wentout in parties to plunder, while the Boians chose to let their countrybe laid waste with impunity rather than venture an engagement indefence of it. When all places were completely ravaged with fireand sword, the consul quitted the enemy's lands, and marched towardsMutina, in a careless manner, as through a pacific population. TheBoians, when they learned that the enemy had withdrawn beyondtheir frontiers, followed him as secretly as possible, watching anopportunity for an ambuscade; and, having gone by his camp in thenight, took possession of a defile through which the Romans wereto pass. But as they were not able to effect this with sufficientsecrecy, the consul, who usually began his march late in the night,now waited until day, lest, in the disorderly fight likely to ensue,darkness might increase the confusion; and though he did not stirbefore it was light, yet he sent forward a troop of horse to explorethe country. When intelligence was brought by them of the number andsituation of the enemy, he ordered the baggage to be heaped togetherin the centre, and the veterans to throw up a rampart round it;and then, with the rest of the army in order of battle, he advancedtowards the enemy. The Gauls did the same, when they found that theirstratagem was detected, and that they were to engage in a fair andregular battle, where success must depend on valour alone."Book 35,Chapter 5,"The battle began about the second hour. The left brigade of theallies, and the Extraordinaries, fought in the first line, and werecommanded by two lieutenant-generals of consular dignity, MarcusMarcellus and Tiberius Sempronius, who had been consul the yearbefore. The present consul was sometimes employed in the front ofthe line, sometimes in keeping back the legions in reserve, that theymight not, through eagerness for fighting, come up to the attack untilthe signal was given. He ordered the two Minucii, Quintus and Publius,military tribunes, to lead off the cavalry on the legions into openground, at some distance from the line; and ""when he should give themthe signal, to charge the enemy through the clear space."" While he wasthus employed, a message came from Tiberius Sempronius Longus, thatthe Extraordinaries could not support the onset of the Gauls; thatgreat numbers had already fallen; and that partly through weariness,partly through fear, the ardour of the survivors was much abated. Herecommended it therefore to the consul, if he thought proper, to sendup one or other of the two legions, before the army suffered disgrace.The second legion was accordingly sent, and the Extraordinaries wereordered to retire. By the legion coming up, with its men fresh,and the ranks complete in their numbers, the fight was renewed withvigour. The left wing was withdrawn out of the action, and the righttook its place in the van. The intense heat of the sun discomposedthe Gauls, whose bodies were very ill qualified to endure it:nevertheless, keeping their ranks close, and leaning sometimes on eachother, sometimes on their bucklers, they withstood the attack ofthe Romans; which, when the consul observed, in order to break theirranks, he ordered Caius Livius Salinator, commander of the alliedcavalry, to charge them at full speed, and the legionary cavalryto remain in reserve. This tempest of cavalry first confused anddisordered, and at length entirely broke the line of the Gauls; yet itdid not make them fly. That was prevented by their officers, who, whenthey quitted their posts, struck them on the back with their spears,and compelled them to return to their ranks: but the allied cavalry,riding in among them, did not suffer them to recover their order.The consul exhorted his soldiers to ""continue their efforts a littlelonger, for victory was within their reach; to press the enemy, whilethey saw them disordered and dismayed; for, if they were suffered torecover their ranks, they would enter on a fresh battle with doubtfulsuccess."" He ordered the standard-bearers to advance with thestandards, and then, all exerting themselves at once, they at lengthforced the enemy to give way. As soon as they turned their backs, andfled precipitately oh every side, the legionary cavalry was sent inpursuit of them. On that day, fourteen thousand of the Boians wereslain; one thousand and ninety-two taken--as were seven hundred andtwenty-one horsemen, and three of their commanders, with two hundredand twelve military standards, and sixty-three chariots. Nor did theRomans gain the victory without loss of blood: of themselves, or theirallies, were lost above five thousand men, twenty-three centurions,four prefects of the allies, and two military tribunes of the secondlegion, Marcus Genucius and Marcus Marcius."Book 35,Chapter 6,"Letters from both the consuls arrived at Rome nearly at the sametime. That of Lucius Cornelius gave an account of the battle foughtwith the Boians at Mutina; that of Quintus Minucius, from Pisae,mentioned, that ""the holding of the elections had fallen to his lot,but that affairs in Liguria were in so uncertain a position, thathe could not depart thence without bringing ruin on the allies, andmaterial injury on the commonwealth. He therefore advised that, if thesenate thought proper, they should direct his colleague (as his warwas decided) to return to Rome for the elections. He said if Corneliusshould object to this, because that employment had not fallen to hislot, he would certainly do whatever the senate should order; but hebegged them to consider again and again whether it would not be moreto the advantage of the republic, that an interregnum should takeplace, than that the province should be left by him in such a state.""The senate gave directions to Caius Scribonius to send two deputies ofsenatorian rank to the consul, Lucius Cornelius, to communicate to himthe letter sent by his colleague to the senate, and to acquaint him,that if he did not come to Rome to elect new magistrates, the senatewere resolved, rather than Quintus Minucius should be called away froma war, in which no progress had been made, to suffer an interregnum totake place. The deputies sent brought back his answer, that hewould come to Rome, to elect new magistrates. The letter of LuciusCornelius, which contained an account of the battle with theBoians, occasioned a debate in the senate; for Marcus Claudius,lieutenant-general, in private letters to many of the senators, hadwritten, ""that they might thank the fortune of the Roman people, andthe bravery of the soldiers, that the affair had been successful. Thatthe conduct of the consul had been the cause of a great many menbeing lost, and of the enemy's army, for the annihilation of which anopportunity had been offered, having made its escape. That what madethe loss of men the greater was, the reinforcements, necessary tosupport them when distressed, coming up too late from the reserve;and that, what enabled the enemy to slip out of their hands was, thesignal being given too tardily to the legionary cavalry, and theirnot being allowed to pursue the fugitives."" It was agreed, that noresolution should be hastily passed on the subject; and the discussionwas accordingly adjourned to a fuller meeting."Book 35,Chapter 7,"Another concern also pressed upon them, namely, that the publicwas heavily distressed by usurious practices; and although avarice hadbeen restricted by many laws respecting usury, yet a fraudulent coursehad been adopted--that of transferring the securities to subjects ofsome of the allied states, who were not bound by those laws, by whichmeans usurers overwhelmed their debtors by unlimited interest. Onconsidering of the best method for putting a stop to this evil thesenate decreed, that a certain day should be fixed on for it, thenext approaching festival of the infernal deities; and that any ofthe allies who should from that day lend money to the Roman citizens,should register the transaction; and that all proceedings respectingsuch money, lent after that day, should be regulated by the laws ofwhichever of the two states the debtor should choose. In some timeafter, when the great amount of debt, contracted through this kind offraud, was discovered by means of the registries, Marcus Sempronius,plebeian tribune, by direction of the senate, proposed to the people,and the people ordered, that the laws relative to money lent betweenRoman citizens and subjects of any of the allied states, or Latinconfederacy, should be the same as those between Roman citizens. Suchwere the transactions in Italy, civil and military. In Spain the warwas far from being so formidable as the exaggerations of report hadrepresented it. In Hither Spain, Caius Flaminius took the town ofIlucia, in the country of the Oretanians, and then marched his armyinto winter quarters. Several engagements took place during thewinter, but none deserving of particular mention, directed againstincursions of robbers rather than of the enemy; and yet with varioussuccess, and not without the loss of some men. More important serviceswere performed by Marcus Fulvius. He fought a pitched battle near thetown of Toletum, against the Vaccaeans, Vectonians, and Celtiberians;routed and dispersed their combined forces, and took prisoner theirking, Hilermus."Book 35,Chapter 8,"While this passed in Spain, the day of election was drawingnear. Lucius Cornelius, therefore, the consul, left Marcus Claudius,lieutenant-general, in command of the army and came to Rome. Afterrepresenting in the senate the services which he had performed, andthe present state of the province, he expostulated with the conscriptfathers on their not having ordered a thanksgiving to the immortalgods when so great a war was so happily terminated by one successfulbattle; and then demanded, that they would at the same time decree asupplication and a triumph. But, before the question was put, QuintusMetellus, who had been consul and dictator, said, that, ""letters hadbeen brought at the same time from the consul, Lucius Cornelius,to the senate, and from Marcus Marcellus, to a great part of thesenators; which letters contradicted each other, and for that reasonthe consideration of the business had been adjourned, in order that itmight be debated when the writers of those letters should he present.He had expected, therefore, that the consul, who knew that thelieutenant-general had written something to his disadvantage, would,when he himself was obliged to come, have brought him with himto Rome; especially, as the command of the army would, with morepropriety, have been committed to Tiberius Sempronius, who alreadypossessed authority, than to the lieutenant-general. As the casestood at present, it appeared as if the latter was kept out of the waydesignedly, lest he might assert in person the same things which hehad written in his letters; and, face to face, either substantiatehis charges, or, if he had alleged any thing untrue, be convicted ofmisrepresentation, until the truth should be clearly discovered. Forthis reason he was of opinion, that the senate should not, at present,assent to either of the decrees demanded by the consul."" When he,however, persisted with undiminished energy in putting the question,that a thanksgiving should be ordered, and himself allowed to rideinto the city in triumph; the plebeian tribunes, Marcus and CaiusTitinius, declared, that they would enter their protest, if the senatepassed any decree on the subject."Book 35,Chapter 9,"In the preceding year, Sextus Aelius Paetus and Caius CorneliusCethegus were created censors. Cornelius now closed the lustrum. Thenumber of citizens rated was a hundred and forty-three thousand sevenhundred and four. Extraordinary quantities of rain fell in thisyear, and the Tiber overflowed the lower parts of the city; andsome buildings near the Flumentan gate were even laid in ruins. TheCoelimontan gate was struck by lightning, as was the wall on each sideof it, in several places. At Aricia, Lanuvium, and on the Aventine,showers of stones fell. From Capua, a report was brought that a verylarge swarm of wasps flew into the forum, and settled on the temple ofMars; that they had been carefully collected, and burnt. On account ofthese prodigies, the decemvirs were ordered to consult the books; thenine days' festival was celebrated, a supplication proclaimed, andthe city purified. At the same time, Marcus Porcius Cato dedicated achapel to Maiden Victory, near the temple of Victory, two years afterhe had vowed it. During this year, a Latin colony was establishedin the Thurian territory by commissioners appointed for the purpose,Cneius Manlius Vulso, Lucius Apustius Fullo, and Quintus AeliusTubero, who had proposed the order for its settlement. There went outthither three thousand foot and three hundred horsemen; a very smallnumber in proportion to the extent of the land. Thirty acres mighthave been given to each footman, and sixty to a horseman, but, bythe advice of Apustius, a third part was reserved, that they mightafterwards, when they should judge proper, send out thither a newcolony. The footmen received twenty acres each, the horsemen forty."Book 35,Chapter 10,"The year was now near a close, and with regard to the electionof consuls, emulation was more fiercely kindled than was ever knownbefore. The candidates, both patrician and plebeian, were many andpowerful: Publius Cornelius Scipio, son to Cneius, and who hadlately come home from Spain, having performed great exploits; LuciusQuinctius Flamininus, who had commanded the fleet in Greece; andCneius Manlius Vulso; these were the patricians. Then there were, ofplebeian rank, Caius Laelius, Cneius Domitius, Caius Livius Salinator,and Manius Acilius. The eyes of all men were turned on Quinctius andCornelius; for, being both patricians, they sued for one place; andthey were both of them recommended by high and recent renown in war.Above every thing else, the brothers of the candidates, the twomost illustrious generals of the age, increased the violence of thestruggle. Scipio's fame was the more splendid, and in proportion toits greater splendour, the more obnoxious to envy. That of Quinctiuswas the most recent, as he had triumphed in the course of that verysame year. Besides, the former had now for almost ten years beencontinually in people's sight; which circumstance, by the mere effectof satiety, causes great characters to be less revered. He had beena second time consul after the final defeat of Hannibal, and alsocensor. All Quinctius's claims to the favour of the public were freshand new; since his triumph, he had neither asked nor received anythingfrom the people; ""he solicited,"" he said, ""in favour of his ownbrother, not of a half-brother; in favour of his lieutenant-general,and partner in the administration of the war; his brother havingconducted the operations by sea, while he did the same on land."" Bythese arguments he carried his point. His brother was preferred to thebrother of Africanus, though supported by the whole Cornelian family,and while one of the same family presided at the election, andnotwithstanding the very honourable testimony given by the senate, inhis favour, when it adjudged him to be the best man in the state: andas such, appointed him to receive the Idaean Mother into the city,when she was brought from Pessinus. Lucius Quinctius and CneiusDomitius Ahenobarbus were elected consuls; so that, not even withrespect to the plebeian consul, could Africanus prevail; for heemployed his interest in favour of Caius Laelius. Next day wereelected praetors, Lucius Scribonius Libo, Marcus Fulvius Centumalus,Aulus Atilius Serranus, Marcus Baebius Tamphilus, Lucius ValeriusTappus, and Quintus Salonius Sarra. The aedileship of this year washighly distinguished, namely, that of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus andLucius Aemilius Paulus. They prosecuted to conviction many of thefarmers of the public pastures, and with the money accruing fromthe fines, placed gilded shields in the upper part of the templeof Jupiter. They built one colonnade, on the outside of the gateTergemina, to which they added a wharf on the Tiber: and another,reaching from the Frontinal gate to the altar of Mars, to serve as apassage into the field of Mars."Book 35,Chapter 11,"For a long time, nothing worth recording had occurred in Liguria;but, towards the end of this year, the Roman affairs there were twicebrought into great peril; for the consul's camp, being assaulted, waswith difficulty preserved; and a short time after, as the Roman armywas marching through a defile, the Ligurians seized on the openingthrough which they were to pass. The consul, when he found thatpassage stopped up, faced about, resolved to return: but the entrancebehind, also, was occupied by a party of the enemy, and the disasterof Caudium not only occurred to the memory of the Romans, but was in amanner represented to their eyes. The consul had, among his auxiliarytroops, about eight hundred Numidian horsemen, whose commandingofficer undertook to force a passage with his troops, on whicheverside the consul should choose. He only desired to be told on whichpart the greater number of villages lay, for on them he meant to makean attack; and the first thing he intended doing was, to set fire tothe houses, in order that the alarm, which this should occasion, mightinduce the Ligurians to quit their posts in the defile, and hasten todifferent quarters to carry assistance to their friends. The consulhighly commended him, and gave him assurance of ample rewards. TheNumidians mounted their horses, and began to ride up to the advancedposts of the enemy, but without making any attack. Nothing couldappear, on the first view, more contemptible. Both men and horses wereof a small size and thin make, the riders unaccoutred and unarmed,excepting that they carried javelins in their hands; and the horseswithout bridles, and awkward in their gait, running with their necksstiff and their heads stretched out. The contempt, conceived fromtheir appearance, they took pains to increase; sometimes falling fromtheir horses, and making themselves objects of derision and ridicule.The consequence was, that the enemy, who at first had been alert, andready on their posts, in case of an attack, now, for the most part,laid aside their arms, and sitting down amused themselves with lookingat them. The Numidians often rode up, then galloped back, but stillcontrived to get nearer to the pass, as if they were unable to managetheir horses, and were carried away against their will. At last,setting spurs to them, they broke out through the midst of the enemy'sposts, and getting into the open country, set fire to all the housesnear the road. They then set fire to the nearest village, while theyravaged all around with fire and sword. At first the sight of thesmoke, then the shouts of the affrighted inhabitants, at last the oldpeople and children, who fled for shelter, created great disorder inthe camp. In consequence of which the whole of their army, withoutplan, and without command, ran off, each to take care of his own;the camp was in a moment deserted; and the consul delivered from theblockade, made good his march to the place whither he intended to go."Book 35,Chapter 12,"But neither the Boians nor the Spaniards, with whom they had beenat war during that year, were such bitter and inveterate foes to theRomans as the nation of the Aetolians. These, after the departure ofthe Roman armies from Greece, had, for some time, entertained hopesthat Antiochus would come and take possession of Europe, withoutopposition; and that neither Philip nor Nabis would continue quiet.But seeing no active measures begun, in any quarter, they resolved,lest their designs might be damped by delay, to create some agitationand disturbance; and, with this view, they summoned a general assemblyat Naupactum. Here Thoas, their praetor, after complaining of theinjurious behaviour of the Romans, and the present state of Aetolia,and asserting, that ""of all the nations and states of Greece, they hadbeen most unhonoured, after the victory which they themselves had beenthe means of obtaining,"" moved, that ambassadors should be sent toeach of the kings; not only to sound their dispositions, but, by suchincentives as suited the temper of each, to urge them to a warwith Rome. Damocritus was sent to Nabis, Nicander to Philip, andDicaearchus, the praetor's brother, to Antiochus. To the Lacedaemoniantyrant Damocritus represented, that, ""by the maritime cities beingtaken from him, his government was left enervated; for from them hehad drawn his soldiers, as well as his ships and seamen. He was nowpent up almost within the walls of his capital, while he saw theAchaeans domineering over the whole Peloponnesus. Never would he haveanother opportunity of recovering his rights, if he suffered the onethat now offered to pass by. There was no Roman army in Greece, norwould the Romans deem Gythium, or the other towns on the coast ofLaconia, sufficient cause for transporting their legions a secondtime into that country."" These arguments were used for the purpose ofprovoking the passions of Nabis; in order that when Antiochus shouldcome into Greece, the other, conscious of having infringed the treatyof amity with Rome, by injuries offered to its allies, might unitehimself with him. Nicander excited Philip, by arguments somewhatsimilar; and he had more copious matter for discourse, as the kinghad been degraded from a more elevated state than the tyrant, andmore possessions also had been taken from him. In addition to this, heintroduced the ancient renown of the Macedonian kings, and the wholeworld pervaded by the victorious marches of that nation. ""The planwhich he proposed,"" he said, ""was free from any danger, either in thecommencement or in the issue. For he did not advise that Philip shouldstir until Antiochus should have come into Greece with an army; and,considering that, without the aid of Antiochus, he had maintained awar so long against the combined forces of the Romans and Aetolians,with what possible force could the Romans withstand him, when joinedby Antiochus, and supported by the aid of the Aetolians, who, on theformer occasion, were more dangerous enemies than the Romans?"" Headded the circumstance of Hannibal being general; ""a man born a foeto the Romans, who had slain greater numbers, both of their commandersand soldiers, than were left surviving."" Such were the representationsof Nicander to Philip. Dicaearchus addressed other arguments toAntiochus. In the first place, he told him, that ""the spoils of Philipbelonged to the Romans, but the victory over him to the Aetolians;that none other than the Aetolians had afforded to the Romansadmittance into Greece, and that the same people supplied them withthe strength which enabled them to conquer."" He next set forth thenumerous forces, both horse and foot, which they were willing tofurnish to Antiochus, for the purpose of the war; what quarters theywould assign to his land armament, what harbours for his naval forces.He then asserted whatever falsehoods he pleased, respecting Philipand Nabis; that ""both were ready to recommence hostilities, and wouldgreedily lay hold on the first opportunity of recovering what theyhad lost in war."" Thus did the Aetolians labour, in every part of theworld, to stir up war against the Romans. The kings, however, eithertook no steps in it or took them too late."Book 35,Chapter 13,"Nabis immediately despatched emissaries through all the towns onthe coast, to sow dissensions among the inhabitants: some of the menin power he brought over to his party by presents; others, who morefirmly adhered to the alliance with Rome, he put to death. The chargeof protecting all the Lacedaemonians on the coast, had been committedby Titus Quinctius to the Achaeans; they therefore instantly sentambassadors to the tyrant, to remind him of his treaty with theRomans, and to warn him against violating a peace which he had soearnestly sued for. They also sent succours to Gythium which hehad already besieged, and ambassadors to Rome to make known thesetransactions. King Antiochus having, this winter, solemnized thenuptials of his daughter with Ptolemy king of Egypt, at Raphia, inPhoenicia, returned thence to Antioch, and came, towards the end ofthe season, through Cilicia, after passing Mount Taurus, to the cityof Ephesus. Early in the spring, he sent his son Antiochus thence intoSyria, to guard the remote frontiers of his dominions, lest duringhis absence, any commotion might arise behind him; and then he marchedhimself, with all his land forces, to attack the Pisidians, inhabitingthe country near Sida. At this time, Publius Sulpicius and PubliusVillius, the Roman ambassadors, who were sent to Antiochus, as abovementioned, having received orders to wait on Eumenes, first came toElaea, and thence went up to Pergamus, for the palace of Eumenes wasthere. Eumenes was very desirous of a war against Antiochus, for hethought that, if peace continued, a king so much superior in powerwould be a troublesome neighbour; but that, in case of hostilities, hewould prove no more a match for the Romans than Philip had been; andthat, either he would be entirely removed out of the way, or, shouldpeace be granted to him, after a defeat he (Eumenes) might reasonablyexpect, that a great deal of what should be taken from Antiochus wouldfall to his own share; so that, in future, he might be very well ableto defend himself against him, without any aid from the Romans; andeven if any misfortune were to happen, it would be better for him,in conjunction with the Romans, to undergo any turn of fortune, than,standing alone, either suffer himself to be ruled by Antiochus, or, onrefusal, be compelled to submission by force of arms. Therefore, withall his influence, and every argument which he could devise, he urgedthe Romans to a war."Book 35,Chapter 14,"Sulpicius, falling sick, staid at Pergamus. Villius, on hearingthat the king was carrying on war in Pisidia, went on to Ephesus, and,during a few days that he halted in that city, took pains to procurefrequent interviews with Hannibal, who happened to be there at thetime, in order to sound his intentions, if possible, and to removehis apprehensions of danger threatening him from the Romans. No otherbusiness, indeed, of any kind was brought forward at these meetings;yet they accidentally produced an important consequence, aseffectually as if it had been intentionally sought; the loweringHannibal in the esteem of the king, and rendering him more obnoxiousto suspicion in every matter. Claudius, following the history writtenin Greek by Acilius, says, that Publius Africanus was employed in thisembassy, and that it was he who conversed with Hannibal at Ephesus.He even relates one of their conversations, in which Scipio askedHannibal, ""whom he thought the greatest captain?"" and that heanswered, ""Alexander, king of Macedonia; because, with a small band,he defeated armies whose numbers were beyond reckoning; and because hehad overrun the remotest regions, the merely visiting of which was athing above human aspiration."" Scipio then asked, ""to whom he gave thesecond place?"" and he replied, ""To Pyrrhus; for he first taught themethod of encamping; and besides, no one ever showed more exquisitejudgment, in choosing his ground, and disposing his posts; while healso possessed the art of conciliating mankind to himself to such adegree, that the nations of Italy wished him, though a foreign prince,to hold the sovereignty among them, rather than the Roman people, whohad so long possessed the dominion of that part of the world."" On hisproceeding to ask, ""whom he esteemed the third?"" Hannibal replied,""Myself, beyond doubt."" On this Scipio laughed, and added, ""What wouldyou have said if you had conquered me?"" ""Then,"" replied the other, ""Iwould have placed Hannibal, not only before Alexander and Pyrrhus,but before all other commanders."" This answer, turned with Punicdexterity, and conveying an unexpected kind of flattery, was highlygrateful to Scipio, as it set him apart from the crowd of commanders,as one of incomparable eminence."Book 35,Chapter 15,"From Ephesus, Villius proceeded to Apamea, whither Antiochus, onhearing of the coming of the Roman delegates, came to meet him. Inthis congress, at Apamea, the debates were similar to those whichpassed at Rome, between Quinctius and the king's ambassadors. The newsarriving of the death of Antiochus, the king's son, who, as just nowmentioned, had been sent into Syria, broke off the conference. Therewas great mourning in the court, and excessive regret for this youngman; for he had given such indications of his character as affordedevident proof that, had a longer life been allotted him, he wouldhave displayed the talents of a great and just prince. The more hewas beloved and esteemed by all, the more was his death a subject ofsuspicion, namely, that his father, thinking that his heir trod tooclosely on the heels of his own old age, had him taken off by poison,by some eunuchs, who recommend themselves to kings by the perpetrationof such foul deeds. People mentioned also, as another motive for thatclandestine act of villany, that, as he had given Lysimachia to hisson Seleucus, he had no establishment of the like kind, which hecould give to Antiochus, for the purpose of banishing him also toa distance, under pretext of doing him honour. Nevertheless, anappearance of deep mourning was maintained in the court for severaldays; and the Roman ambassador, lest his presence at that inauspicioustime might be troublesome, retired to Pergamus. The king, dropping theprosecution of the war which he had begun, went back to Ephesus; andthere, keeping himself shut up in the palace, under colour of grief,held secret consultations with a person called Minio, who was hisprincipal favourite. Minio was utterly ignorant of the state of allforeign nations; and, accordingly, estimating the strength of the kingfrom his successes in Syria or Asia, he was confident that Antiochushad not only superiority from the merits of his cause, and that thedemands of the Romans were highly unreasonable; but also, that hewould prove the more powerful in war. As the king wished to avoidfurther debate with the envoys, either because he had found noadvantage to result from the former conference, or because he was toomuch discomposed by recent grief, Minio undertook to say whateverwas requisite for his interest, and persuaded him to invite for thatpurpose the ambassadors from Pergamus."Book 35,Chapter 16,"By this time Sulpicius had recovered his health; both himself andVillius, therefore, came to Ephesus. Minio apologized for the kingnot being present, and the business was entered upon. Then Minio, in astudied speech, said, ""I find, Romans, that you profess very speciousintentions, (the liberating of the Grecian states,) but your actionsdo not accord with your words. You lay down one rule for Antiochus,and follow another yourselves. For, how are the inhabitants of Smyrnaand Lampsacus better entitled to the character of Greeks, than theNeapolitans, Rhegians, and Tarentines, from whom you exact tribute,and ships, in pursuance of a treaty? Why do you send yearly toSyracuse, and other Grecian cities of Sicily, a praetor, vestedwith sovereign power, and attended by his rods and axes? You can,certainly, allege no other reason than this, that, having conqueredthem in war, you imposed these terms on them. Admit, then, on the partof Antiochus, the same reason with respect to Smyrna and Lampsacus,and the cities belonging to Ionia and Aeolia. Conquered by hisancestors, they were subjected to tribute and taxes, and he onlyreclaims an ancient right. I would have you answer him on these heads,if you mean a fair discussion, and do not merely seek a pretence forwar."" Sulpicius answered, ""Antiochus has acted with some modestyin choosing that, since no other arguments could be produced in hisfavour, any other person should utter these rather than himself. For,what similarity is there in the cases of those states which youhave brought into comparison? From the Rhegians, Neapolitans, andTarentines we require what they owe us by treaty, in virtue of a rightinvariably exercised, in one uniform course, since they first cameunder our power; a right always asserted, and never intermitted. Now,can you assert, that, as these states have, neither of themselves,nor through any other, ever refused conforming to the treaty, so theAsiatic states, since they once came under the power of Antiochus'sancestors, have been held in uninterrupted possession by your reigningkings; and that some of them have not been subject to the dominion ofPhilip, some to that of Ptolemy; and that others have not, for manyyears, maintained themselves in a state of independence, no onecalling it in question? For, if the circumstance of their having beenonce subject to a foreigner, when crushed under the severity of thetimes, conveys a right to enforce that subjection again after a lapseof so many generations, what can be said of our having deliveredGreece from Philip, but that nothing was accomplished by us; and thathis successors may reclaim Corinth, Chalcis, Demetrias, and the wholenation of Thessaly? But why do I plead the cause of those states,which it would be fitter that both we and the king should hear pleadedby themselves?"""Book 35,Chapter 17,"He then desired, that the deputies of those states should becalled, for they had been prepared beforehand, and kept in readinessby Eumenes, who reckoned, that every share of strength that shouldbe taken away from Antiochus, would become an accession to his ownkingdom. Many of them were introduced; and, while each enforcedhis own complaints, and sometimes demands, and blended together thereasonable with the unreasonable, they changed the debate into a merealtercation. The ambassadors, therefore, without conceding or carryingany one point, returned to Rome just as they had come, leaving everything in an undecided state. On their departure the king held acouncil, on the subject of a war with Rome, in which each spoke moreviolently than his predecessor; for every one thought, that the morebitterly he inveighed against the Romans, the greater share of favourhe might expect to obtain. One animadverted upon the insolence oftheir demands, in which they presume to impose terms on Antiochus,the greatest king in Asia, as they would on the vanquished Nabis.""Although to Nabis they left absolute power over his own country,and its capital, Lacedaemon, yet it seems to them a matter forindignation, that Smyrna and Lampsacus should yield obedience toAntiochus.""--Others said, that ""to so great a monarch, those citieswere but a trivial ground of war, scarcely worth mention; but, thatthe beginning of unjust impositions was always made in the case ofmatters of little consequence; unless, indeed, it could be supposed,that the Persians, when they demanded earth and water from theLacedaemonians, stood in need of a scrap of the land or a draught ofthe water. The proceedings of the Romans, respecting the two cities,were meant as a trial of the same sort. The rest of the states, whenthey saw that two had shaken off the yoke, would go over to the partyof that nation which professed the patronage of liberty. If freedomwas not actually preferable to servitude, yet the hope of betteringtheir circumstances by a change, was more flattering to every one thanany present situation."""Book 35,Chapter 18,"There was, in the council, an Acarnanian named Alexander, who hadformerly been a friend of Philip, but had lately left him, to followthe more opulent court of Antiochus. And as being well skilled inthe affairs of Greece, and not unacquainted with the Romans, he wasadmitted by the king into such a degree of intimacy, that he sharedeven in his secret councils. As if the question to be considered werenot, whether there should be war or not, but where and in what mannerit should be carried on, he affirmed, that ""he saw an assured prospectof victory, provided the king would pass into Europe and choose somepart of Greece for the seat of war. In the first place, the Aetolians,who lived in the centre of Greece, would be found in arms, readyto take the lead in the most perilous operations. Then, in the twoextremities of Greece, Nabis, on the side of Peloponnesus, would putevery thing in motion, to recover the city of Argos, and the maritimecities, from which he had been expelled by the Romans, and pent upwithin the walls of Lacedaemon: while, on the side of Macedonia,Philip would be ready for the field the moment he heard the alarmsounded. He knew,"" he said, ""his spirit, he knew his temper; he knewthat, (as in the case with wild beasts, confined by bars or chains,)for a long time past, he had been revolving the fiercest resentmentsin his breast. He remembered, also, how often, during the war,that prince had prayed to all the gods to grant him Antiochus as anassistant; and, if that prayer were now heard with favour, he wouldnot hesitate an instant to resume his arms. It was only requisite thatthere should be no delay, no procrastination; for success dependedchiefly on securing beforehand commodious posts and proper allies:besides, Hannibal ought to be sent immediately into Africa, in orderto distract the attention of the Romans."""Book 35,Chapter 19,"Hannibal was not called to this consultation, having incomesuspected by the king, and not having subsequently been held in anyhonour, on account of his conferences with Villius, and he had notsince shown him any mark of regard. This affront, at first, he borein silence; but afterwards thought it better to take some properopportunity to inquire the reason of the king's suddenly withdrawinghis favour, and to clear himself of blame. Without any preface, heasked the cause of the king's displeasure; and having heard it, said,""Antiochus, when I was yet an infant, my father, Hamilcar, at a timewhen he was offering sacrifice, brought me up to the altars, and mademe take an oath, that I never would be a friend to the Roman people.Under the obligation of this oath, I carried arms against them forthirty-six years; this oath, on peace being made, drove me out of mycountry, and brought me an exile to your court; and this oath shallguide me, should you disappoint my hopes, until I traverse everyquarter of the globe, where I can understand that there are resources,to find out enemies to the Romans. If, therefore, your courtiers haveconceived the idea of ingratiating themselves with you by insinuatingsuspicions of me, let them seek some means of advancing theirreputation otherwise than at my expense. I hate, and am hated by, theRomans. That I speak the truth in this, my father, Hamilcar, andthe gods are witnesses. Whenever, therefore, you shall employ yourthoughts on a plan of waging war with Rome, consider Hannibal as oneof your firmest friends. If circumstances force you to adopt peacefulmeasures, on such a subject employ some one else with whom todeliberate."" This discourse not only affected the king much, but evenreconciled him to Hannibal. They departed from the council with theresolution that the war should be undertaken."Book 35,Chapter 20,"At Rome, people in their conversations anticipated, indeed,Antiochus as an enemy, but they had hitherto prepared nothing for sucha war but their expectations. Italy was decreed the province of boththe consuls, who received directions to settle between themselves, ordraw lots, which of them should preside at the elections of theyear; and it was ordered, that he who should be disengaged from thatbusiness, should hold himself in readiness, in case there should beoccasion, to lead the legions any where out of that country. To thesaid consul, permission was given to levy two new legions, and twentythousand foot, and nine hundred horse, among the allies and Latinconfederates. To the other consul were decreed the two legions whichhad been commanded by Lucius Cornelius, consul of the preceding year;and from the same army, a body of allies and Latins, amounting tofifteen thousand foot and five hundred horse. Quintus Minucius wascontinued in command, with the forces which he then had in Liguria; asa supplement to which, four thousand Roman foot and five hundred horsewere ordered to be enlisted, and five thousand foot and two hundredand fifty horse to be demanded from the allies. The duty of departingfrom Italy, whithersoever the senate should order, fell to CneiusDomitius; Gaul, and the holding the elections, to Lucius Quinctius.The praetors then cast lots for their provinces: to Marcus FulviusCentumalus fell the city jurisdiction; to Lucius Scribonius Libo,the foreign; Lucius Valerius Tappus obtained Sicily; Quintus SaloniusSarra, Sardinia; Marcus Baebius Tamphilus, Hither Spain; and MarcusAtilius Serranus, Farther Spain. But the provinces of the two lastwere changed, first by a decree of the senate, which was afterwardsconfirmed by an order of the people. The fleet and Macedonia wereassigned to Atilius; Bruttium to Baebius. Flaminius and Fulvius werecontinued in command in both the Hither and Farther Spain. To BaebiusTamphilus, for the business of Bruttium, were decreed the two legionswhich had served in the city the year before; and he was ordered todemand from the allies, for the same service, fifteen thousand footand five hundred horse. Atilius was ordered to build thirty ships offive banks of oars: to bring out, from the docks, any old ones thatwere fit for service, and to raise seamen. An order was also given tothe consul, to supply him with two thousand of the allied and Latinfootmen, and a thousand Roman. The destination of these two praetors,and their two armaments, one on land and the other on sea, wasdeclared to be intended against Nabis, who was now carrying on openhostilities against the allies of the Roman people. But it was thoughtproper to wait the return of the ambassadors sent to Antiochus, andthe senate ordered the consul Cneius Domitius not to leave the cityuntil they arrived."Book 35,Chapter 21,"The praetors, Fulvius and Scribonius, whose province was theadministration of justice at Rome, were charged to provide a hundredquinqueremes, besides the fleet which Atilius was to command. Beforethe consul and praetors set out for their provinces, a supplicationwas performed on account of some prodigies. A report was brought fromPicenum, that a goat had produced six kids at a birth. It was saidthat a boy was born at Arretium who had but one hand; that, atAmiternum, a shower of earth fell; a gate and wall at Formiae werestruck by lightning; and, what was more alarming than all, an ox,belonging to the consul, Cneius Domitius, spoke these words,--""Rome,take care of thyself."" To expiate the other prodigies, a supplicationwas performed; the ox was ordered by the aruspices to be carefullypreserved and fed. The Tiber, pouring into the city with moredestructive violence than last year, swept away two bridges, andmany buildings, particularly about the Flumentan gate. A huge rock,loosened from its seat, either by the rains, or by an earthquake soslight that no other effect of it was perceived, tumbled down from theCapitol into the Jugarian street, and buried many people under it.In the country, many parts of which were overflowed, much cattlewas carried away, and a great destruction of farm houses took place.Previous to the arrival of the consul, Lucius Quinctius, in hisprovince Quintus Minucius fought a pitched battle with the Ligurians,in the territory of Pisae, slew nine thousand of the enemy, andputting the rest to flight, drove them within their works, which wereassaulted and defended in an obstinate contest until night came on.During the night, the Ligurians stole away unobserved; and, at thefirst dawn, the Romans took possession of their deserted camp, wherethe quantity of booty found was the less, because the enemy frequentlysent home the spoil taken in the country. Minucius, after this,allowed them no respite. From the territory of Pisae he marched intothat of the Ligurians, and, with fire and sword, utterly destroyedtheir forts and towns, where the Roman soldiers were abundantlyenriched with the spoils of Etruria which the ravagers had sent home."Book 35,Chapter 22,"About this time, the ambassadors, who had been sent to the kings,returned to Rome. As they brought no information of such a natureas called for any immediate declaration of war, (except against theLacedaemonian tyrant, whom the Achaean ambassadors also represented asinvading the sea-coast of Laconia, in breach of treaty,) Atilius, thepraetor, was sent with the fleet to Greece, for the protection of theallies. It was resolved, that, as there was nothing to be apprehendedfrom Antiochus at present, both the consuls should go to theirprovinces; and, accordingly, Domitius marched into the country of theBoians, by the shorter road, through Ariminum, and Quinctius throughLiguria. The two armies of the consuls, proceeding by these differentroutes, spread devastation wide over the enemy's country. Inconsequence of which, first a few of their horsemen, with theircommanders, then their whole senate, and at last all who possessedeither property or dignity, to the number of one thousand fivehundred, came over and joined the consuls. In both Spains, likewise,success attended the Roman arms during this year. For, in one, CaiusFlaminius, after a siege, took Litabrum, a strong and opulent city,and made prisoner Corribilo, a powerful chieftain; and, in the other,Marcus Fulvius, the proconsul, fought two successful battles, withtwo armies of the enemy. He captured Vescelia and Holo, two townsbelonging to the Spaniards, with many of their forts, and othersspontaneously revolted to him. Then, advancing into the territory ofOretum, and having, there also, taken two cities, Noliba and Cusibis,he proceeded to the river Tagus. Here stood Toletum, a small city,but strong from its situation. While he was besieging this place,a numerous army of Vectonians came to relieve the Toletans, buthe overthrew them in a general engagement, and having defeated theVectonians, took Toletum by means of his works."Book 35,Chapter 23,"At this juncture the wars in which they were actually engaged,caused not so great anxiety in the minds of the senate, as theexpectation of one with Antiochus, which had not yet commenced. Foralthough, through their ambassadors, they had, from time to time,made careful inquiries into every particular, yet rumours, rashlypropagated without authentic foundation, intermixed many falsehoodswith the truth. Among the rest, a report was spread, that Antiochusintended, as soon as he should come into Aetolia, to send a fleetimmediately into Sicily. The senate, therefore, though they hadalready despatched the praetor, Atilius, with a squadron to Greece,yet, considering that not only a military force, but also theinfluence of reputation, would be necessary towards securing theattachment of the allies, they sent into Greece, in quality ofambassadors, Titus Quinctius, Caius Octavius, Cneius Servilius, andPublius Villius; at the same time ordering, in their decree, thatMarcus Baebius should lead forward his legions from Bruttium toTarentum and Brundusium, so that, if occasion required, he mighttransport them thence into Macedonia. They also ordered, that MarcusFulvius, the praetor, should send a fleet of thirty ships to protectthe coast of Sicily; and that, whoever had the direction of thatfleet, should be invested with supreme authority. To this commissionwas appointed Lucius Oppius Salinator, who had been plebeian aedilethe year before. They likewise determined, that the same praetorshould write to his colleague, Lucius Valerius, that ""there was reasonto apprehend that the ships of king Antiochus would pass over fromAetolia to Sicily; for which reason the senate judged it proper, that,in addition to the army which he then had, he should enlist tumultuarysoldiers, to the number of twelve thousand foot and four hundredhorse, with which he might be able to defend that coast of hisprovince which lay next to Greece."" This enlistment the praetorcarried on, not only from Sicily, but from the circumjacent islands;and strengthened all the towns on the coast which lay opposite toGreece with garrisons. To the rumours already current, the arrival ofAttalus, the brother of Eumenes, added confirmation, for he broughtintelligence that king Antiochus had crossed the Hellespont withhis army, and that the Aetolians were putting themselves into such aposture, that by the time of his arrival they would be in arms.Thanks were given to Eumenes, in his absence, and to Attalus, whowas present; and there were decreed to him free lodgings and everyaccommodation; that he should be presented with two horses, two suitsof horsemen's armour, vases of silver to a hundred pounds' weight, andof gold to twenty pounds."Book 35,Chapter 24,"As one messenger after another brought intelligence that the warwas on the point of breaking out, it was judged expedient that consulsshould be elected as soon as possible. Wherefore the senate passed adecree, that the praetor, Marcus Fulvius, should instantly despatcha letter to the consul, informing him, that it was the will of thesenate that he should leave the command of the province and army tohis lieutenant-generals, and return to Rome; and that, when on theroad, he should send on before him an edict appointing the assembliesfor the election of consuls. The consul complied with the letter; andhaving sent forward the edict, arrived at Rome. There was, thisyear also, a warm competition, three patricians suing for oneplace: Publius Cornelius Scipio, son to Cneius, who had suffered adisappointment the year before, Lucius Cornelius Scipio, and CneiusManlius Vulso. The consulship was conferred on Publius Scipio, that itmight appear that the honour had only been delayed, and not refused toa person of such character. The plebeian colleague, joined with him,was Manius Acilius Glabrio. Next day were created praetors, LuciusAemilius Paulus, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Marcus Junius Brutus, AulusCornelius Mammula, Caius Livius, and Lucius Oppius; the two last,both of them, surnamed Salinator. This was the same Oppius whohad conducted the fleet of thirty ships to Sicily. While the newmagistrates were settling the distribution of their provinces, orderswere despatched to Marcus Baebius to pass over, with all his forces,from Brundusium to Epirus, and to keep the army stationed nearApollonia; and Marcus Fulvius, city praetor, was commissioned to buildfifty new quinqueremes."Book 35,Chapter 25,"Such were the precautions taken by the Roman people to guardagainst every attempt of Antiochus. At this time, Nabis did notprocrastinate hostilities, but, with his utmost force, carried on thesiege of Gythium; and, being incensed against the Achaeans, for havingsent succours to the besieged, he ravaged their lands. The Achaeanswould not venture to engage in war, until their ambassadors shouldcome back from Rome, and acquaint them with the sentiments of thesenate: but as soon as these returned, they summoned a council atSicyon, and also sent deputies to Titus Quinctius to ask his advice.In the council, all the members were inclined to vote for an immediatedeclaration of war; but a letter from Titus Quinctius, in which herecommended waiting for the Roman praetor and fleet, caused somehesitation. While some of the principal members persisted in theirfirst opinion, and others argued that they ought to follow the counselof the person to whom they of themselves had applied for advice,the generality waited to hear the sentiments of Philopoemen. He waspraetor of Achaia at the time, and surpassed all his contemporariesboth in wisdom and influence. He first observed, that ""it was a wiserule, established among the Achaeans, that their praetor, when heproposed a question concerning war, should not himself declare anopinion:"" and then he desired them to ""fix their determination amongthemselves as soon as possible;"" assuring them, that ""their praetorwould faithfully and carefully carry their decrees into execution;and would use his best endeavours, that, as far as depended on humanprudence, they should not repent either of peace or war."" These wordshad more influence in inciting them to war, than if, by openly arguingin favour of it, he had betrayed an eager desire for the managementof it. War was therefore unanimously resolved on: the time and modeof conducting it were left to the praetor without restriction.Philopoemen's own judgment, indeed, besides it being the opinion ofQuinctius, pointed it out as best to wait for the Roman fleet, whichmight succour Gythium by sea; but fearing that the business would notendure delay, and that not only Gythium, but the party which had beensent to protect the city, would fall into the hands of the enemy, hedrew out the ships of the Achaeans."Book 35,Chapter 26,"The tyrant also, with the view of cutting off any supplies thatmight be brought to the besieged by sea, had fitted out a smallsquadron, consisting of only three ships of war, with some barksand cutters, as his former fleet had been given up to the Romans,according to the treaty. In order to try the activity of thesevessels, as they were then new, and, at the same time, to have everything in fit condition for a battle, he put out to sea every day, andexercised both the rowers and marines in mock-fights; for he thoughtthat all his hopes of succeeding in the siege depended on thecircumstance of his cutting off all supplies by sea. The praetor ofthe Achaeans, in respect of skill for conducting operations on land,was equal to any of the most celebrated commanders both in capacityand experience, yet with naval affairs he was quite unacquainted.Being an inhabitant of Arcadia, an inland country, he was ignoranteven of all foreign affairs, excepting that he had once served inCrete as commander of a body of auxiliaries. There was an old ship offour banks of oars, which had been taken eighty years before, as itwas conveying Nicaea, the wife of Craterus, from Naupactum to Corinth.Led by the reputation of this ship, for it had formerly been reckoneda very famous vessel when in the king's fleet, he ordered it, thoughnow quite rotten, and falling asunder through age, to be brought outfrom Aegium. The fleet sailed with this ship at its head, Tiso ofPatrae, the commander, being on board it, when the ships of theLacedaemonians from Gythium came within view. At the first shock,against a new and firm vessel, that old one, which before admitted thewater through every joint, was shattered to pieces, and the whole crewwere made prisoners. On the loss of the commander's ship, the rest ofthe fleet fled as fast as each could by means of its oars. Philopoemenhimself made his escape in a light advice-boat, nor did he stop hisflight until he arrived at Patrae. This untoward event did not in theleast damp the spirit of a man so well versed in military affairs, andwho had experienced so many vicissitudes of fortune. On the contrary,as he had failed of success in the naval line, in which he had noexperience, he even conceived, thence, the greater hopes of succeedingin another, wherein he had acquired knowledge; and he affirmed, thathe would quickly put an end to the tyrant's rejoicing."Book 35,Chapter 27,"Nabis, being both elated by this adventure, and entertaining aconfident hope that he had not now any danger to apprehend from thesea, resolved to shut up the passages on the land also, by partiesstationed in proper posts. With this view, he drew off a third part ofhis forces from the siege of Gythium, and encamped them at Pleiae, aplace which commands both Leucae and Acriae, on the road by which theenemy's army seemed likely to advance. While his quarters were here,and very few of his men had tents, (the generality of them havingformed huts of reeds interwoven, and which they covered with leavesof trees, to serve merely as a shelter,) Philopoemen, before he camewithin sight, resolved to surprise him by an attack of such a kindas he did not expect. He drew together some small ships in a remotecreek, on the coast of the territory of Argos, and embarked on boardthem a body of light-armed soldiers, mostly targeteers, furnished withslings, javelins, and other light kinds of weapons. He then coastedalong the shore, until he came to a promontory near Nabis's post. Herehe landed; and made his way, by night, through paths with which he waswell acquainted, to Pleiae, and while the sentinels were fast asleep,as being in no immediate apprehension, he set fire to the huts inevery part of the camp. Great numbers perished in the flames beforethey could discover the enemy's arrival, and those who did discoverit could give no assistance; so that nearly the whole was destroyed byfire and sword. From both these means of destruction, however, a verysmall number made their escape, and fled to the principal camp beforeGythium. The enemy having been thus smitten with disaster, Philopoemenforthwith led on his forces to ravage the district of Tripolis, a partof the Lacedaemonian territory, lying next to the frontiers of theMegalopolitans, and carrying off thence a vast number of men andcattle, withdrew before the tyrant could send a force from Gythium toprotect the country. He then collected his whole force at Tegea, towhich place he summoned a council of the Achaeans and their allies;at which were present, also deputies from the Epirots and Acarnanians.Here it was resolved, that as the minds of his men were nowsufficiently recovered from the shame of the disgrace suffered atsea, and those of the enemy dispirited, he should march directly toLacedaemon; for he considered that by this measure alone could theenemy be drawn off from the siege of Gythium. On entering the enemy'scountry, he encamped the first day at Caryae; and, on that very day,Gythium was taken. Ignorant of that event, Philopoemen advanced to theBarbosthenes, a mountain ten miles from Lacedaemon. On the other side,Nabis, after taking possession of Gythium, set out, at the head of abody of light troops, marched hastily by Lacedaemon, and seized on aplace called the Camp of Pyrrhus, which post he did not doubt thatthe Achaeans intended to occupy. From thence he proceeded to meet theenemy. From the length of their train in consequence of the narrownessof the road, they spread over a space of almost five miles. The linewas closed by the cavalry and the greatest part of the auxiliaries,because Philopoemen expected that the tyrant would attack him inthe rear with his mercenary troops, in whom he placed his principalconfidence. Two unforeseen circumstances at once filled him withuneasiness: one, the post at which he aimed being pre-occupied; theother, the enemy having met him in front, where, as the road laythrough very uneven ground, he did not see how the battalions couldadvance without the support of the light troops."Book 35,Chapter 28,"Philopoemen was possessed of an admirable degree of skill andexperience, in conducting a march, and choosing his station; havingmade these points his principal study, not only in times of war, butlikewise during peace. Whenever he was making a journey to any placeand came to a defile where the passage was difficult, it was hispractice, first, to examine the nature of the ground on every side.When journeying alone, he meditated within himself; if he had company,he asked them, ""If an enemy should appear in that place, what courseought he to adopt, if they should attack him in front; what, if onthis flank, or on that; what, if on the rear; for he might happen tomeet them while his men were formed with a regular front, or when theywere in the loose order of march, fit only for the road."" He wouldproceed to examine, either in his own mind, or by asking questions,""What ground he himself would choose; what number of soldiers, or whatkind of arms (which was a very material point) he ought to employ;where he should deposit the baggage, where the soldiers' necessaries,where the unarmed multitude; with what number and what kind of troopshe should guard them, and whether it would be better to prosecute hismarch as intended, or to return back by the way he came; what spot,also, he should choose for his camp; how large a space he shouldenclose within the lines; where he could be conveniently suppliedwith water; where a sufficiency of forage and wood could be had; whichwould be his safest road on decamping next day, and in what form thearmy should march?"" In such studies and inquiries he had, from hisearly years, so frequently exercised his thoughts, that, on any thingof the kind occurring, no expedient that could be devised was new tohim. On this occasion, he first ordered the army to halt; then sentforward to the van the auxiliary Cretans, and the horsemen calledTarentines, each leading two spare horses; and, ordering the rest ofthe cavalry to follow, he seized on a rock which stood over a rivulet,from which he might be supplied with water. Here he collected togetherall the baggage with all the suttlers and followers of the army,placing a guard of soldiers round them; and then he fortified hiscamp, as the nature of the place required. The pitching of tents insuch rugged and uneven ground was a difficult task. The enemy weredistant not more than five hundred paces. Both drew water from thesame rivulet, under escorts of light troops; but, before any skirmishtook place, as usual between men encamped so near to each other, nightcame on. It was evident, however, that they must, unavoidably,fight next day at the rivulet, in support of the watering parties.Wherefore, during the night, Philopoemen concealed, in a valley remotefrom the view of the enemy, as great a number of targeteers as theplace was capable of hiding."Book 35,Chapter 29,"At break of day, the Cretan light infantry and the Tarentine horsebegan an engagement on the bank of the rivulet. Telemnastus, a Cretan,commanded his countrymen; Lycortas of Megalopolis, the cavalry. Theenemies' watering party also was guarded by Cretan auxiliaries andTarentine horsemen. The fight was, for a considerable time, doubtful,as the troops on both sides were of the same kind and armed alike; butas the contest advanced, the tyrant's auxiliaries gained an advantage,both by their superiority of numbers, and because Philopoemen hadgiven directions to his officers, that, after maintaining the contestfor a short time they should betake themselves to flight, and drawthe enemy on to the place of the ambuscade. The latter, pursuing therunaways, in disorderly haste, through the valley, were most of themwounded and slain, before they discovered their concealed foe. Thetargeteers had posted themselves in such order, as far as the breadthof the valley allowed, that they easily gave a passage to their flyingfriends, through openings in their ranks; then starting up themselves,hale, fresh, and in regular order, they briskly attacked the enemy,whose ranks were broken, who were scattered in confusion, and were,besides, exhausted with fatigue and wounds. The victory was no longerdoubtful; the tyrant's troops instantly turned their backs, and flyingwith much more precipitation than they had pursued, were driven intotheir camp. Great numbers were killed and taken in the pursuit; andthe consternation would have spread through the camp also, had notPhilopoemen ordered a retreat to be sounded; for he dreaded the ground(which was rough and dangerous to advance on without caution) morethan he did the enemy. Judging, both from the issue of the battle andfrom the disposition of the enemy's leader, in what apprehensionhe then was, he sent to him one of the auxiliary soldiers in thecharacter of a deserter, to assure him positively, that the Achaeanshad resolved to advance, next day, to the river Eurotas, which runsalmost close to the walls, in order to intercept his way, so that thetyrant could have no retreat to the city when he required it, and toprevent any provisions being brought thence to the camp; and that theyintended, at the same time, to try whether any could be prevailed onto desert his cause. Although the deserter did not gain entire credit,yet he afforded to one, who was full of apprehensions, a plausiblepretext for leaving his camp. On the day following, he orderedPythagoras, with the auxiliaries and cavalry, to mount guard beforethe rampart; and then, marching out himself with the main body of thearmy, as if intending to offer battle, he ordered them to return withall haste to the city."Book 35,Chapter 30,"When Philopoemen saw their army marching precipitately througha narrow and steep road, he sent all his cavalry, together with theCretan auxiliaries, against the guard of the enemy, stationed in thefront of their camp. These, seeing their adversaries approach, andperceiving that their friends had abandoned them, at first attemptedto retreat within their works; but afterwards, when the whole force ofthe Achaeans advanced in order of battle, they were seized withfear, lest, together with the camp itself, they might be taken; theyresolved, therefore, to follow the body of their army, which, bythis time, had proceeded to a considerable distance in advance.Immediately, the targeteers of the Achaeans assailed and plundered thecamp, and the rest set out in pursuit of the enemy. The road was such,that a body of men, even when undisturbed by any fear of a foe, couldnot, without difficulty, make its way through it. But when an attackwas made on their rear, and the shouts of terror, raised by theaffrighted troops behind, reached to the van, they threw down theirarms, and fled, each for himself, in different directions, into thewoods which lay on each side of the road. In an instant of time, theway was stopped up with heaps of weapons, particularly spears, which,falling mostly with their points towards the pursuers, formed a kindof palisade across the road. Philopoemen ordered the auxiliaries topush forward, whenever they could, in pursuit of the enemy, who wouldfind it a difficult matter, the horsemen particularly, to continuetheir flight; while he himself led away the heavy troops through moreopen ground to the river Eurotas. There he pitched his camp a littlebefore sun-set, and waited for the light troops which he had sentin chase of the enemy. These arrived at the first watch, and broughtintelligence, that Nabis, with a few attendants, had made his way intothe city, and that the rest of his army, unarmed and dispersed, werestraggling through all parts of the woods; whereupon, he ordered themto refresh themselves, while he himself chose out a party of men, who,having come earlier into camp, were by this time, both recruited byfood and a little rest; and, ordering them to carry nothing with thembut their swords, he marched them out directly, and posted them in theroads which led from two of the gates, one towards Pherae, the othertowards the Barbosthenes: for he supposed, that through these theflying enemy would make their retreat. Nor was he mistaken in thatopinion; for the Lacedaemonians, as long as any light remained,retreated through the centre of the woods in the most retired paths.As soon as it grew dusk, and they saw lights in the enemy's camp, theykept themselves in paths concealed from view; but having passed itby, they then thought that all was safe, and came down into the openroads, where they were intercepted by the parties lying in wait; andthere such numbers of them were killed and taken, that of the wholearmy scarcely a fourth part effected their escape. As the tyrant wasnow pent up within the city, Philopoemen employed the greatest partof thirty succeeding days in ravaging the lands of the Lacedaemonians;and then, after greatly reducing, and almost annihilating the strengthof the tyrant, he returned home, while the Achaeans extolled him asequal in the glory of his services to the Roman general, and indeed,so far as regarded the war with Lacedaemon, even deemed him superior."Book 35,Chapter 31,"While the Achaeans and the tyrant were carrying on the war in thismanner, the Roman ambassadors made a circuit through the cities of theallies; being anxious lest the Aetolians might seduce some of themto join the party of Antiochus. They took but little pains, in theirapplications to the Achaeans; because, knowing their animosity againstNabis, they thought that they might be safely relied on with regard toother matters. They went first to Athens, thence to Chalcis, thence toThessaly; and, after addressing the Thessalians, in a full assembly,they directed their route to Demetrias, to which place a council ofthe Magnetians was summoned. There a more studied address required tobe delivered; for a great many of the leading men were disaffected tothe Romans, and entirely devoted to the interests of Antiochus andthe Aetolians; because, at the time when accounts were received thatPhilip's son, who was a hostage, would be restored to him, and thetribute imposed on him remitted, among other groundless reports it hadbeen given out, that the Romans also intended to restore Demetrias tohim. Rather than that should take place, Eurylochus, a deputy of theMagnetians, and others of that faction, wished for a total change ofmeasures to be effected by the coming of Antiochus and the Aetolians.In opposition to those, it was necessary to reason in such a manner,that, in dispelling their mistaken fear, the ambassadors should not,by cutting off his hopes at once, give any disgust to Philip, to whommore importance attached, in all respects, than to the Magnetians.They only observed to the assembly, that, ""as Greece in general wasunder an obligation to the Romans for their kindness in restoring itsliberty, so was their state in particular. For there had not onlybeen a garrison of Macedonians in their capital, but a palace had beenbuilt in it, that they might have a master continually before theireyes. But all that had been done would be of no effect, if theAetolians should bring thither Antiochus, and settle him in the abodeof Philip, so that a new and unknown king should be set over them,in the place of an old one, with whom they had been long acquainted.""Their chief magistrate is styled Magnetarch. This office was then heldby Eurylochus, who assuming confidence from this powerful station,openly declared that he and the Magnetians saw no reason to dissembletheir having heard the common report about the restoration ofDemetrias to Philip; to prevent which, the Magnetians were bound toattempt and to hazard every thing; and, in the eagerness of discourse,he was carried to such an inconsiderate length, as to throw out, that,""at that very time Demetrias was only free in appearance; and that, inreality, all things were at the nod of the Romans."" Immediately afterthis expression there was a general murmur of dissent in the assembly;some of whom showed their approbation, others expressed indignation athis presumption, in uttering it. As to Quinctius, he was so inflamedwith anger, that, raising his hands towards heaven, he invoked thegods to witness the ungrateful and perfidious disposition of theMagnetians. This struck terror into the whole assembly; and one of thedeputies, named Zeno, who had acquired a great degree of influence, byhis judicious course of conduct in life, and by having been always anavowed supporter of the interests of the Romans, with tears besoughtQuinctius, and the other ambassadors, ""not to impute to the state themadness of an individual. Every man,"" he said, ""was answerable forhis own absurdities. As to the Magnetians, they were indebted to TitusQuinctius and the Roman people, not only for liberty, but for everything that mankind hold valuable or sacred. By their kindness, theywere in the enjoyment of every blessing, for which they could everpetition the immortal gods; and, if struck with phrensy they wouldsooner vent their fury on their own persons, than violate thefriendship with Rome."""Book 35,Chapter 32,"His entreaties were seconded by the prayers of the whole assembly;on which Eurylochus retired hastily from the council, and passing tothe gate through private streets fled away into Aetolia. As to theAetolians, they now gave plainer indications of their intention torevolt every day; and it happened, that at this very time Thoas, oneof their leading men, whom they had sent to Antiochus, returned, andbrought back with him an ambassador from the king, named Menippus.These two, before the council met to give them audience, filled everyone's ears with pompous accounts of the naval and land forces thatwere coming; ""a vast army,"" they said, ""of horse and foot was onits march from India; and, besides, that they were bringing such aquantity of gold and silver, as was sufficient to purchase the Romansthemselves;"" which latter circumstance they knew would influencethe multitude more than any thing else. It was easy to foresee whateffects these reports would produce in the council; for the Romanambassadors received information of the arrival of those men, and ofall their proceedings. And although the matter had almost come to arupture, yet Quinctius thought it advisable, that some ambassadorsof the allies should be present in that council, who might remind theAetolians of their alliance with Rome, and who might have the courageto speak with freedom in opposition to the king's ambassador. TheAthenians seemed to be the best qualified for this purpose, byreason of the high reputation of their state, and also from theirlong-standing alliance with the Aetolians. Quinctius, therefore,requested of them to send ambassadors to the Panaetolic council. Atthe first meeting, Thoas made a report of the business of his embassy.After him, Menippus was introduced, who said, that ""it would havebeen best for all the Greeks, residing both in Greece and Asia, ifAntiochus could have taken a part in their affairs, while the powerof Philip was yet unbroken; for then every one would have had whatof right belonged to him, and the whole would not have come underthe dominion and absolute disposal of the Romans. But even as mattersstand at present,"" said he, ""provided you have constancy enough tocarry into effect the measures which you have adopted, Antiochuswill be able, with the assistance of the gods and the alliance of theAetolians, to reinstate the affairs of Greece in their former rankof dignity, notwithstanding the low condition to which they have beenreduced. But this dignity consists in a state of freedom which standsby its own resources, and is not dependent on the will of another.""The Athenians, who were permitted to deliver their sentiments nextafter the king's ambassadors, omitting all mention of Antiochus,reminded the Aetolians of their alliance with Rome, and the benefitsconferred by Titus Quinctius on the whole body of Greece; andadmonished them, ""not inconsiderately to break off that connexionby the undue precipitation of their counsels; that passionate andadventurous schemes, however flattering at first view, prove difficultin the execution, and disastrous in the issue; that as the Romanambassadors, and among them Titus Quinctius, were within a smalldistance, it would be better, while all hostilities were as yetuncommenced, to discuss, in conference, any matters in dispute, thanto rouse Europe and Asia to a dreadful war."""Book 35,Chapter 33,"The multitude, ever fond of novelty, warmly espoused the cause ofAntiochus, and gave their opinion, that the Romans should not even beadmitted into the council; but, by the influence chiefly of the eldermembers, a vote was passed, that the council should give audienceto the Romans. On being acquainted, by the Athenians, with thisdetermination, Quinctius thought it desirable to go into Aetolia; forhe thought that, ""either he should be able to effect some change intheir designs; or that it would be manifest to all mankind, that theblame of the war would lie on the Aetolians, and that the Romanswould be warranted in taking arms by justice, and, in a manner, bynecessity."" On arriving there, Quinctius, in his discourse to thecouncil, began with the first formation of the alliance between theRomans and the Aetolians, and enumerated how many times the faith ofthe treaty had been violated by them. He then enlarged a little onthe rights of the states concerned in the dispute, and added, that,""notwithstanding, if they thought that they had any reasonable demandto make, it would surely be infinitely better to send ambassadors toRome, whether they chose to argue the case or to make a request tothe senate, than that the Roman people should enter the lists withAntiochus, while the Aetolians acted as marshals of the field; notwithout great disturbance to the affairs of the world, and tothe utter ruin of Greece."" That ""no people would feel the fatalconsequences of such a war sooner than the first promoters of it.""This prediction of the Roman was disregarded. Thoas, and others ofthe same faction, were then heard with general approbation; and theyprevailed so far, that, without adjourning the meeting, or waiting forthe absence of the Romans, a decree was passed that Antiochus shouldbe invited to vindicate the liberty of Greece, and decide the disputebetween the Aetolians and the Romans. To the insolence of this decree,their praetor, Damocritus, added a personal affront: for on Quinctiusasking him for a copy of the decree, without any respect to thedignity of the person to whom he spoke, he told him, that ""he had, atpresent, more pressing business to despatch; but he would shortly givehim the decree, and an answer, in Italy, from his camp on the banksof the Tiber."" Such was the degree of madness which possessed, at thattime, both the nation of the Aetolians and their magistrates."Book 35,Chapter 34,"Quinctius and the ambassadors returned to Corinth. The Aetolians,that they might appear to intend taking every step through Antiochus,and none directly of themselves, and, sitting inactive, to be waitingfor the arrival of the king, though they did not, after the departureof the Romans, hold a council of the whole nation, yet endeavoured,by their Apocleti, (a more confidential council, composed of personsselected from the rest,) to devise schemes for setting Greece incommotion. It was well known to them all, that in the several statesthe principal people, particularly those of the best characters, weredisposed to maintain the Roman alliance, and well pleased with thepresent state of affairs; but that the populace, and especiallysuch as were not content with their position, wished for a generalrevolution. The Aetolians, at one day's sitting, formed a scheme,the very conception of which argued not only boldness, butimpudence,--that of making themselves masters of Demetrias, Chalcis,and Lacedaemon. One of their principal men was sent to each ofthese places; Thoas to Chalcis, Alexamenus to Lacedaemon, Diodesto Demetrias. This last was assisted by the exile Eurylochus, whoseflight, and the cause of it, have been mentioned above, because therewas no other prospect of his restoration to his country. Eurylochus,by letter, instructed his friends and relations, and those of his ownfaction, to order his wife and children to assume a mourning dress:and, holding the badges of supplicants, to go into a full assembly,and to beseech each individual, and the whole body, not to suffera man, who was innocent and uncondemned, to grow old in exile.The simple-minded were moved by compassion; the ill-disposed andseditious, by the hope of seeing all things thrown into confusion, inconsequence of the tumults which the Aetolians would excite; and everyone voted for his being recalled. These preparatory measures beingeffected, Diocles, at that time general of the horse, with all thecavalry, set out under pretext of escorting to his home the exile,who was his guest. Having, during that day and the following night,marched an extraordinary length of way, and arrived within six milesof the city at the first dawn, he chose out three troops, at the headof which he went on before the rest of the cavalry, whom he ordered tofollow. When he came near the gate he made all his men dismount, andlead their horses by the reins, without keeping their ranks, but liketravellers on a journey, in order that they might appear to be theretinue of the general, rather than a military force. Here he left onetroop at the gate, lest the cavalry, who were coming up, might be shutout; and then, holding Eurylochus by the hand, conducted him to hishouse through the middle of the city and the forum, and through crowdswho met and congratulated him. In a little time the city was filledwith horsemen, and convenient posts were seized; and then parties weresent to the houses of persons of the opposite faction, to put them todeath. In this manner Demetrias fell into the hands of the Aetolians."Book 35,Chapter 35,"At Lacedaemon, the city was not to be attempted by force, but thetyrant to be entrapped by stratagem. For though he had been strippedof the maritime towns by the Romans, and afterwards shut up within thewalls of his city by the Achaeans, they supposed that whoever took thefirst opportunity of killing him would engross the whole thanks of theLacedaemonians. The pretence which they had for sending to him, was,that he had long solicited assistance from them, since, by theiradvice, he had renewed the war. A thousand foot were put under thecommand of Alexamenus, with thirty horsemen, chosen from among theyouth. These received a charge from Damocritus, the praetor, in theselect council of the nation, mentioned above, ""not to suppose thatthey were sent to a war with the Achaeans; or even on other business,which any one might ascertain to himself from his own conjectures.Whatever sudden enterprise circumstances might direct Alexamenus toundertake, that (however unexpected, rash, or daring) they were tohold themselves in readiness to execute with implicit obedience;and should understand that to be the matter, for the sole purposeof effecting which they had been sent abroad."" With these men, thuspre-instructed, Alexamenus came to the tyrant, and, immediately onapproaching him, filled him with hopes; telling him, that ""Antiochushad already come over into Europe; that he would shortly be in Greece,and would cover the lands and seas with men and arms; that the Romanswould find that they had not Philip to deal with: that the numbers ofthe horsemen, footmen, and ships, could not be reckoned; and that thetrain of elephants, by their mere appearance, would effectually dauntthe enemy: that the Aetolians were prepared to come to Lacedaemon withtheir entire force, whenever occasion required; but that they wishedto show the king, on his arrival, a numerous body of troops: thatNabis himself, likewise, ought to take care not to suffer his soldiersto be enervated by inaction, and dwelling in houses; but to lead themout, and make them perform their evolutions under arms, which, whileit exercised their bodies, would also rouse their courage; that thelabour would become lighter by practice, and might even be renderednot unpleasing by the affability and kindness of their commander.""Thenceforward, the troops used frequently to be drawn out under thewalls of the city, in a plain near the river Eurotas. The tyrant'slife-guards were generally posted in the centre. He himself, attendedby three horsemen at the most, of whom Alexamenus was commonly one,rode about in front, and went to view both wings to their extremities.On the right wing were the Aetolians; both those who had been beforein his army as auxiliaries, and the thousand who came with Alexamenus.Alexamenus made it his custom to ride about with Nabis through a fewof the ranks, offering such advice as seemed most suitable; then tojoin his own troops in the right wing; and presently after, as ifhaving given the orders which the occasion might require, to return tothe tyrant. But, on the day which he had fixed for the perpetration ofthe deed of death, after accompanying the tyrant for a little time,he withdrew to his own soldiers, and addressed the horsemen, sentfrom home with him, in these words: ""Young men, that deed is now tobe dared and done which you were ordered to execute valiantly under myguidance. Have your courage and your hands ready, that none mayfail to second me in whatever he sees me attempt. If any one shallhesitate, and prefer any scheme of his own to mine, let him restassured that there is no return to his home for him."" Horror seizedthem all, and they well remembered the charge which they had receivedat setting out. The tyrant was now coming from the left wing.Alexamenus ordered his horsemen to rest their lances, and keep theireyes fixed on him; and in the mean time he himself recollected hisspirits, which had been discomposed by the meditation of such adesperate attempt. As soon as the tyrant came near, he charged him;and driving his spear through his horse, brought the rider to theground. The horsemen aimed their lances at him as he lay, and aftermany ineffectual strokes against his coat of mail, their points atlength penetrated his body, so that, before relief could be sent fromthe centre, he expired."Book 35,Chapter 36,"Alexamenus, with all the Aetolians, hastened away, to seize on thepalace. Nabis's life-guards were at first struck with horror, theact being perpetrated before their eyes; then, when they observed theAetolian troops leaving the place, they gathered round the tyrant'sbody, where it was left, forming, instead of guardians of his life oravengers of his death, a mere group of spectators. Nor would any onehave stirred, if Alexamenus had immediately called the people to anassembly, and, with his arms laid aside, there made a speech suitableto the occasion, and afterwards kept a good number of Aetolians inarms, without violence being offered to any one. Instead of which,by a fatality which ought to attend all designs founded in treachery,every step was taken that could tend to hasten the destruction ofthose who had committed it. The commander, shut up in the palace,wasted a day and a night in searching out the tyrant's treasures; andthe Aetolians, as if they had stormed the city, of which they wishedto be thought the deliverers, betook themselves to plunder. Theinsolence of their behaviour, and at the same time contempt of theirnumbers, gave the Lacedaemonians courage to assemble in a body, whensome said, that they ought to drive out the Aetolians, and resumetheir liberty, which had been ravished from them at the very time whenit seemed to be restored; others, that, for the sake of appearance,they ought to associate with them some one of the royal family, as thedirector of their efforts. There was a very young boy of that family,named Laconicus, who had been educated with the tyrant's children; himthey mounted on a horse, and taking arms, slew all the Aetolians whomthey met straggling through the city. They then assaulted the palace,where they killed Alexamenus, who, with a small party, attemptedresistance. Others of the Aetolians, who had collected together roundthe Chalciaecon, that is, the brazen temple of Minerva, were cut topieces. A few, throwing away their arms, fled, some to Tegea, othersto Megalopolis, where they were seized by the magistrates, and sold asslaves. Philopoemen, as soon as he heard of the murder of the tyrant,went to Lacedaemon, where, finding all in confusion and consternation,he called together the principal inhabitants, to whom he addressed adiscourse, (such as ought to have been made by Alexamenus,) and unitedthe Lacedaemonians to the confederacy of the Achaeans. To this theywere the more easily persuaded, because, at that very juncture, AulusAtilius happened to arrive at Gythium with twenty-four quinqueremes."Book 35,Chapter 37,"Meanwhile, Thoas, in his attempt on Chalcis, had by no meansthe same good fortune as Eurylochus had in getting possession ofDemetrias; although, (by the intervention of Euthymidas, a man ofconsiderable consequence, who, after the arrival of Titus Quinctiusand the ambassadors, had been banished by those who adhered to theRoman alliance; and also of Herodorus, who was a merchant of Cios,and who, by means of his wealth, possessed a powerful influence atChalcis,) he had engaged a party, composed of Euthymidas's faction, tobetray the city into his hands. Euthymidas went from Athens, wherehe had fixed his residence, first to Thebes, and thence to Salganea;Herodorus to Thronium. At a small distance, on the Malian bay, Thoashad two thousand foot and two hundred horse, with as many as thirtylight transport ships. With these vessels, carrying six hundredfootmen, Herodorus was ordered to sail to the island of Atalanta,that, as soon as he should perceive the land forces approaching Aulusand the Euripus, he might pass over from thence to Chalcis; to whichplace Thoas himself led the rest of his forces, marching mostly bynight, and with all possible expedition."Book 35,Chapter 38,"Mictio and Xenoclides, who were now, since the banishment ofEuthymidas, in possession of the supreme power, either of themselvessuspected the matter, or received some information of it, and were atfirst so greatly terrified, that they saw no prospect of safety butin flight; but afterwards, when their fright subsided, and theyconsidered that, by such a step, they would betray and desert not onlytheir country, but the Roman alliance, they applied their minds tothe following plan. It happened that, at that very time, there was asolemn anniversary festival, celebrated at Eretria, in honour of DianaAmarynthis, which was always attended by great numbers, not only ofthe natives, but also of the Carystians: thither they sent envoys tobeseech the Eretrians and Carystians, ""as having been born in the sameisle, to compassionate their situation; and, at the same time, toshow their regard to the friendship of Rome: not to suffer Chalcisto become the property of the Aetolians; that if they should possessChalcis they would obtain possession of all Euboea: and to remindthem, that they had found the Macedonians grievous masters, but thatthe Aetolians would be much more intolerable."" The considerationof the Romans chiefly influenced those states, as they had latelyexperienced both their bravery in war, and their justice andliberality in success. Both states, therefore, armed, and sent themain strength of their young men. To these the people of Chalcisintrusted the defence of the walls, and they themselves, with theirwhole force, crossed the Euripus, and encamped at Salganea. From thatplace they despatched, first a herald, and afterwards ambassadors, toask the Aetolians, for what word or act of theirs, friends and alliescame thus to invade them. Thoas, commander of the Aetolians, answered,that ""he came not to attack them, but to deliver them from the Romans;that they were fettered at present with a brighter chain indeed, buta much heavier one, than when they had a Macedonian garrison in theircitadel."" The men of Chalcis replied that ""they were neither underbondage to any one, nor in need of the protection of any."" Theambassadors then withdrew from the meeting, and returned to theircountrymen. Thoas and the Aetolians (who had no other hopes than ina sudden surprise, and were by no means in a capacity to undertakea regular war, and the siege of a city so well secured against anyattack from the land or the sea) returned home. Euthymidas, on hearingthat his countrymen were encamped at Salganea, and that the Aetolianshad retired, went back from Thebes to Athens. Herodorus, after waitingseveral days at Atalanta, attentively watching for the concertedsignal in vain, sent an advice-boat to learn the cause of thedelay; and, understanding that the enterprise was abandoned by hisassociates, returned to Thronium from whence he had come."Book 35,Chapter 39,"Quinctius, having been informed of these proceedings, came withthe fleet from Corinth, and met Eumenes in the Euripus of Chalcis.It was agreed between them, that king Eumenes should leave there fivehundred of his soldiers, for the purpose of a garrison, and shouldgo himself to Athens. Quinctius proceeded to Demetrias, as he hadpurposed from the first, hoping that the relief of Chalcis would provea strong inducement to the Magnetians to renew the alliance with Rome.And, in order that such of them as favoured his views might have somesupport at hand, he wrote to Eunomus, praetor of the Thessalians,to arm the youth; sending Villius forward to Demetrias, to sound theinclinations of the people: but not with a view to take any step inthe business, unless a considerable number of them were disposed torevive the former treaty of amity. Villius, in a ship of five banks ofoars, came to the mouth of the harbour, and the whole multitude ofthe Magnetians hastened out thither. Villius then asked, whether theychose that he should consider himself as having come to friends, orto enemies? Eurylochus, the Magnetarch, answered, that ""he had come tofriends; but desired him not to enter the harbour, but to suffer theMagnetians to live in freedom and harmony; and not to attempt, underthe show of friendly converse, to seduce the minds of the populace.""Then followed an altercation, not a conference, the Roman upbraidingthe Magnetians with ingratitude, and forewarning them of thecalamities impending over them; the multitude, on the other side,clamorously reproaching him, and reviling, sometimes the senate,sometimes Quinctius. Villius, therefore, unable to effect any partof his business, went back to Quinctius, who despatched orders to theThessalian praetor, to lead his troops home, while himself returnedwith his ships to Corinth."Book 35,Chapter 40,"The affairs of Greece, blended with those of Rome, have carried meaway, as it were, out of my course: not that they were in themselvesdeserving of a recital, but because they constituted the causes ofthe war with Antiochus. After the consular election, for thence Idigressed, the consuls, Lucius Quinctius and Cneius Domitius, repairedto their provinces; Quinctius to Liguria, Domitius against the Boians.The Boians kept themselves quiet; nay, the senators, with theirchildren, and the commanding officers of the cavalry, with theirtroops, amounting in all to one thousand five hundred, surrendered tothe consul. The other consul laid waste the country of the Liguriansto a wide extent, and took some forts: in which expeditions he notonly acquired booty of all sorts, together with many prisoners, but healso recovered several of his countrymen, and of the allies, who hadbeen in the hands of the enemy. In this year a colony was settledat Vibo, in pursuance of a decree of the senate and an order ofthe people; three thousand seven hundred footmen, and three hundredhorsemen, went out thither, conducted by the commissioners QuintusNaevius, Marcus Minucius, and Marcus Furius Crassipes. Fifteen acresof ground were assigned to each footman, double that quantity to ahorseman. This land had been last in possession of the Bruttians, whohad taken it from the Greeks. About this time two dreadful causesof alarm happened at Rome, one of which continued long, but was lessactive than the other. An earthquake lasted through thirty-eight days;during all which time there was a total cessation of business, amidstanxiety and fears. On account of this event, a supplication wasperformed of three days' continuance. The other was not a mere fright,but attended with the actual loss of many lives. In consequence of afire breaking out in the cattle-market, the conflagration, amongthe houses near to the Tiber, continued through all that day and thefollowing night, and all the shops, with wares of very great value,were reduced to ashes."Book 35,Chapter 41,"The year was now almost at an end, while the rumours of impendinghostility, and, consequently, the anxiety of the senate, dailyincreased. They therefore set about adjusting the provinces of themagistrates elect, in order that they might be all the more intenton duty. They decreed, that those of the consuls should be Italy, andwhatever other place the senate should vote, for every one knew thata war against Antiochus was now a settled point. That he, to whoselot the latter province fell, should have under his command,--of Romancitizens, four thousand foot and three hundred horse; and of the Latinconfederates, six thousand foot and four hundred horse. The consul,Lucius Quinctius, was ordered to levy these troops, that no delaymight be occasioned, but that the new consul might be able to proceedimmediately to any place which the senate should appoint. Concerningthe provinces of the praetors, also, it was decreed, that the firstlot should comprehend the two jurisdictions, both that betweennatives, and that between them and foreigners; the second should beBruttium; the third, the fleet, to sail wherever the senate shoulddirect; the fourth, Sicily; the fifth, Sardinia; the sixth, FartherSpain. An order was also given to the consul Lucius Quinctius, to levytwo new legions of Roman citizens, and of the allies and Latins twentythousand foot and eight hundred horse. This army they assigned to thepraetor to whom should fall the province of Bruttium. Two temples werededicated this year to Jupiter in the Capitol; one of which had beenvowed by Lucius Furius Purpureo, when praetor during the Gallic war;the other by the same, when consul. Quintus Marcius Ralla, duumvir,dedicated both. Many severe sentences were passed this year onusurers, who were prosecuted, as private persons, by the curuleaediles, Marcus Tuccius and Publius Junius Brutus. Out of the finesimposed on those who were convicted, gilded chariots, with fourhorses, were placed in the recess of Jupiter's temple in the Capitol,over the canopy of the shrine, and also twelve gilded bucklers. Thesame aediles built a portico on the outside of the Triple Gate, in theCarpenters' Square."Book 35,Chapter 42,"While the Romans were busily employed in preparing for a new war,Antiochus, on his part, was not idle. Three cities detained him sometime, Smyrna, Alexandria in Troas, and Lampsacus, which hitherto hehad not been able either to reduce by force, or to persuade into atreaty of amity; and he was unwilling, on going into Europe, to leavethese behind (as enemies). A deliberation also respecting Hannibaloccasioned him further delay. First, the open ships, which theking was to have sent with him to Africa, were slowly prepared, andafterwards a consultation was set on foot whether he ought to be sentat all, chiefly by Thoas the Aetolian; who, after setting all Greecein commotion, came with the account of Demetrias being in the hands ofhis countrymen; and as he had, by false representations concerning theking, and multiplying, in his assertions, the numbers of his forces,exalted the expectations of many in Greece; so now, by the sameartifices, he puffed up the hopes of the king; telling him, that""every one was inviting him with their prayers, and that there wouldbe a general rush to the shore, from which the people could catch aview of the royal fleet."" He even had the audacity to attempt alteringthe king's judgment respecting Hannibal when it was nearly settled.For he alleged, that ""the fleet ought not to be weakened by sendingaway any part of it, but that if ships must be sent no person wasless fit for the command than Hannibal, for he was an exile and aCarthaginian, to whom his own circumstances or his disposition mightdaily suggest a thousand new schemes. Then as to his military fame,by which, as by a dowry, he was recommended to notice, it was toosplendid for an officer acting under a king. The king ought to be thegrand object of view; the king ought to appear the sole leader, thesole commander. If Hannibal should lose a fleet or an army the amountof the damage would be the same as if the loss were incurred by anyother general; but should success be obtained, all the honour would beascribed to Hannibal, and not to Antiochus. Besides, if the warshould prove so fortunate as to terminate finally in the defeat of theRomans, could it be expected that Hannibal would live under a king;subject, in short, to an individual; he who could scarcely bearsubjection to his own country? That he had not so conducted himselffrom early youth, having embraced the empire of the globe in his hopesand aspirations, that in his old age he would be likely to endure amaster. The king wanted not Hannibal as a general: as an attendant anda counsellor in the business of the war, he might properly employ him.A moderate use of such abilities would be neither unprofitable nordangerous; but if advantages of the highest nature were sought throughhim, they, probably, would be the destruction both of the giver andthe receiver."""Book 35,Chapter 43,"There are no dispositions more prone to envy than those of personswhose mental qualifications are inferior to their birth and rank inlife; because they are indignant both at the merit and the possessionsof another. The design of the expedition, to be commanded by Hannibal,the only one thought of that could be of use, in the beginning of thewar, was immediately laid aside. The king, highly flattered by thedefection of Demetrias from the Romans to the Aetolians, resolved todelay no longer his departure into Greece. Before the fleet weighedanchor he went up from the shore to Ilium, to offer sacrifice toMinerva. Immediately on his return he set sail with forty decked shipsand sixty open ones, followed by two hundred transports, laden withprovisions and warlike stores. He first touched at the island ofImbrus; thence he passed over to Sciathus; whence, after collectingthe ships which had been separated during the voyage, he proceededto Pteleum, toe nearest part of the continent. Here, Eurylochus theMagnetarch, and other principal Magnetians from Demetrias, met him.Being greatly gratified by their numerous appearance, he carried hisfleet the next day into the harbour of their city. At a small distancefrom the town he landed his forces, which consisted of ten thousandfoot, five hundred horse, and six elephants; a force scarcelysufficient to take possession of Greece alone, much less to sustaina war with Rome. The Aetolians, as soon as they were informed ofAntiochus's arrival at Demetrias, convened a general council, andpassed a decree, inviting him into their country. The king had alreadyleft Demetrias, (for he knew that such a decree was to be passed,) andhad advanced as far as Phalara on the Malian bay. Here the decreewas presented to him, and then he proceeded to Lamia, where he wasreceived by the populace with marks of the warmest attachment,with clapping of hands and shouting, and other signs by which theextravagant joy of the vulgar is testified."Book 35,Chapter 44,"When he came into the council he was introduced by Phaeneas, thepraetor, and other persons of eminence, who, with difficulty, madeway for him through the crowd. Then, silence being ordered, the kingaddressed himself to the assembly. He began with accounting for hishaving come with a force so much smaller than every one had hoped andexpected. ""That,"" he said, ""ought to be deemed the strongest proof ofthe warmth of his good-will towards them; because, though he was notsufficiently prepared in any particular, and though the season was yettoo early for sailing, he had, without hesitation, complied with thecall of their ambassadors, and had believed that when the Aetoliansshould see him among them they would be satisfied that in him, even ifhe were unattended, they might be sure of every kind of support. Buthe would also abundantly fulfil the hopes of those, whose expectationsseemed at present to be disappointed. For as soon as the season of theyear rendered navigation safe, he would cover all Greece with arms,men, and horses, and all its coasts with fleets. He would spareneither expense, nor labour, nor danger, until he should remove theRoman yoke from their necks, and render Greece really free, and theAetolians the first among its states. That, together with the armies,stores of all kinds were to come from Asia. For the present theAetolians ought to take care that his men might be properly suppliedwith corn, and other accommodations, at reasonable rates."""Book 35,Chapter 45,"Having addressed them to this purport, and with universalapprobation, the king withdrew. After his departure a warm debateensued between two of the Aetolian chiefs, Phaeneas and Thoas.Phaeneas declared his opinion, that it would be better to employAntiochus, as a mediator of peace, and an umpire respecting thematters in dispute with the Roman people, than as leader in a war.That ""his presence and his dignified station would impress the Romanswith awe, more powerfully than his arms. That in many cases men, forthe sake of avoiding war, voluntarily remit pretensions, which forceand arms would never compel them to forego."" Thoas, on the other hand,insisted, that ""Phaeneas's motive was not a love of peace, but a wishto embarrass their preparations for war, with the view that, throughthe tediousness of the proceedings, the king's vigour might be relaxedand the Romans gain time to put themselves in readiness. That they hadabundant proof from experience, after so many embassies sent toRome, and so many conferences with Quinctius in person, that nothingreasonable could ever be obtained from the Romans in the way ofnegotiation; and that they would not, until every hope of that sortwas out of sight, have implored the aid of Antiochus. That as he hadappeared among them sooner than any had expected, they ought not tosink into indolence, but rather to petition the king, that since hehad come in person, which was the great point of all, to support therights of Greece, he would also send for his fleets and armies. Forthe king, at the head of an army, might obtain something, but withoutthat could have very little influence with the Romans, either in thecause of the Aetolians, or even in his own."" This opinion was adopted,and the council voted, that the title of general should be conferredon the king. They also nominated thirty distinguished men with whomhe might deliberate on any business which he might think proper.--Thecouncil was then broken up, and all went home to their respectivestates."Book 35,Chapter 46,"Next day the king held a consultation with their select council,respecting the place from whence his operations should commence. Theyjudged it best to make the first trial on Chalcis, which had latelybeen attempted in vain by the Aetolians; and they thought thatthe business required rather expedition than any great exertion orpreparation. Accordingly the king, with a thousand foot, who hadfollowed him from Demetrias, took his route through Phocis; and theAetolian chiefs, going by another road, met at Cheronaea a smallnumber of their young men whom they had called to arms, and thence, inten decked ships, proceeded after him. Antiochus pitched his camp atSalganea, while himself, with the Aetolian chiefs, crossed the Euripusin the ships. When he had advanced a little way from the harbour, themagistrates and other chief men of Chalcis came out before their gate.A small number from each side met to confer together. The Aetolianswarmly recommended to the others, ""without violating the friendshipsubsisting between them and the Romans, to receive the king also asa friend and ally; for that he had crossed into Europe not for thepurpose of making war, but of vindicating the liberty of Greece; andof vindicating it in reality, not in words and pretence merely, as theRomans had done. Nothing could be more advantageous to the states ofGreece than to embrace the alliance of both, as they would then bealways secure against ill-treatment from either, under the guaranteeand protection of the other. If they refuse to receive the king, theyought to consider what they would have immediately to suffer; the aidof the Romans being far distant, and Antiochus, whom with their ownstrength they could not possibly resist, in character of an enemy attheir gates."" To this Mictio, one of the Chalcian deputies, answeredthat ""he wondered who those people were, for the vindicating of whoseliberty Antiochus had left his own kingdom, and come over into Europe.For his part he knew not any state in Greece which either containeda garrison, or paid tribute to the Romans, or was bound by adisadvantageous treaty, and obliged to submit to terms which it didnot like. The people of Chalcis, therefore, stood not in need, eitherof any assertor of their liberty, which they already enjoyed, or ofany armed protector, since, through the kindness of the Roman people,they were in possession of both liberty and peace. They did not slightthe friendship of the king, nor that of the Aetolians themselves. Thefirst instance of friendship, therefore, that they could give, wouldbe to quit the island and go home; for, as to themselves, they werefully determined not only not to admit them within their walls, butnot even to agree to any alliance, but with the approbation of theRomans."""Book 35,Chapter 47," When an account of this conference was brought to the king, atthe ships where he had staid, he resolved for the present to return toDemetrias; for he had not come to them with a sufficient number ofmen to attempt any thing by force. At Demetrias he held anotherconsultation with the Aetolians, to determine what was next to bedone, as their first effort had proved fruitless. It was agreed thatthey should make trial of the Botians, Achaeans, and Amynander, kingof the Athamanians. The Boeotianan nation they believed to have beendisaffected to the Romans, ever since the death of Brachyllas, and theconsequences which followed it. Philopoemen, chief of the Achaeans,they supposed to hate, and be hated by, Quinctius, in consequence of arivalship for fame in the war of Laconia. Amynander had married Apama,daughter of a Megalopolitan, called Alexander, who, pretending to bedescended from Alexander the Great, had given the names of Philip andAlexander to his two sons, and that of Apama to his daughter; and whenshe was raised to distinction, by her marriage to the king, Philip,the elder of her brothers had followed her into Athamania. Thisman, who happened to be naturally vain, then Aetolians and Antiochuspersuaded to hope (as he was really of the royal family) for thesovereignty of Macedonia, on condition of his prevailing on Amynanderand the Athamanians to join Antiochus; and these empty promisesproduced the intended effect, not only on Philip but likewise onAmynander."Book 35,Chapter 48,"In Achaia, the ambassadors of Antiochus and the Aetolians wereadmitted to an audience of the council at Aegium, in the presence ofTitus Quinctius. The ambassador of Antiochus was heard prior to theAetolians. He, with all that pomp and parade which is common amongthose who are maintained by the wealth of kings, covered, as far asthe empty sound of words could go, both lands and seas (with forces).He said, that ""an innumerable body of cavalry was coming over theHellespont into Europe; some of them cased in coats of mail, whom theycall Cataphracti; others discharging arrows on horseback; and, whatrendered it impossible to guard against them, shooting with thesurest aim even when their backs were turned, and their horses in fullretreat. To this army of cavalry, sufficient to crush the forces ofall Europe, collected into one body,"" he added another of infantryof many times its number; and to terrify them, repeated the namesof nations scarcely ever heard of before: talking of Dahans, Medes,Elymaeans, and Cadusians. ""As to the naval forces, no harboursin Greece were capable of containing them; the right squadron wascomposed of Sidonians and Tyrians; the left of Aradians and Sidetians,from Pamphylia.--nations which none others had ever equalled, eitherin courage, or skill in sea affairs. Then, as to money, and otherrequisites for the support of war, it was needless for him to speak.They themselves knew, that the kingdoms of Asia had always abounded ingold. The Romans, therefore, had not now to deal with Philip, or withHannibal; the one a principal member of a commonwealth, the otherconfined merely to the limits of the kingdom of Macedonia; but withthe great monarch of all Asia, and part of Europe. Nevertheless,though he had come from the remotest bounds of the East to givefreedom to Greece, he did not demand any thing from the Achaeans, thatcould injure the fidelity of their engagements with the Romans, theirformer friends and allies. For he did not require them to take arms onhis side against them; but only, that they should not join themselvesto either party. That, as became common friends, they should wish forpeace to both parties, and not intermeddle in the war."" Archidamus,ambassador of the Aetolians, made nearly the same request: that, aswas their easiest and safest way, they should stand neuter; and, asmere spectators of the war, wait for the decision of the fortunes ofothers, without any hazard to their own interests. He afterwards wasbetrayed, by the intemperance of language, into invectives, sometimesagainst the Romans in general, sometimes against Quinctius himself inparticular; charging them with ingratitude, and upbraiding them,as being indebted to the valour of the Aetolians, not only for thevictory over Philip, but even for their preservation; for, ""by theirexertions, both Quinctius himself and his army had been saved. Whatduty of a commander had he ever discharged? He used to see him,indeed, in the field, taking auspices; sacrificing, and offering vows,like an insignificant soothsaying priest; while he himself was, in hisdefence, exposing his person to the weapons of the enemy."""Book 35,Chapter 49,"To this Quinctius replied, that ""Archidamus had calculated hisdiscourse for the numerous auditors, rather than for the persons towhom it was particularly addressed. For the Achaeans very well knew,that the bold spirit of the Aetolians consisted entirely in words, notin deeds; and was more displayed in their councils and assembliesthan in the field. He had therefore been indifferent concerningthe sentiments of the Achaeans, to whom he and his countrymen wereconscious that they were thoroughly known; and studied to recommendhimself to the king's ambassadors, and, through them, to their absentmaster. But, if any person had been hitherto ignorant of the causewhich had united Antiochus and the Aetolians, it was easy todiscover it from the language of their ambassadors. By the falserepresentations made by both parties, and boasts of strength whichneither possessed, they mutually puffed up each other; and werethemselves puffed up with vain expectations: one party talking ofPhilip being vanquished by them, the Romans being protected by theirvalour, and the rest of what you have just heard; and that you, andthe other states and nations, would follow their party. The king,on the other side, boasting of clouds of horsemen and footmen,and covering the seas with his fleets. The king,"" he added, ""wasexceedingly like a supper that I remember at the house of my host atChalcis, who is both a man of worth, and an excellent conductor ofa feast. Having been kindly entertained by him at midsummer, when wewondered how he could, at that time of the year, procure such plentyand variety of game, he, not being so vain-glorious as these men, toldus, with a pleasant smile, that the variety was owing to the dressing,and that what appeared to be the flesh of many different wild animals,was entirely of tame swine. This may be aptly applied to the forcesof the king, which were so ostentatiously displayed a while ago; thatthose various kinds of armour, and multitudinous names of nations,never heard of before, Dahans, and Medes, and Caducians, andElymaeans, are nothing more than Syrians, a race possessed of suchgrovelling souls, as to be much fitter for slaves than for soldiers. Iwish, Achaeans, that I could exhibit to your view the rapid excursionsof this mighty monarch from Demetrias; first, to Lamia, to the councilof the Aetolians; then to Chalcis. You should behold, in the royalcamp, about the number of two small legions, and these incomplete. Youshould see the king, now, in a manner begging corn from the Aetolians,to be measured out to his soldiers; then, striving to borrow moneyat interest to pay them; again, standing at the gates of Chalcis, andpresently, on being refused admittance, returning thence into Aetolia,without having effected any thing, except indeed the taking a peep atAulis and the Euripus. Both Antiochus had done wrong in trustingto the Aetolians, and the Aetolians in trusting to the king's vainboastings. For which reason, you ought the less to be deceived bythem, and rather to confide in the tried and approved fidelity of theRomans. For, with respect to your not interfering in the war, whichthey recommend as your best course, nothing, in fact, can be morecontrary to your interest: for then, without gaining thanks or esteem,you will become the prize of the conqueror."""Book 35,Chapter 50,"He was thought to have replied to both by no means unsuitably; andthere was no difficulty in bringing an audience, prepossessed in hisfavour, to give their approbation to his discourse. In fact, therewas no debate or doubt started, but all concurred in voting, that thenation of the Achaeans would regard, as their friends or foes, thosewho were judged to be such by the Roman people, and in ordering warto be declared against both Antiochus and the Aetolians. They also,by the direction of Quinctius, sent immediate succours of five hundredmen to Chalcis, and five hundred to the Piraeus; for affairs atAthens were in a state not far from a civil war, in consequence of theendeavours, used by some, to seduce the venal populace, by hopes oflargesses, to take part with Antiochus. But at length Quinctius wascalled thither by those who were of the Roman party; and Apollodorus,the principal adviser of a revolt, being publicly charged therewith byone Leon, was condemned and driven into exile. Thus, from the Achaeansalso, the embassy returned to the king with a discouraging answer.The Boeotians made no definitive reply; they only said, that ""whenAntiochus should come into Boeotia, they would then deliberate on themeasures proper to be pursued."" When Antiochus heard, that both theAchaeans and king Eumenes had sent reinforcements to Chalcis, heresolved to act with the utmost expedition, that his troops mightget the start of them, and, if possible, intercept the others as theycame; and he sent thither Menippus with about three thousand soldiers,and Polyxenidas with the whole fleet. In a few days after, he marchedhimself, at the head of six thousand of his own soldiers, and asmaller number of Aetolians, as many as could be collected in haste,out of those who were at Lamia. The five hundred Achaeans, and a smallparty sent by king Eumenes, being guided by Xenoclides, of Chalcis,(the roads being yet open,) crossed the Euripus, and arrived atChalcis in safety. The Roman soldiers, who were likewise about fivehundred, came, after Menippus had fixed his camp under Salganea, atHermaeus, the place of passage from Boeotia to the island ofEuboea. They had with them Mictio, who had been sent from Chalcis toQuinctius, deputed to solicit that very reinforcement; and when heperceived that the passes were blocked up by the enemy, he quittedthe road to Aulis, and turned away to Delium, with intent to pass overthence to Euboea."Book 35,Chapter 51,"Delium is a temple of Apollo, standing over the sea five milesdistant from Tanagra; and the passage thence, to the nearest part ofEuboea, is less than four miles. As they were in this sacred buildingand grove, sanctified with all that religious awe and those privilegeswhich belong to temples, called by the Greeks asylums, (war not beingyet either proclaimed, or so far commenced as that they had heard ofswords being drawn, or blood shed any where,) the soldiers in perfecttranquillity, amused themselves, some with viewing the temple andgroves; others with walking about unarmed, on the strand; and a greatpart had gone different ways in quest of wood and forage; when, on asudden, Menippus attacked them in that scattered condition, slew many,and took fifty of them prisoners. Very few made their escape, amongwhom was Mictio, who was received on board a small trading vessel.Though this event caused much grief to Quinctius and the Romans, onaccount of the loss of their men, yet it seemed to add much to thejustification of their cause in making war on Antiochus. Antiochus,when arrived with his army so near as Aulis, sent again to Chalcisa deputation, composed partly of his own people, and partly ofAetolians, to treat on the same grounds as before, but with heavierdenunciations of vengeance: and, notwithstanding all the efforts ofMictio and Xenoclides to the contrary, he easily gained his object,that the gates should be opened to him. Those who adhered to the Romaninterest, on the approach of the king, withdrew from the city. Thesoldiers of the Achaeans, and Eumenes, held Salganea; and the fewRomans, who had escaped, raised, for the security of the place, alittle fort on the Euripus. Menippus laid siege to Salganea, and theking himself to the fort. The Achaeans and Eumenes' soldiers firstsurrendered, on the terms of being allowed to retire in safety. TheRomans defended the Euripus with more obstinacy. But even these,when they were completely invested both by land and sea, and saw themachines and engines prepared for an assault, sustained the siege nolonger. The king, having thus got possession of the capital ofEuboea, the other cities of the island did not even refuse to obeyhis authority; and he seemed to himself to have signalized thecommencement of the war by an important acquisition, in having broughtunder his power so great an island, and so many cities convenientlysituated."Book 36,Chapter 1,"Publius Cornelius Scipio, son of Cneius, and Manius AciliusGlabrio, the consuls, on their assuming the administration, wereordered by the senate, before they settled any thing respecting theirprovinces, to perform sacrifices, with victims of the greater kinds,at all the shrines, where the Lectisternium was usually celebrated forthe greater part of the year; and to offer prayers, that the businesswhich the state had in contemplation, concerning a new war, mightterminate prosperously and happily for the senate and people of Rome.At every one of those sacrifices, appearances were favourable, andthe propitious omens were found in the first victims. Accordingly, theauspices gave this answer:--That, by this war, the boundaries of theRoman empire would be enlarged; and that victory and triumph wereportended. When this answer was reported, the senate, having theirminds now freed from superstitious fears, ordered this question to beproposed to the people; ""Was it their will, and did they order, thatwar should be undertaken against king Antiochus, and all who shouldjoin his party?"" And that if that order passed, then the consuls were,if they thought proper, to lay the business entire before the senate.Publius Cornelius got the order passed; and then the senate decreed,that the consuls should cast lots for the provinces of Italy andGreece; that he to whose lot Greece fell, should, in addition to thenumber of soldiers enlisted and raised from the allies by Quinctiusfor that province, pursuant to a decree of the senate, take underhis command that army, which, in the preceding year, Marcus Baebius,praetor, had, by order of the senate, carried over to Macedonia.Permission was also granted him, to receive succours from the allies,out of Italy, if circumstances should so require, provided theirnumber did not exceed five thousand. It was resolved, that LuciusQuinctius, consul of the former year, should be commissioned as alieutenant-general in that war. The other consul, to whom Italy fell,was ordered to carry on the war with the Boians, with whichever heshould choose of the two armies commanded by the consuls of the lastyear; and to send the other to Rome; and these were ordered to be thecity legions, and ready to march to whatever place the senate shoulddirect."Book 36,Chapter 2,"Things being thus adjusted in the senate, excepting the assignmentof his particular province to each of the magistrates, the consulswere ordered to cast lots. Greece fell to Acilius, Italy to Cornelius.The lot of each being now determined, the senate passed a decree, that""inasmuch as the Roman people had, at that time, ordered war tobe declared against king Antiochus, and those who were under hisgovernment, the consuls should command a supplication to be performed,on account of that business; and that Manius Acilius, the consul,should vow the great games to Jupiter, and offerings at all theshrines."" This vow was made by the consul in these words, which weredictated by Publius Licinius, chief pontiff: ""If the war, which thepeople has ordered to be undertaken against king Antiochus, shall beconcluded agreeably to the wishes of the senate and people of Rome,then, O Jupiter, the Roman people will, through ten successive days,exhibit the great games in honour of thee, and offerings shall bepresented at all the shrines, of such value as the senate shalldirect. Whatever magistrate shall celebrate those games, and atwhatever time and place, let the celebration be deemed proper, and theofferings rightly and duly made."" The two consuls then proclaimeda supplication for two days. When the consuls had determined theirprovinces by lot, the praetors, likewise, immediately cast lots fortheirs. The two civil jurisdictions fell to Marcus Junius Brutus;Bruttium, to Aulus Cornelius Mammula; Sicily, to Marcus AemiliusLepidus; Sardinia, to Lucius Oppius Salinator; the fleet, to CaiusLivius Salinator; and Farther Spain, to Lucius Aemilius Paullus. Thetroops for these were settled thus:--to Aulus Cornelius were assignedthe new soldiers, raised last year by Lucius Quinctius, the consul,pursuant to the senate's decree; and he was ordered to defend thewhole coast near Tarentum and Brundusium. Lucius Aemilius Paullus wasdirected to take with him into Farther Spain, (to fill up the numbersof the army, which he was to receive from Marcus Fulvius, propraetor,)three thousand new-raised foot and three hundred horse, of whomtwo-thirds should be Latin allies, and the other third Roman citizens.An equal reinforcement was sent to Hither Spain to Caius Flaminius,who was continued in command. Marcus Aemilius Lepidus was ordered toreceive both the province and army from Lucius Valerius, whom he wasto succeed; and, if he thought proper, to retain Lucius Valerius, aspropraetor, in the province, which he was to divide with him in sucha manner, that one division should reach from Agrigentum to Pachynum,and the other from Pachynum to Tyndarium, and the sea-coasts whereofLucius Valerius was to protect with a fleet of twenty ships of war.The same praetor received a charge to levy two-tenths of corn, and totake care that it should be carried to the coast, and thence conveyedinto Greece. Lucius Oppius was likewise commanded to levy a secondtenth in Sardinia; but it was resolved that it should be transported,not into Greece, but to Rome. Caius Livius, the praetor, whose lot wasthe command of the fleet, was ordered to sail, at the earliest timepossible, to Greece with thirty ships, which were ready, and toreceive the other fleet from Atilius. The praetor, Marcus Junius,was commissioned to refit and arm the old ships which were in thedock-yards; and, for this fleet, to enlist the sons of freemen ascrews."Book 36,Chapter 3,"Commissaries were sent into Africa, three to Carthage, and a likenumber to Numidia, to procure corn to be carried into Greece; forwhich the Roman people were to pay the value. And so attentive was thestate to the making of every preparation and provision necessaryfor the carrying on of this war, that the consul, Publius Cornelius,published an edict, that ""no senator, nor any who had the privilege ofgiving an opinion in the senate, nor any of the inferior magistrates,should go so far from the city of Rome as that they could not returnthe same day; and that five senators should not be absent from thecity at the same time."" A dispute which arose with the maritimecolonies, for some time retarded Caius Livius, the praetor, whenactively engaged in fitting out the fleet. For, when they wereimpressed for manning the ships, they appealed to the tribunes ofthe people, by whom the cause was referred to the senate. The senate,without one dissenting voice, resolved, that those colonies werenot entitled to exemption from the sea-service. The colonies whichdisputed with the praetor on the subject of exemption were, Ostia,Fregenae, Castrumnovum, Pyrgi, Antium, Tarracina, Minturnae, andSinuessa. The consul, Manius Acilius, then, by direction of thesenate, consulted the college of heralds, ""whether a declaration ofwar should be made to Antiochus in person, or whether it would besufficient to declare it at some garrison town; whether they directeda separate declaration against the Aetolians, and whether theiralliance and friendship ought not to be renounced before war wasdeclared."" The heralds answered, that ""they had given their judgmentbefore, when they were consulted respecting Philip, that it was of noconsequence whether the declaration were made to himself in person, orat one of his garrisons. That, in their opinion, friendship had beenalready renounced; because, after their ambassadors had so oftendemanded restitution, the Aetolians had not thought proper to makeeither restitution or apology. That these, by their own act, had madea declaration of war against themselves, when they seized, by force,Demetrias, a city in alliance with Rome; when they laid siege toChalcis by land and sea; and brought king Antiochus into Europe,to make war on the Romans."" Every preparatory measure being nowcompleted, the consul, Manius Acilius, issued an edict, thatthe ""soldiers enlisted, or raised from among the allies by TitusQuinctius, and who were under orders to go with him to his province;as, likewise, the military tribunes of the first and third legions,should assemble at Brundusium, on the ides of May.[1]"" He himself,on the fifth before the nones of May,[2] set out from the city in hismilitary robe of command. At the same time the praetors, likewise,departed for their respective provinces."Book 36,Chapter 4,"A little before this time, ambassadors came to Rome from the twokings, Philip of Macedonia and Ptolemy of Egypt, offering aid ofmen, money, and corn towards the support of the war. From Ptolemy wasbrought a thousand pounds' weight of gold, and twenty thousand pounds'weight of silver. None of this was accepted. Thanks were returned tothe kings. Both of them offered to come, with their whole force,into Aetolia. Ptolemy was excused from that trouble; and Philip'sambassadors were answered, that the senate and people of Rome wouldconsider it as a kindness if he should lend his assistance tothe consul, Manius Acilius. Ambassadors came, likewise from theCarthaginians, and from king Masinissa. The Carthaginians made anoffer of sending a thousand pecks[1] of wheat, and five hundredthousand of barley to the army, and half that quantity to Rome; whichthey requested the Romans to accept from them as a present. Theyalso offered to fit out a fleet at their own expense, and to give in,immediately, the whole amount of the annual tribute-money which theywere bound to pay for many years to come. The ambassadors of Masinissapromised, that their king should send five hundred thousand pecks ofwheat, and three hundred thousand of barley, to the army in Greece,and three hundred thousand of wheat, and two hundred and fiftythousand of barley, to Rome; also five hundred horse, and twentyelephants, to the consul Acilius. The answer given to both, withregard to the corn, was, that the Roman people would make use of it,provided they would receive payment for the same. With regard to thefleet offered by the Carthaginians, no more was accepted than suchships as they owed by treaty; and, as to the money, they were told,that none would be taken before the regular days of payment."Book 36,Chapter 5,"While these things were occurring at Rome, Antiochus, during thewinter season at Chalcis, endeavoured to bring over several of thestates by ambassadors sent among them; while many of their own accordsent deputies to him; as the Epirots, by the general voice of thenation, and the Eleans from Peloponnesus. The Eleans requested aidagainst the Achaeans; for they supposed, that, since the war had beendeclared against Antiochus contrary to their judgment, the Achaeanswould first turn their arms against them. One thousand foot were sentto them, under the command of Euphanes, a Cretan. The embassy of theEpirots showed no mark whatever of a liberal or candid disposition.They wished to ingratiate themselves with the king; but, at thesame time, to avoid giving cause of displeasure to the Romans. Theyrequested him, ""not hastily to make them a party in the dispute,exposed, as they were, opposite to Italy, and in the front of Greece,where they must necessarily undergo the first assaults of the Romans.If he himself, with his land and sea forces, could take charge ofEpirus, the inhabitants would eagerly receive him in all their portsand cities. But if circumstances allowed him not to do that, then theyearnestly entreated him not to subject them, naked and defenceless, tothe arms of the Romans."" Their intention in sending him this messageevidently was, that if he declined going into Epirus, which theyrather supposed would be the case, they were not implicated withrelation to the Roman armies, while they sufficiently recommendedthemselves to the king by their willingness to receive him on hiscoming; and that, on the other hand, if he should come, even then theywould have hopes of being pardoned by the Romans, for having yieldedto the strength of a prince who was present among them, withoutwaiting for succour from them, who were so far distant. To this soevasive embassy, as he did not readily think of a proper answer, hereplied, that he would send ambassadors to them to confer upon suchmatters as were of common concernment both to him and them."Book 36,Chapter 6,"Antiochus went himself into Boeotia, holding out ostensiblythose causes of resentment against the Romans which I have alreadymentioned,--the death of Brachyllas, and the attack made by Quinctiuson Coronea, on account of the massacre of the Roman soldiers; whilethe real ones were, that the former excellent policy of that nation,with respect both to public and private concerns, had, for severalgenerations, been on the decline; and that great numbers were in suchcircumstances, that they could not long subsist without some changein affairs. Through multitudes of the principal Boeotians, whoevery where flocked out to meet him, he arrived at Thebes. There,notwithstanding that he had (both at Delium, by the attack made on theRoman troops, and also at Chalcis) already commenced hostilities, byenterprises of neither a trifling nor of a dubious nature, yet, ina general council of the nation, he delivered a speech of the sameimport with that which he delivered in the first conference atChalcis, and that used by his ambassadors in the council of theAchaeans; that ""what he required of them was, to form a league offriendship with him, not to declare war against the Romans."" But nota man among them was ignorant of his meaning. However, a decree,disguised under a slight covering of words, was passed in his favouragainst the Romans. After securing this nation also on his side, hereturned to Chalcis; and, having despatched letters, summoning thechief Aetolians to meet him at Demetrias, that he might deliberatewith them on the general plan of operations, he came thither with hisships on the day appointed for the council. Amynander, likewise,was called from Athamania to the consultation; and Hannibal theCarthaginian, who, for a long time before, had not been askedto attend, was present at this assembly. The subject of theirdeliberation was in reference to the Thessalian nation; and every onepresent was of opinion, that their concurrence ought to be sought.The only points on which opinions differed were, that some thought theattempt ought to be made immediately; while others judged it better todefer it for the winter season, which was then about half spent,until the beginning of spring. Some advised to send ambassadors only;others, that the king should go at the head of all his forces, and ifthey hesitated, terrify them into compliance."Book 36,Chapter 7,"Although the present debate turned chiefly on these points,Hannibal, being called on by name to give his opinion, led the king,and those who were present, into the consideration of the generalconduct of the war, by a speech to this effect:--""If I had beenemployed in your councils since we came first into Greece, when youwere consulting about Euboea, the Achaeans, and Boeotians, I wouldhave offered the same advice which I shall offer you this day, whenyour thoughts are employed about the Thessalians. My opinion is, that,above all things, Philip and the Macedonians should by some means orother be brought into a participation in this war. For, as to Euboea,as well as the Boeotians and Thessalians, who can doubt that, havingno strength of their own, they will ever court the power that ispresent; and will make use of the same fear, which governs theircouncils, as an argument for obtaining pardon? That, as soon asthey shall see a Roman army in Greece, they will turn away to thatgovernment to which they have been accustomed? Nor are they to blame,if, when the Romans were at so great a distance, they did not chooseto try your force, and that of your army, who were on the spot. Howmuch more advisable, therefore, and more advantageous would it be, tounite Philip to us, than these; as, if he once embarks in the cause,he will have no room for retreat, and as he will bring with him sucha force, as will not only be an accession to a power at war with Rome,but was able, lately, of itself, to withstand the Romans! With such anally, (I wish to speak without offence,) how could I harbour a doubtabout the issue; when I should see the very persons through whom theRomans prevailed against Philip, now ready to act against them?The Aetolians, who, as all agree, conquered Philip, will fightin conjunction with Philip against the Romans. Amynander and theAthamanian nation, who, next to the Aetolians, performed the greatestservices in that war, will stand on our side. Philip, at the time whenyou remained inactive, sustained the whole burden of the war. Now, youand he, two of the greatest kings, will, with the force of Asia andEurope, wage war against one state; which, to say nothing of my ownfortune with them, either prosperous or adverse, was certainly, inthe memory of our fathers, unequal to a dispute with a single king ofEpirus; what then, I say, must it be in competition with you two? Butit may be asked. What circumstances induce me to believe that Philipmay be brought to a union with us? First, common utility, which is thestrongest cement of union; and next, you, Aetolians, are yourselvesmy informants. For Thoas, your ambassador, among the other argumentswhich he used to urge, for the purpose of drawing Antiochus intoGreece, always above all things insisted upon this,--that Philipexpressed extreme indignation that the conditions of servitude hadbeen imposed on him under the appearance of conditions of peace:comparing the king's anger to that of a wild beast chained, or shutup, and wishing to break the bars that confined it. Now, if his temperof mind is such, let us loose his chains; let us break these bars,that he may vent, upon the common foe, this anger so long pent up. Butshould our embassy fail of producing any effect on him, let us thentake care, that if we cannot unite him to ourselves, he may not beunited to our enemies. Your son, Seleucus, is at Lysimachia; and if,with the army which he has there, he shall pass through Thrace, andonce begin to make depredations on the nearest parts of Macedonia, hewill effectually divert Philip from carrying aid to the Romans, tothe protection, in the first place, of his own dominions. Such is myopinion respecting Philip. With regard to the general plan of the war,you have, from the beginning, been acquainted with my sentiments: andif my advice had been listened to, the Romans would not now hear thatChalcis in Euboea was taken, and a fort on the Euripus reduced, butthat Etruria, and the whole coast of Liguria and Cisalpine Gaul, werein a blaze of war; and, what is to them the greatest cause of alarm,that Hannibal was in Italy. Even as matters stand at present, Irecommend it to you, to call home all your land and sea forces; letstoreships with provisions follow the fleet; for, as we are here toofew for the exigencies of the war, so are we too many for the scantysupplies of necessaries. When you shall have collected together thewhole of your force, you will divide the fleet, and keep one divisionstationed at Corcyra, that the Romans may not have a clear and safepassage; and the other you will send to that part of the coast ofItaly which is opposite Sardinia and Africa; while you yourselves,with all the land forces, will proceed to the territory of Bullium. Inthis position you will hold the command of all Greece; you will givethe Romans reason to think, that you intend to sail over to Italy;and you will be in readiness so to do, if occasion require. This ismy advice; and though I may not be the most skilful in every kind ofwarfare, yet surely I must have learned, in a long series of both goodand bad fortune, how to wage war against the Romans. For the executionof the measures which I have advised, I promise you my most faithfuland zealous endeavours. Whatever plan you shall consider the best, maythe gods grant it their approbation."""Book 36,Chapter 8,"Such, nearly, was the counsel given by Hannibal, which the hearersrather commended at the time, than actually executed. For not onearticle of it was carried into effect, except the sending Polyxenidasto bring over the fleet and army from Asia. Ambassadors were sent toLarissa, to the diet of the Thessalians. The Aetolians and Amynanderappointed a day for the assembling of their troops at Pherae, and theking with his forces came thither immediately. While he waited therefor Amynander and the Aetolians, he sent Philip, the Megalopolitan,with two thousand men, to collect the bones of the Macedonians roundCynoscephalae, where the final battle had been fought with kingPhilip; being advised to this, either in order to gain favour with theMacedonians and draw their displeasure on the king for having lefthis soldiers unburied, or having of himself, through the spirit ofvain-glory incident to kings, conceived such a design,--splendidindeed in appearance, but really insignificant. There is a mount thereformed of the bones which had been scattered about, and were thencollected into one heap. Although this step procured him no thanksfrom the Macedonians, yet it excited the heaviest displeasure ofPhilip; in consequence of which, he who had hitherto intended toregulate his counsels by the fortune of events, now sent instantly amessage to the propraetor, Marcus Baebius, that ""Antiochus had madean irruption into Thessaly; that, if he thought proper, he should moveout of his winter quarters, and that he himself would advance to meethim, that they might consider together what was proper to be done."""Book 36,Chapter 9,"While Antiochus lay encamped near Pherae, where the Aetoliansand Amynander had joined him, ambassadors came to him from Larissa,desiring to know on account of what acts or words of theirs he hadmade war on the Thessalians; at the same time requesting him towithdraw his army; and that if there seemed to him any necessity forit he would discuss it with them by commissioners. In the mean time,they sent five hundred soldiers, under the command of Hippolochus, toPherae, as a reinforcement; but these, being debarred of access by theking's troops, who blocked up all the roads, retired to Scotussa. Theking answered the Larissan ambassadors in mild terms, that ""he cameinto their country, not with a design of making war, but of protectingand establishing the liberty of the Thessalians."" He sent a personto make a similar declaration to the people of Pherae; who,without giving him any answer, sent to the king, in the capacity ofambassador, Pausanias, the first magistrate of their state. He offeredremonstrances of a similar kind with those which had been urged inbehalf of the people of Chalcis, at the first conference, on thestrait of the Euripus, as the cases were similar, and urged some witha greater degree of boldness; on which the king desired that theywould consider seriously before they adopted a resolution, which,while they were overcautious and provident of futurity, would givethem immediate cause of repentance, and then dismissed him. When thePheraeans were acquainted with the result of this embassy, without thesmallest hesitation they determined to endure whatever the fortune ofwar might bring on them, rather than violate their engagements withthe Romans. They accordingly exerted their utmost efforts to providefor the defence of their city; while the king, on his part, resolvedto assail the walls on every side at once; and considering, what wasevidently the case, that it depended on the fate of this city, thefirst which he had besieged, whether he should for the future bedespised or dreaded by the whole nation of the Thessalians, he put inpractice every where all possible means of striking them with terror.The first fury of the assault they supported with great firmness;but in some time, great numbers of their men being either slainor wounded, their resolution began to fail. Having soon beenso reanimated by the rebukes of their leaders, as to resolve onpersevering in their resistance, and having abandoned the exteriorcircle of the wall, as their numbers now began to fail, they withdrewto the interior part of the city, round which had been raised afortification of less extent. At last, being overcome by distress, andfearing that if they were taken by storm they might meet no mercy fromthe conqueror, they capitulated. The king then lost no time; but whilethe alarm was fresh, sent four thousand men against Scotussa, whichsurrendered without delay, observing the recent example of those inPherae; who, at length compelled by sufferings, had done that whichat first they had obstinately refused. Together with the town,Hippolochus and the Larissan garrison were yielded to him, all of whomwere dismissed uninjured by the king; who hoped that such behaviourwould operate powerfully towards conciliating the esteem of theLarissans."Book 36,Chapter 10,"Having accomplished all this within the space of ten days afterhis arrival at Pherae, he marched with his whole force to Cranon,which he took immediately on his arrival. He then took Cypaera andMetropolis, and the forts which lay around them; and now every townin all that tract was in his power, except Atrax and Gyrton. He nextresolved to lay siege to Larissa, for he thought that (either throughdread inspired by the storming of the other towns, or in considerationof his kindness in dismissing the troops of their garrison, or beingled by the example of so many cities surrendering themselves) theywould not continue longer in their obstinacy. Having ordered theelephants to advance in front of the battalions, for the purpose ofstriking terror, he approached the city with his army in order ofbattle, on which the minds of a great number of the Larissans becameirresolute and perplexed, between their fears of the enemy attheir gates, and their respect for their distant allies. Meantime,Amynander, with the Athamanian troops, seized on Pellinaeus; whileMenippus, with three thousand Aetolian foot and two hundred horse,marched into Perrhaebia, where he took Mallaea and Cyretiae byassault, and ravaged the lands of Tripolis. After executing theseenterprises with despatch, they returned to the king at Larissa justwhen he was holding a council on the method of proceeding with regardto that place. On this occasion there were opposite opinions: for somethought that force should be applied; that there was no time to belost, but that the walls should be immediately attacked with worksand machines on all sides at once; especially as the city stood in aplain, the entrances open, and the approaches every where level.While others represented at one time the strength of the city, greaterbeyond comparison than that of Pherae; at another, the approach ofthe winter season, unfit for any operation of war, much more so forbesieging and assaulting cities. While the king's judgment was insuspense between hope and fear, his courage was raised by ambassadorshappening to arrive just at the time from Pharsalus, to make surrenderof their city. In the mean time Marcus Baebius had a meeting withPhilip in Dassaretia; and, in conformity to their joint opinion, sentAppius Claudius to reinforce Larissa, who, making long marches throughMacedonia, arrived at that summit of the mountains which overhangGonni. The town of Gonni is twenty miles distant from Larissa,standing at the opening of the valley called Tempe. Here, by layingout his camp more widely than his numbers required, and kindling morefires than were necessary, he imposed on the enemy the opinion whichhe wished, that the whole Roman army was there, and king Philip alongwith them. Antiochus, therefore, pretending the near approach ofwinter as his motive, staid but one day longer, then withdrew fromLarissa, and returned to Demetrias. The Aetolians and Athamaniansretired to their respective countries. Appius, although he sawthat, by the siege being raised, the purpose of his commission wasfulfilled, yet resolved to go down to Larissa, to strengthen theresolution of the allies against future contingencies. Thus theLarissans enjoyed a twofold happiness, both because the enemy haddeparted from their country, and because they saw a Roman garrisonwithin their city."Book 36,Chapter 11,"Antiochus went from Demetrias to Chalcis, where he becamecaptivated with a young woman, daughter of Cleoptolemus. When hehad plied her father, who was unwilling to connect himself witha condition in life involving such serious consequences, first bymessages, and afterwards by personal importunities, and had at lengthgained his consent; he celebrated his nuptials in the same manneras if it were a time of profound peace. Forgetting the two importantundertakings in which he was at once engaged,--the war with Rome, andthe liberating of Greece,--he banished every thought of businessfrom his mind, and spent the remainder of winter in feasting and thepleasures connected with wine; and then in sleep, produced ratherby fatigue than by satiety with these things. The same spirit ofdissipation seized all his officers who commanded in the severalwinter quarters, particularly those stationed in Boeotia, and even thecommon men abandoned themselves to the same indulgences; not one ofwhom ever put on his armour, or kept watch or guard, or did anypart of the duty or business of a soldier. When, therefore, in thebeginning of spring, the king came through Phocis to Chaeronea, wherehe had appointed the general assembly of all the troops, he perceivedat once that the soldiers had spent the winter under discipline nomore rigid than that of their commander. He ordered Alexander, anAcarnanian and Menippus, a Macedonian, to lead his forces thenceto Stratum, in Aetolia; and he himself, after offering sacrifice toApollo at Delphi, proceeded to Naupactum. After holding a council ofthe chiefs of Aetolia, he went by the road which leads by Chalcis andLysimachia to Stratum, to meet his army, which was coming alongthe Malian bay. Here Mnasilochus, a man of distinction among theAcarnanians, being bribed by many presents, not only laboured himselfto dispose that nation in favour of the king, but had brought to aconcurrence in the design their praetor, Clytus, who was at that timeinvested with the highest authority. This latter, finding that thepeople of Leucas, the capital of Acarnania, could not be easilyseduced to defection, because they were afraid of the Roman fleets,one under Atilius, and another at Cephallenia, practised an artificeagainst them. He observed in the council, that the inland parts ofAcarnania should be guarded from danger, and that all who were ableto bear arms ought to march out to Medio and Thurium, to prevent thoseplaces from being seized by Antiochus, or the Aetolians; on whichthere were some who said, that there were no necessity for all thepeople to be called out in that hasty manner, for a body of fivehundred men would be sufficient for the purpose. Having got thisnumber of soldiers at his disposal, he placed three hundred ingarrison at Medio, and two hundred at Thurium, with the design thatthey should fall into the hands of the king, and serve hereafter ashostages."Book 36,Chapter 12,"At this time, ambassadors from the king came to Medio, whoseproposal being heard, the assembly began to consider what answershould be returned to the king; when some advised to adhere to thealliance with Rome, and others, not to reject the friendship of theking; but Clitus offered an opinion, which seemed to take a middlecourse between the other two, and which was therefore adopted. Itwas, that ambassadors should be sent to the king, to request of himto allow the people of Medio to deliberate on a subject of such greatimportance in a general assembly of the Acarnanians. Mnasilochus, andsome others of his faction, were studiously included in this embassy;who, sending private messengers to desire the king to bring up hisarmy, wasted time on purpose; so that the ambassadors had scarcely setout, when Antiochus appeared in the territory, and presently at thegates of the city; and, while those who were not concerned in the plotwere all in hurry and confusion, and hastily called the young men toarms, he was conducted into the place by Clitus and Mnasilochus. Oneparty of the citizens now joined him through inclination, and thosewho were of different sentiments were compelled by fear to attend him.He then calmed their apprehensions by a discourse full of mildness;and in the hope of experiencing his clemency, which was reportedabroad, several of the states of Acarnania went over to his side. FromMedio he went to Thurium, whither he had sent on before him the sameMnasilochus, and his colleagues in the embassy. But the detection ofthe treachery practised at Medio rendered the Thurians more cautious,but not more timid. They answered him explicitly, that they would formno new alliance without the approbation of the Romans: they then shuttheir gates, and posted soldiers on the walls. Most seasonably forconfirming the resolution of the Acarnanians, Cneius Octavius, beingsent by Quinctius, and having received a party of men and a few shipsfrom Aulus Postumius, whom Atilius had appointed his lieutenant tocommand at Cephallenia, arrived at Leucas, and filled the allieswith hope; assuring them, that the consul Manius Acilius had alreadycrossed the sea with his legions, and that the Roman camp was inThessaly. As the season of the year, which was by this time favourablefor sailing, strengthened the credibility of this report, the king,after placing a garrison in Medio and borne other towns of Acarnania,retired from Thurium and returned through the cities of Aetolia andPhocis to Chalcis."Book 36,Chapter 13,"About the same time, Marcus Baebius and king Philip, after themeeting which they had in the winter in Dassaretia, when they sentAppius Claudius into Thessaly to raise the siege of Larissa, hadreturned to winter quarters, the season not being sufficientlyadvanced for entering on action; but now in the beginning of spring,they united their forces, and marched into Thessaly. Antiochus wasthen in Acarnania. As soon as they entered that country, Philip laidsiege to Mallaea, in the territory of Perrhaebia, and Baebius, toPhacium. This town of Phacium he took almost at the first attempt, andthen reduced Phaestus with the same rapidity. After this, he retiredto Atrax; and from thence having seized on Cyretiae and Eritium, andplaced garrisons in the places which he had reduced, he again joinedPhilip, who was carrying on the siege of Mallaea. On the arrival ofthe Roman army, the garrison, either awed by its strength, or hopingfor pardon, surrendered themselves, and the combined forces marched,in one body, to recover the towns which had been seized by theAthamanians. These were Aeginium, Ericinum, Gomphi, Silana, Tricca,Meliboea, and Phaloria. Then they invested Pellinaeum, where Philip ofMegalopolis was in garrison, with five hundred foot and forty horse;but before they made an assault, they sent messengers to warn Philipnot to expose himself to the last extremities; to which he answered,with much confidence, that he could intrust himself either to theRomans or the Thessalians, but never would put himself in the power ofthe Macedonian. When it appeared that recourse must be had to force,and that Limnaea might be attacked at the same time; it was agreed,that the king should go against Limnaea, while Baebius staid to carryon the siege of Pellinaeum."Book 36,Chapter 14,"It happened that, just at this time, the consul, Manius Acilius,having crossed the sea with twenty thousand foot, two thousand horse,and fifteen elephants, ordered some military tribunes, chosen forthe purpose, to lead the infantry to Larissa, and he himself withthe cavalry came to Limnaea, to Philip. Immediately on the consul'sarrival a surrender was made without hesitation, and the king'sgarrison, together with the Athamanians, were delivered up.From Limnaea the consul went to Pellinaeum. Here the Athamanianssurrendered first, and afterwards Philip of Megalopolis. King Philip,happening to meet the latter as he was coming out from the town,ordered his attendants, in derision, to salute him with the titleof king; and he himself, coming up to him, with a sneer, highlyunbecoming his own exalted station, addressed him as Brother.Having been brought before the consul he was ordered to be kept inconfinement, and soon after was sent to Rome in chains. All the restof the Athamanians, together with the soldiers of king Antiochus, whohad been in garrison in the towns which surrendered about that time,were delivered over to Philip. They amounted to three thousand men.The consul went thence to Larissa, in order to hold a consultation onthe general plan of operations; and on his way was met by ambassadorsfrom Pieria and Metropolis, with the surrender of those cities.Philip treated the captured, particularly the Athamanians, withgreat kindness, in order that through them he might conciliate theircountrymen; and having hence conceived hopes of getting Athamaniainto his possession, he first sent forward the prisoners to theirrespective states, and then marched his army thither. These also,making mention of the king's clemency and generosity towards them,exerted a powerful influence on the minds of their fellow-countrymen;and Amynander, who, by his presence, had retained many in obedience,through the respect paid to his dignity, began now to dread thathe might be delivered up to Philip, who had been long his professedenemy, or to the Romans, who were justly incensed against him for hislate defection. He, therefore, with his wife and children, quitted thekingdom, and retired to Ambracia. Thus all Athamania came under theauthority and dominion of Philip. The consul delayed a few days atLarissa, for the purpose chiefly of refreshing the horses, which, bythe voyage first, and marching afterwards, had been much harassed andfatigued; and when he had renewed the vigour of his army by a moderateshare of rest, he marched to Cranon. On his way, Pharsalus, Scotussa,and Pherae were surrendered to him, together with the garrisons placedin them by Antiochus. He asked these men whether any of them chose toremain with him; and one thousand having declared themselves willing,he gave them to Philip; the rest he sent back, unarmed, to Demetrias.After this he took Proerna, and the forts adjacent; and then began tomarch forwards toward the Malian bay. When he drew near to the passon which Thaumaci is situated, all the young men of that place, havingtaken arms and quitted the town, placed themselves in ambush in thewoods and roads, and thence, from the higher grounds, made attacks onthe Roman troops as they marched. The consul first sent people totalk with them from a short distance, and deter them from such a madproceeding; but, finding that they persisted in their undertaking, hesent round a tribune, with two companies of soldiers, to cut off theretreat of the men in arms, and took possession of the defencelesscity. The shouting on the capture of the city having been heard frombehind, a great slaughter was made of those who had been in ambuscade,and who fled homewards from all parts of the woods. From Thaumaci theconsul came, on the second day, to the river Spercheus; and, sendingout parties, laid waste the country of the Hypataeans."Book 36,Chapter 15,"During these transactions, Antiochus was at Chalcis; and now,perceiving that he had gained nothing from Greece agreeable, exceptwinter quarters and a disgraceful marriage at Chalcis, he warmlyblamed Thoas, and the fallacious promises of the Aetolians; while headmired Hannibal, not only as a prudent man, but as the predicter ofall those events which were then transpiring. However, that he mightnot still further defeat his inconsiderate enterprise by his owninactivity, he sent requisitions to the Aetolians, to arm alltheir young men, and assemble in a body at Lamia. He himself alsoimmediately led thither about ten thousand foot (the number havingbeen filled up out of the troops which had come after him from Asia)and five hundred horse. Their assembly on this occasion was far lessnumerous than ever before, none attending but the chiefs with a fewof their vassals. These affirmed that they had, with the utmostdiligence, tried every method to bring into the field as great anumber as possible out of their respective states, but that they hadnot prevailed either by argument, persuasion, or authority, againstthose who declined the service. Being disappointed thus on all sides,both by his own people, who delayed in Asia, and by his allies, whodid not fulfil those engagements by which they had prevailed on himto comply with their invitation, the king retired beyond the passof Thermopylae. A range of mountains here divides Greece in the samemanner as Italy is divided by the ridge of the Apennines. Outsidethe strait of Thermopylae, towards the north, lie Epirus, Perrhaebia,Magnesia, Thessaly, the Achaean Phthiotis, and the Malian bay; on theinside, towards the south, the greater part of Aetolia, Acarnania,Phocis, Locris, Boeotia, and the adjacent island of Euboea, theterritory of Attica, which stretches out like a promontory into thesea, and, behind that, the Peloponnesus. This range of mountains,which extends from Leucas and the sea on the west, through Aetolia tothe opposite sea on the east, is so closely covered with thicketsand craggy rocks, that, not to speak of an army, even persons lightlyequipped for travelling can with difficulty find paths through whichthey can pass. The hills at the eastern extremity are called Oeta, andthe highest of them Callidromus; in a valley, at the foot of which,reaching to the Malian bay, is a passage not broader than sixty paces.This is the only military road by which an army can be led, even if itshould not be opposed. The place is therefore called Pylae, the gate;and by some, on account of a warm spring, rising just at the entranceof it, Thermopylae. It is rendered famous by the memorable battleof the Lacedaemonians against the Persians, and by their still moreglorious death."Book 36,Chapter 16,"With a very inferior portion of spirit, Antiochus now pitched hiscamp within the enclosures of this pass, the difficulties of whichhe increased by raising fortifications; and when he had completelystrengthened every part with a double rampart and trench, and,wherever it seemed requisite, with a wall formed of the stones whichlay scattered about in abundance, being very confident that the Romanarmy would never attempt to force a passage there, he sent away onehalf of the four thousand Aetolians, the number that had joined him,to garrison Heraclea, which stood opposite the entrance of the defile,and the other half to Hypata; for he concluded, that the consul wouldundoubtedly attack Heraclea, and he received accounts from many hands,that all the districts round Hypata were being laid waste. The consul,after ravaging the lands of Hypata first, and then those of Heraclea,in both which places the Aetolian detachments proved useless, encampedopposite to the king, in the very entrance of the pass, near thewarm springs; both parties of the Aetolians shutting themselves up inHeraclea. Antiochus, who, before he saw the enemy, thought everyspot perfectly well fortified, and secured by guards, now began toapprehend, that the Romans might discover some paths among the hillsabove, through which they could make their way; for he had heard thatthe Lacedaemonians formerly had been surrounded in that manner by thePersians, and Philip, lately, by the Romans themselves. He thereforedespatched a messenger to the Aetolians at Heraclea, desiring them toafford him so much assistance, at least in the war, as to seize andsecure the tops of the hills, so that the Romans might not be able topass them at any part. When this message was received, a dissensionarose among the Aetolians: some insisted that they ought to obeythe king's orders, and go; others, that they ought to lie still atHeraclea, and wait the issue, whatever it might be; for if the kingshould be defeated by the consul, their forces would be fresh, and inreadiness to carry succour to their own states in the neighbourhood;and if he were victorious, they could pursue the Romans, whilescattered in their flight. Each party not only adhered positively toits own plan, but even carried it into execution; two thousand laystill at Heraclea; and two thousand, divided into three parties, tookpossession of the summits called Callidromus, Rhoduntia, and Tichiuns."Book 36,Chapter 17,"When the consul saw that the heights were possessed by theAetolians, he sent against those posts two men of consular rank, whoacted as lieutenant-generals, with two thousand chosen troops;--LuciusValerius Flaccus against Rhoduntia and Tichiuns, and Marcus PorciusCato against Callidromus. Then, before he led on his forces againstthe enemy, he called them to an assembly, and thus briefly addressedthem: ""Soldiers, I see that the greater part of you who were present,of all ranks, are men who served in this same province, under theconduct and auspices of Titus Quinctius. Now, in the Macedonian war,the pass at the river Aous was much more difficult than this beforeus. For this is only a gate, a single passage, formed as it were bynature; every other in the whole tract, between the two seas, beingimpassable. In the former case, there were stronger fortifications,and placed in more advantageous situations. The enemy's army wasboth more numerous, and composed of very superior men; for they wereMacedonians, Thracians, and Illyrians,--all nations of the fiercestspirit; your present opponents are Syrians, and Asiatic Greeks, themost unsteady of men, and born for slavery. The commander, there, wasa king of extraordinary warlike abilities, improved by practice fromhis early youth, in wars against his neighbours, the Thracians andIllyrians, and all the adjoining nations. But this man is one who(to say nothing of his former life) after coming over from Asia intoEurope to make war on the Roman people, has, during the whole lengthof the winter, accomplished no more memorable exploit, than the takinga wife, for passion's sake, out of a private house, and a familyobscure even among its neighbours; and now as a newly married man,surfeited as it were with nuptial feasts, comes out to fight. Hischief reliance and strength was in the Aetolians,--a nation ofall others the most faithless and ungrateful, as you have formerlyexperienced, and as Antiochus now experiences; for they neither joinedhim with numbers, nor could they be kept in the camp; and, besides,they are now in a state of dissension among themselves. Although theyrequested permission to defend Hypata and Heraclea, yet they defendedneither; but one half of them fled to the tops of the mountains, whilethe others shut themselves up in Heraclea. The king himself, plainlyconfessing that, so far from daring to meet us in battle on the levelplain, he durst not even encamp in open ground, has abandoned all thattract in front, which he boasted of having taken from us and Philip,and has hid himself behind the rocks; not even appearing in theopening of the pass, as it is said the Lacedaemonians did formerly,but drawing back his camp completely within it. What difference isthere, as a demonstration of fear, between this and his shuttinghimself up within the walls of a city to stand a siege? But neithershall the straits protect Antiochus, nor the hills which they haveseized, the Aetolians. Sufficient care and precaution have been usedon every quarter, that you shall have nothing to contend with in thefight but the enemy himself. On your parts, you have to consider, thatyou are not fighting merely for the liberty of Greece; although, werethat all, it would be an achievement highly meritorious to deliverthat country now from Antiochus and the Aetolians, which you formerlydelivered from Philip; and that the wealth in the king's camp will notbe the whole prize of your labour; but that the great collection ofstores, daily expected from Ephesus, will likewise become your prey;and also, that you will open a way for the Roman power into Asia andSyria, and all the most opulent realms to the extremity of the East.What then must be the consequence, but that, from Gades to the RedSea, we shall have no limit but the ocean, which encircles in itsembrace the whole orb of the earth; and that all mankind shall regardthe Roman name with a degree of veneration next to that which theypay to the divinities? For the attainment of prizes of such magnitude,prepare a spirit adequate to the occasion, that, to-morrow, with theaid of the gods, we may decide the matter in the field."""Book 36,Chapter 18,"After this discourse he dismissed the soldiers, who, before theywent to their repast, got ready their armour and weapons. At the firstdawn, the signal of battle being displayed, the consul formed histroops with a narrow front, adapted to the nature and the straitnessof the ground. When the king saw the enemy's standards in motion,he likewise drew out his forces. He placed in the van, before therampart, a part of his light infantry; and behind them, as a support,close to the fortifications, the main strength of his Macedonians,whom they call Sarissophori. On the left wing of these, at the footof the mountain, he posted a body of javelin-bearers, archers, andslingers; that from the higher ground they might annoy the naked flankof the enemy: and on the right of the Macedonians, to the extremity ofthe works, where the deep morasses and quicksands, stretching thenceto the sea, render the place impassable, the elephants with theirusual guard; in the rear of them, the cavalry; and then, with amoderate interval between, the rest of his forces as a second line.The Macedonians, posted before the rampart, for some time easilywithstood the efforts which the Romans made every where to force apassage; for they received great assistance from those who poured downfrom the higher ground a shower of leaden balls from their slings,and of arrows, and javelins, all together. But afterwards, the enemypressing on with greater and now irresistible force, they were obligedto give ground, and, filing off from the rear, retire within thefortification. Here, by extending their spears before them, theyformed as it were a second rampart, for the rampart itself was of sucha moderate height that, while it afforded to its defenders a highersituation, they at the same time, by the length of their spears, hadthe enemy within reach underneath. Many, inconsiderately approachingthe work, were run through the body; and they must either haveabandoned the attempt and retreated, or have lost very great numbers,had not Marcus Porcius come from the summit of Callidromus, whence hehad dislodged the Aetolians, after killing the greater part of them.These he had surprised, quite unprepared, and mostly asleep, and nowhe appeared on the hill which overlooked the camp."Book 36,Chapter 19,"Flaccus had not met the same good fortune at Tichiuns andRhoduntia; having failed in his attempts to approach those fastnesses.The Macedonians, and others, in the king's camp, as long as, onaccount of the distance, they could distinguish nothing more than abody of men in motion, thought they were the Aetolians, who, on seeingthe fight, were coming to their aid. But when, on a nearer view, theyknew the standards and arms, and thence discovered their mistake,they were all instantly seized with such a panic, that they threw downtheir arms and fled. Both the fortifications retarded the pursuers,and the narrowness of the valley through which the troops had to pass;and, above all, the circumstance that the elephants were on the rearof the enemy. These the infantry could with difficulty pass, and thecavalry could by no means do so, their horses being so frightened,that they threw one another into greater confusion than when inbattle. The plundering of the camp also caused a considerable delay.But, notwithstanding all this, the Romans pursued the enemy that dayas far as Scarphea, killing and taking on the way great numbers bothof men and horses, and also killing such of the elephants as theycould not capture; and then they returned to their camp. This had beenattacked, during the time of the action, by the Aetolians who wereoccupying Heraclea as a garrison, but the enterprise, which certainlyshowed no want of boldness, was not attended with any success. Theconsul, at the third watch of the following night, sent forward hiscavalry in pursuit of the enemy; and, as soon as day appeared, set outat the head of the legions. The king had got far before him, as hedid not halt in his precipitate flight until he came to Elatia. Therehaving collected the survivors of the battle and the retreat, he, witha very small body of half-armed men, betook himself to Chalcis. TheRoman cavalry did not overtake the king himself at Elatia; but theycut off a great part of his soldiers, who either halted throughweariness, or wandered out of the way through mistake, as they fledwithout guides through unknown roads; so that, out of the whole army,not one escaped except five hundred, who kept close about the king;and even of the ten thousand men, whom, on the authority of Polybius,we have mentioned as brought over by the king from Asia, a verytrifling number got off. But what shall we say if we are to believeValerius Antias, who records that there were in the king's army sixtythousand men, of whom forty thousand fell, and above five thousandwere taken, with two hundred and thirty military standards? Of theRomans were slain in the action itself a hundred and fifty; and of theparty that defended themselves against the assault of the Aetolians,not more than fifty."Book 36,Chapter 20,"As the consul was leading his army through Phocis and Boeotia, therevolted states, conscious of their defection, and dreading lest theyshould be exposed as enemies to the ravages of the soldiers,presented themselves at the gates of their cities, with the badges ofsuppliants; but the army proceeded, during the whole time, just as ifthey were in the country of friends, without offering violence of anysort, until they reached the territory of Coronea. Here a statue ofking Antiochus, standing in the temple of Minerva Itonia, kindledtheir indignation, and permission was given to the soldiers toplunder the lands adjacent to the edifice. But the reflection quicklyoccurred, that, as the statue had been erected by a general voteof all the Boeotian states, it was unreasonable to resent it on thesingle district of Coronea. The soldiers were therefore immediatelyrecalled, and the depredations stopped. The Boeotians were onlyreprimanded for their ungrateful behaviour to the Romans in return forsuch great obligations, so recently conferred. At the very time ofthe battle, ten ships belonging to the king, with their commanderIsidorus, lay at anchor near Thronium, in the Malian bay. To themAlexander of Acarnania, being grievously wounded, made his escape, andgave an account of the unfortunate issue of the battle; on whichthe fleet, alarmed at the immediate danger, sailed away in haste toCenaeus in Euboea. There Alexander died, and was buried. Three otherships, which came from Asia to the same port, on hearing the disasterwhich had befallen the army, returned to Ephesus. Isidorus sailed overfrom Cenaeus to Demetrias, supposing that the king might perhaps havedirected his flight thither. About this time Aulus Atilius, commanderof the Roman fleet, intercepted a large convoy of provisions going tothe king, just as they had passed the strait at the island of Andros:some of the ships he sunk, and took many others. Those who were in therear turned their course to Asia. Atilius, with the captured vesselsin his train, sailed back to Piraeus, from whence he had set out, anddistributed a vast quantity of corn among the Athenians and the otherallies in that quarter."Book 36,Chapter 21,"Antiochus, quitting Chalcis before the arrival of the consul,sailed first to Tenus, and thence passed over to Ephesus. When theconsul came to Chalcis, the gates were open to receive him: forAristoteles, who commanded for the king, on hearing of his approach,had withdrawn from the city. The rest of the cities of Euboea alsosubmitted without opposition; and peace being restored all over theisland within the space of a few days, without inflicting punishmenton any city, the army, which had acquired much higher praise formoderation after victory, than even for the victory itself, was ledback to Thermopylae. From this place, the consul despatched MarcusCato to Rome, that through him the senate and people might learn whathad been achieved from unquestionable authority. He set sail fromCreusa, a sea-port belonging to the Thespians, seated at the bottom ofthe Corinthian Gulf, and steered to Patrae, in Achaia. From Patrae, hecoasted along the shores of Aetolia and Acarnania, as far as Corcyra,and thence he passed over to Hydruntum, in Italy. Proceeding hence,with rapid expedition, by land, he arrived on the fifth day at Rome.Having come into the city before day, he went on directly from thegate to Marcus Junius, the praetor, who, at the first dawn, assembledthe senate. Here, Lucius Cornelius Scipio, who had been despatched bythe consul several days before Cato, and on his arrival had heard thatthe latter had outstripped him, and was then in the senate, camein, just as he was giving a recital of the transactions. The twolieutenant-generals were then, by order of the senate, conducted tothe assembly of the people, where they gave the same account, asin the senate, of the services performed in Aetolia. Hereupon asupplication of three days' continuance was decreed, and that thepraetor should offer sacrifice to such of the gods as his judgmentshould direct, with forty victims of the larger kinds. About the sametime, Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, who, two years before, had gone intoFarther Spain, in the office of praetor, entered the city in ovation.He carried in the procession a hundred and thirty thousand silverdenarii,[1] and besides the coin, twelve thousand pounds' weight ofsilver, and a hundred and twenty-seven pounds' weight of gold."Book 36,Chapter 22,"The consul Manius Acilius sent on, from Thermopylae, a message tothe Aetolians in Heraclea, admonishing them, ""then at least, after theexperience which they had of the emptiness of the king's professions,to return to their senses; and, by surrendering Heraclea, to endeavourto procure from the senate a pardon for their past madness, or error:that other Grecian states also had, during the present war, revoltedfrom the Romans, to whom they were under the highest obligations; butthat, inasmuch as, after the flight of the king, in reliance upon whomthey had departed from their duty, they had not added obstinacy totheir misbehaviour, they were re-admitted into friendship. In likemanner, although the Aetolians had not followed in the steps of theking, but had invited him, and had been principals in the war,not auxiliaries; nevertheless, if they could bring themselves torepentance they might still insure their safety."" As their answer tothese suggestions showed nothing like a pacific disposition, and itwas evident that the business must be determined by force of arms, andthat, notwithstanding the defeat of the king, the war of Aetoliawas as far from a conclusion as ever, Acilius removed his campfrom Thermopylae to Heraclea; and on the same day rode on horsebackentirely round the walls, in order to acquaint himself with thelocalities of the city. Heraclea is situated at the foot of MountOeta; the town itself is in the plain, but has a citadel overlookingit, which stands on an eminence of considerable height, terminated onall sides by precipices. Having examined every part which he wished tosee, the consul determined to make the attack in four places at once.On the side next the river Asopus, where is also the Gymnasium, hegave the direction of the works and the assault to Lucius Valerius.He assigned to Tiberius Sempronius Longus the attack of a part ofthe suburbs, which was as thickly inhabited as the city itself. Heappointed Marcus Baebius to act on the side opposite the Malian bay,a part where the access was far from easy; and Appius Claudius on theside next to another rivulet, called Melas; opposite to the temple ofDiana. By the vigorous emulation of these the towers, rams, and othermachines used in the besieging of towns, were all completed within afew days. The lands round Heraclea, naturally marshy, and aboundingwith tall trees, furnished timber in abundance for every kind ofwork; and then, as the Aetolians had fled into the city, the desertedsuburbs supplied not only beams and boards, but also bricks andmortar, and stones of every size for all their various occasions."Book 36,Chapter 23,"The Romans carried on the assault upon this city by means of worksmore than by their arms; the Aetolians, on the contrary, maintainedtheir defence by dint of arms. For when the walls were shaken by theram they did not, as is usual, intercept and turn aside the strokesby the help of nooses formed on ropes, but sallied out in large armedbodies, with parties carrying fire, which they threw into the works.They had likewise arched passages through the parapet, for the purposeof making sallies; and when they built up the wall anew, in the roomof any part that was demolished, they left a great number of these,that they might rush out upon the enemy from many places at once. Inseveral days at the beginning, while their strength was unimpaired,they carried on this practice in numerous parties, and with muchspirit, but afterwards in smaller numbers and more languidly. Forthough they had a multiplicity of difficulties to struggle with, whatabove all things utterly consumed their vigour was the want of sleep,as the Romans, having plenty of men, relieved each other regularly intheir posts; while among the Aetolians, their numbers being small, thesame persons had their strength consumed by unremitting labour nightand day. During a space of twenty-four days, without any time beingunemployed in the conflict, their toil was kept up against the attackscarried on by the enemy in four different quarters at once. When theconsul, from computing the time, and from the reports of deserters,judged that the Aetolians were thoroughly fatigued, he adopted thefollowing plan:--At midnight he gave the signal of retreat, anddrawing off all his men at once from the assault, kept them quiet inthe camp until the third hour of the next day. The attacks were thenrenewed, and continued until midnight, when they ceased, until thethird hour of the day following. The Aetolians imagined that theRomans suspended the attack from the same cause by which they feltthemselves distressed,--excessive fatigue. As soon, therefore, asthe signal of retreat was given to the Romans, as if themselves werethereby recalled from duty, every one gladly retired from his post,nor did they again appear in arms on the walls before the third hourof the day."Book 36,Chapter 24,"The consul having put a stop to the assault at midnight, renewedit on three of the sides, at the fourth watch, with the utmost vigour;ordering Tiberius Sempronius, on the fourth, to keep his party alert,and ready to obey his signal; for he concluded assuredly, that in thetumult by night the enemy would all run to those quarters whence theshouting was heard. Of the Aetolians, such as had gone to rest, withdifficulty roused their bodies from sleep, exhausted as they were withfatigue and watching; and such as were still awake, ran in the darkto the places where they heard the noise of fighting. Meanwhile theRomans endeavoured some to climb over the ruins of the walls, throughthe breaches; others, to scale the walls with ladders; while theAetolians hastened in all directions to defend the parts attacked.In one quarter, where the buildings stood outside the city, therewas neither attack nor defence. A party stood ready, waiting for thesignal to make an attack, but there was none within to oppose them.The day now began to dawn, and the consul gave the signal; on whichthe party, without any opposition, made their way into the town; somethrough parts that had been battered, others scaling the walls wherethey were entire. As soon as the Aetolians heard them raise the shout,which denoted the place being taken, they every where forsook theirposts, and fled into the citadel. The victors sacked the city;the consul having given permission, not for the sake of gratifyingresentment or animosity, but that the soldiers, after having beenrestrained from plunder in so many cities captured from the enemy,might at last, in some one place, enjoy the fruits of victory. Aboutmid-day he recalled the troops, and dividing them into two parts,ordered one to be led round by the foot of the mountain to a rock,which was of equal height with the citadel, and seemed as if it hadbeen broken off from it, leaving a hollow between; but the summits ofthese eminences are so nearly contiguous that weapons may be throwninto the citadel from the top of the other. With the other half of thetroops the consul intended to march, up from the city to the citadel,and waited to receive a signal from those who were to mount the rockon the farther side. The Aetolians in the citadel could not supportthe shout of the party which had seized the rock, and the consequentattack of the Romans from the city; for their courage was now broken,and the place was by no means in a condition to hold out a siegeof any continuance; the women, children, and great numbers of otherhelpless people, being crowded together in a fort, which was scarcecapable of containing, much less of affording protection to such amultitude. On the first assault, therefore, they laid down theirarms and submitted. Among the rest was delivered up Damocritus, chiefmagistrate of the Aetolians, who at the beginning of the war, whenTitus Quinctius asked for a copy of the decree passed by the Aetoliansfor inviting Antiochus, told him, that, ""in Italy, when the Aetolianswere encamped there, it should be delivered to him."" On account ofthis presumptuous insolence of his, his surrender was a matter ofgreater satisfaction to the victors."Book 36,Chapter 25,"At the same time, while the Romans were employed in the reductionof Heraclea, Philip, by concert, besieged Lamia. He had an interviewwith the consul, as he was returning from Boeotia, at Thermopylae,whither he came to congratulate him and the Roman people on theirsuccesses, and to apologize for his not having taken an active part inthe war, being prevented by sickness; and then they went from thence,by different routes, to lay siege to the two cities at once. Thedistance between these places is about seven miles; and as Lamiastands on high ground, and has an open prospect, particularly towardsthe region of Mount Oeta, the distance seems very short, and everything that passes can be seen from thence. The Romans and Macedonians,with all the emulation of competitors for a prize, employed the utmostexertions, both night and day, either in the works or in fighting; butthe Macedonians encountered greater difficulty on this account, thatthe Romans made their approaches by mounds, covered galleries, andother works, which were all above ground; whereas the Macedoniansworked under ground by mines, and, in that stony soil, often met aflinty rock, which iron could not penetrate. The king, seeing that hisundertaking succeeded but ill, endeavoured, by conversations with theprincipal inhabitants, to prevail on the townspeople to surrender theplace; for he was fully persuaded, that if Heraclea should be takenfirst, the Lamians would then choose to surrender to the Romans ratherthan to him; and that the consul would take to himself the merit ofrelieving them from a siege. Nor was he mistaken in that opinion; forno sooner was Heraclea reduced, than a message came to him to desistfrom the assault; because ""it was more reasonable that the Romansoldiers, who had fought the Aetolians in the field, should reap thefruits of the victory."" Thus was Lamia relieved, and the misfortune ofa neighbouring city proved the means of its escaping a like disaster."Book 36,Chapter 26,"A few days before the capture of Heraclea, the Aetolians, havingassembled a council at Hypata, sent ambassadors to Antiochus, amongwhom was Thoas, the same who had been sent on the former occasion.Their instructions were in the first place, to request the king againto assemble his land and marine forces and cross over into Greece;and, in the next place, if any circumstance should detain him, then tosend them supplies of men and money. They were to remind him, that ""itconcerned his dignity and his honour, not to abandon his allies; andit likewise concerned the safety of his kingdom, not to leave theRomans at full leisure, after ruining the nation of the Aetolians,to carry their whole force into Asia."" What they said was true, andtherefore made the deeper impression on the king; in consequenceof which, he immediately supplied the ambassadors with the moneyrequisite for the exigencies of the war, and assured them, thathe would send them succours both of troops and ships. One of theambassadors, namely, Thoas, he kept with him, by no means against hiswill, as he hoped that, being present, he might induce the performanceof the king's promises."Book 36,Chapter 27,"But the loss of Heraclea entirely broke the spirits of theAetolians; insomuch that, within a few days after they had sentambassadors into Asia for the purpose of renewing the war, andinviting the king, they threw aside all warlike designs, anddespatched deputies to the consul to sue for peace. When these beganto speak, the consul, interrupting them, said, that he had otherbusiness to attend to at present; and, ordering them to return toHypata, granted them a truce for ten days, sending with them LuciusValerius Flaccus, to whom, he desired, whatever business they intendedto have proposed to himself might be communicated, with any other thatthey thought proper. On their arrival at Hypata, the chiefs of theAetolians held a consultation, at which Flaccus was present, onthe method to be used in treating with the consul. They showed aninclination to begin with addressing themselves wholly to the ancienttreaties, and the services which they had performed to the Romanpeople; on which Flaccus desired them to ""speak no more of treaties,which they themselves had violated and annulled."" He told them, that""they might expect more advantage from an acknowledgment of theirfault, and entreaty. For their hopes of safety rested not on themerits of their cause, but on the clemency of the Roman people. That,if they acted in a suppliant manner, he would himself be a solicitorin their favour, both with the consul and with the senate at Rome;for thither also they must send ambassadors."" This appeared to all theonly way to safety: ""to submit themselves entirely to the faith of theRomans. For, in that case, the latter would be ashamed to do injury tosuppliants; while themselves would, nevertheless, retain the powerof consulting their own interest, should fortune offer any thing moreadvantageous."""Book 36,Chapter 28,"When they came into the consul's presence, Phaeneas, who was atthe head of the embassy, made a long speech, designed to mitigate thewrath of the conqueror by various considerations; and he concludedwith saying, that ""the Aetolians surrendered themselves, and allbelonging to them, to the faith of the Roman people."" The consul, onhearing this, said, ""Aetolians, consider well whether you will yieldon these terms:"" and then Phaeneas produced the decree, in which theconditions were expressly mentioned. ""Since then,"" said the consul,""you submit in this manner, I demand that, without delay, you deliverup to me Dicaearchus your countryman, Menetas the Epirot,"" who had,with an armed force, entered Naupactum, and compelled the inhabitantsto defection; ""and also Amynander, with the Athamanian chiefs, bywhose advice you revolted from us."" Phaeneas, almost interrupting theRoman while he was speaking, answered,--""We surrendered ourselves, notinto slavery, but to your faith; and I take it for granted, that, fromnot being sufficiently acquainted with us, you fall into the mistakeof commanding what is inconsistent with the practice of the Greeks.""""Nor in truth,"" replied the consul, ""do I much concern myself, atpresent, what the Aetolians may think conformable to the practiceof the Greeks; while I, conformably to the practice of the Romans,exercise authority over men, who just now surrendered themselves bya decree of their own, and were, before that, conquered by my arms.Wherefore, unless my commands are quickly complied with, I orderthat you be put in chains."" At the same time he ordered chains tobe brought forth, and the lictors to surround the ambassadors. Thiseffectually subdued the arrogance of Phaeneas and the other Aetolians;and, at length, they became sensible of their situation. Phaeneas thensaid, that ""as to himself and his countrymen there present, they knewthat his commands must be obeyed: but it was necessary that a councilof the Aetolians should meet, to pass decrees accordingly; and that,for that purpose, he requested a suspension of arms for ten days.""At the intercession of Flaccus on behalf of the Aetolians, this wasgranted, and they returned to Hypata. When Phaeneas related here,in the select council, called Apocleti, the orders which they hadreceived, and the treatment which they had narrowly escaped; althoughthe chiefs bemoaned their condition, nevertheless they were ofopinion, that the conqueror must be obeyed, and that the Aetoliansshould be summoned, from all their towns, to a general assembly."Book 36,Chapter 29,"But when the assembled multitude heard the same account, theirminds were so highly exasperated, both by the harshness of the orderand the indignity offered, that, even if they had been in a pacifictemper before, the violent impulse of anger which they then felt wouldhave been sufficient to rouse them to war. Their rage was increasedalso by the difficulty of executing what was enjoined on them; for,""how was it possible for them, for instance, to deliver up kingAmynander?"" It happened, also, that a favourable prospect seemed toopen to them; for Nicander, returning from king Antiochus at thatjuncture, filled the minds of the people with unfounded assurances,that immense preparations for war were going on both by land and sea.This man, after finishing the business of his embassy, set out on hisreturn to Aetolia; and on the twelfth day after he embarked, reachedPhalara, on the Malian bay. Having conveyed thence to Lamia the moneythat he had brought, he, with a few light troops, directed, in theevening, his course toward Hypata, by known paths, through the countrywhich lay between the Roman and Macedonian camps. Here he fell in withan advanced guard of the Macedonians, and was conducted to the king,whose dinner guests had not yet separated. Philip, being told of hiscoming, received him as a guest, not an enemy; desired him to take aseat, and join the entertainment; and afterwards, when he dismissedthe rest, detained him alone, and told him, that he had nothing tofear for himself. He censured severely the conduct of the Aetolians,in bringing, first the Romans, and afterwards Antiochus, into Greece;designs which originated in a want of judgment, and always recoiledon their own heads. But ""he would forget,"" he said, ""all pasttransactions, which it was easier to blame than to amend; nor would heact in such a manner as to appear to insult their misfortunes. On theother hand, it would become the Aetolians to lay aside, at length,their animosity towards him; and it would become Nicander himself,in his private capacity, to remember that day, on which he had beenpreserved by him."" Having then appointed persons to escort him to aplace of safety, Nicander arrived at Hypata, while his countrymen wereconsulting about the peace with Rome."Book 36,Chapter 30,"Manius Acilius having sold, or given to the soldiers, the bootyfound near Heraclea, and having learned that the counsels adoptedat Hypata were not of a pacific nature, but that the Aetolians hadhastily assembled at Naupactum, with intention to make a stand thereagainst the whole brunt of the war, sent forward Appius Claudius, withfour thousand men, to seize the heights of the mountains, where thepasses were difficult; and he himself, ascending Mount Oeta, offeredsacrifices to Hercules, in the spot called Pyra,[1] because there themortal part of the demi-god was burned. He then set out with the mainbody of the army, and marched all the rest of the way with tolerableease and expedition. But when they came to Corax, a very high mountainbetween Callipolis and Naupactum, great numbers of the beasts ofburden, together with their loads, tumbled down the precipices, andmany of the men were hurt. This clearly showed with how negligent anenemy they had to do, who had not secured so difficult a pass by aguard, and so blocked up the passage; for, even as the case was, thearmy suffered considerably. Hence he marched down to Naupactum; andhaving erected a fort against the citadel, he invested the other partsof the city, dividing his forces according to the situation of thewalls. Nor was the siege likely to prove less difficult and laboriousthan that of Heraclea."Book 36,Chapter 31,"At the same time, the Achaeans laid siege to Messene, inPeloponnesus, because it refused to become a member of their body: forthe two states of Messene and Elis were unconnected with the Achaeanconfederacy, and sympathized with the Aetolians. However, the Eleans,after Antiochus had been driven out of Greece, answered the deputies,sent by the Achaeans, with more moderation: that ""when the king'stroops were removed, they would consider what part they should take.""But the Messenians had dismissed the deputies without an answer, andprepared for war. Alarmed, afterwards, at their own situation,when they saw the enemy ravaging their country without control,and pitching their camp close to their city, they sent deputies toChalcis, to Titus Quinctius, the author of their liberty, to acquainthim, that ""the Messenians were willing, both to open their gates,and surrender their city, to the Romans, but not to the Achaeans.""On hearing this Quinctius immediately set out, and despatched fromMegalopolis a messenger to Diophanes, praetor of the Achaeans,requiring him to draw off his army instantly from Messene, and to cometo him. Diophanes obeyed the order; raising the siege, he hastenedforward himself before the army, and met Quinctius near Andania, asmall town between Megalopolis and Messene. When he began to explainthe reasons for commencing the siege, Quinctius, gently reproving himfor undertaking a business of that importance without consulting him,ordered him to disband his forces, and not to disturb a peacewhich had been established advantageously to all. He commanded theMessenians to recall the exiles, and to unite themselves to theconfederacy of the Achaeans; and if there were any particulars towhich they chose to object, or any precautions which they judgedrequisite for the future, they might apply to him at Corinth. He thengave directions to Diophanes, to convene immediately a general councilof the Achaeans, that he might settle some business with them."Book 36,Chapter 32,"In this assembly he complained of their having acquired possessionof the island of Zacynthus by unfair means, and demanded that itshould be restored to the Romans. Zacynthus had formerly belonged toPhilip, king of Macedonia, and he had made it over to Amynander, oncondition of his giving him leave to march an army through Athamania,into the upper part of Aetolia, on that expedition wherein hecompelled the Aetolians with dejected spirits to sue for peace.Amynander gave the government of the island to Philip, theMegalopolitan; and afterwards, during the war in which he unitedhimself with Antiochus against the Romans, having called out Philip tothe duties of the campaign, he sent, as his successor, Hierocles, ofAgrigentum. This man, after the flight of Antiochus from Thermopylae,and the expulsion of Amynander from Athamania by Philip, sentemissaries of his own accord to Diophanes, praetor of the Achaeans;and having bargained for a sum of money, delivered over the islandto the Achaeans. This acquisition, made during the war, the Romansclaimed as their own; for they said, that ""it was not for Diophanesand the Achaeans that the consul Manius Acilius, and the Romanlegions, fought at Thermopylae."" Diophanes, in answer, sometimesapologized for himself and his nation; sometimes insisted on thejustice of the proceeding. But several of the Achaeans testified thatthey had, from the beginning, disapproved of that business, and theynow blamed the obstinacy of the praetor. Pursuant to their advice,a decree was made, that the affair should be left entirely to thedisposal of Titus Quinctius. As Quinctius was severe to such as madeopposition, so, when complied with, he was easily appeased. Layingaside, therefore, every thing stern in his voice and looks, hesaid,--""If, Achaeans, I thought the possession of that islandadvantageous to you, I would be the first to advise the senate andpeople of Rome to permit you to hold it. But as I see that a tortoise,when collected within its natural covering, is safe against blowsof any kind, and whenever it thrusts out any of its limbs, it feelswhatever it has thus uncovered, weak and liable to every injury: soyou, in like manner, Achaeans, being enclosed on all sides by the sea,can easily unite among yourselves, and maintain by that union allthat is comprehended within the limits of Peloponnesus; but whenever,through ambition of enlarging your possessions, you overstep theselimits, then all that you hold beyond them is naked, and exposedto every attack."" The whole assembly declaring their assent, andDiophanes not daring to give further opposition, Zacynthus was cededto the Romans."Book 36,Chapter 33,"When the consul was on his march to Naupactum, king Philipproposed, that, if it was agreeable to him, he would, in the meantime, retake those cities that had revolted from their alliancewith Rome. Having obtained permission so to do, he, about this time,marched his army to Demetrias, being well aware that great distractionprevailed there; for the garrison, being destitute of all hope ofsuccour since they were abandoned by Antiochus, and having no relianceon the Aetolians, daily and nightly expected the arrival of Philipor the Romans, whom they had most reason to dread, as these were mostjustly incensed against them. There was, in the place, an irregularmultitude of the king's soldiers, a few of whom had been at first leftthere as a garrison, but the greater part had fled thither after thedefeat of his army, most of them without arms, and without eitherstrength or courage sufficient to sustain a siege. Wherefore onPhilip's sending on messengers, to offer them hopes of pardon beingobtainable, they answered, that their gates were open for the king.On his first entrance, several of the chiefs left the city; Eurylochuskilled himself. The soldiers of Antiochus, in conformity to astipulation, were escorted, through Macedonia and Thrace, by a bodyof Macedonians, and conducted to Lysimachia. There were, also, a fewships at Demetrias, under the command of Isidorus, which, togetherwith their commander, were dismissed. Philip then reduced Dolopia,Aperantia, and several cities of Perrhaebia."Book 36,Chapter 34,"While Philip was thus employed, Titus Quinctius, after receivingfrom the Achaean council the cession of Zacynthus, crossed over toNaupactum, which had stood a siege of near two months, but was nowreduced to a desperate condition; and it was supposed, that if itshould be taken by storm, the whole nation of the Aetolians would besunk thereby in utter destruction. But, although he was deservedlyincensed against the Aetolians, from the recollection that they alonehad attempted to depreciate his merits, when he was giving liberty toGreece; and had been in no degree influenced by his advice, whenhe endeavoured, by forewarning them of the events, which had sinceoccurred, to deter them from their mad undertaking: nevertheless,thinking it particularly his business to take care that none ofthe states of Greece which had been liberated by himself should beentirely subverted, he first walked about near the walls, that hemight be easily known by the Aetolians. He was quickly distinguishedby the first advanced guards, and the news spread from rank to rankthat Quinctius was there. On this, the people from all sides ran tothe walls, and eagerly stretching out their hands, all in one jointcry besought Quinctius by name, to assist and save them. Although hewas much affected by these entreaties, yet for that time he madesigns with his hands, that they were to expect no assistance fromhim. However, when he met the consul he accosted him thus:--""ManiusAcilius, are you unapprized of what is passing; or do you know it,and think it immaterial to the interest of the commonwealth?"" Thisinflamed the consul with curiosity, and he replied, ""But explain whatis your meaning."" Quinctius then said,--""Do you not see that, sincethe defeat of Antiochus, you have been wasting time in besieging twocities, though the year of your command is near expiring; but thatPhilip, who never faced the enemy, or even saw their standards, hasannexed to his dominions such a number, not only of cities, but ofnations,--Athamania, Perrhaebia, Aperantia, Dolopia? But, surely, weare not so deeply interested in diminishing the strength and resourcesof the Aetolians, as in hindering those of Philip from being augmentedbeyond measure; and in you, and your soldiers, not having yet gained,to reward your victory, as many towns as Philip has gained Grecianstates."""Book 36,Chapter 35,"The consul assented to these remarks, but a feeling of shamesuggested itself to him--if he should abandon the siege with hispurpose unaccomplished. At length the matter was left entirely to themanagement of Quinctius. He went again to that part of the wallwhence the Aetolians had called to him a little before; and on theirentreating him now, with still greater earnestness, to take compassionon the nation of the Aetolians, he desired that some of them mightcome out to him. Accordingly, Phaeneas himself, with some others ofthe principal men, instantly came and threw themselves at his feet. Hethen said,--""Your condition causes me to restrain my resentment and myreproofs. The events which I foretold have come to pass, and you havenot even this reflection left you, that they have fallen upon youundeservedly. Nevertheless, since fate has, in some manner, destinedme to the office of cherishing the interests of Greece, I will notcease to show kindness even to the unthankful. Send intercessors tothe consul, and let them petition him for a suspension of hostilities,for so long a time as will allow you to send ambassadors to Rome, tosurrender yourselves to the will of the senate. I will intercede, andplead in your favour with the consul."" They did as Quinctius directed;nor did the consul reject their application. He granted them a trucefor a certain time, until the embassy might bring a reply from Rome;and then, raising the siege, he sent his army into Phocis. The consul,with Titus Quinctius, crossed over thence to Aegium, to confer withthe council of the Achaeans about the Eleans, and also the restorationof the Lacedaemonian exiles. But neither was carried into execution,because the Achaeans chose to reserve to themselves the merit ofeffecting the latter; and the Eleans preferred being united to theAchaean confederacy by a voluntary act of their own, rather thanthrough the mediation of the Romans. Ambassadors came hither to theconsul from the Epirots, who, it was well known, had not with honestfidelity maintained the alliance. Although they had not furnishedAntiochus with any soldiers, yet they were charged with havingassisted him with money; and they themselves did not disavow havingsent ambassadors to him. They requested that they might be permittedto continue on the former footing of friendship. To which the consulanswered, that ""he did not yet know whether he was to consider them asfriends or foes. The senate must be the judge of that matter. He wouldtherefore take no step in the business, but leave it to be determinedat Rome; and for that purpose he granted them a truce of ninety days.""When the Epirots, who were sent to Rome, addressed the senate, theyrather enumerated hostile acts which they had not committed, thancleared themselves of those laid to their charge; and they receivedsuch an answer that they seemed rather to have obtained pardon thanproved their innocence. About the same time ambassadors fromking Philip were introduced to the senate, and presented hiscongratulations on their late successes. They asked leave to sacrificein the Capitol, and to deposit an offering of gold in the temple ofJupiter supremely good and great. This was granted by the senate, andthey presented a golden crown of a hundred pounds' weight. Thesenate not only answered the ambassadors with kindness, but gavethem Demetrius, Philip's son, who was at Rome as an hostage, to beconducted home to his father.--Such was the conclusion of the warwaged in Greece by the consul Manius Acilius against Antiochus."Book 36,Chapter 36,"The other consul, Publius Cornelius Scipio, who had obtained bylot the province of Gaul, before he set out to the war which was tobe waged against the Boians, demanded of the senate, by a decree, toorder him money for the exhibition of games, which, when acting aspropraetor in Spain, he had vowed at a critical time of a battle. Hisdemand was deemed unprecedented and unreasonable, and they thereforevoted, that ""whatever games he had vowed, on his own single judgment,without consulting the senate, he should celebrate out of thespoils, if he had reserved any for the purpose; otherwise, at his ownexpense."" Accordingly, Publius Cornelius exhibited those games throughthe space of ten days. About this time the temple of the great IdaeanMother was dedicated; which deity, on her being brought from Asia,in the consulate of Publius Cornelius Scipio, afterwards surnamedAfricanus, and Publius Lucinius, the above-mentioned Publius Corneliushad conducted from the sea-side to the Palatine. In pursuance of adecree of the senate, Marcus Livius and Caius Claudius, censors,in the consulate of Marcus Cornelius and Publius Sempronius, hadcontracted for the erection of the goddess's temple; and thirteenyears after it had been so contracted for, it was dedicated byMarcus Junius Brutus, and games were celebrated on occasion of itsdedication: in which, according to the account of Valerius Antias,dramatic entertainments were, for the first time, introduced into theMegalesian games. Likewise, Caius Licinius Lucullus, being appointedduumvir, dedicated the temple of Youth in the great circus. Thistemple had been vowed sixteen years before by Marcus Livius, consul,on the day wherein he cut off Hasdrubal and his army; and the sameperson, when censor, in the consulate of Marcus Cornelius and PubliusSempronius, had contracted for the building of it. Games were alsoexhibited on occasion of this consecration, and every thing wasperformed with the greater degree of religious zeal, on account of theimpending war with Antiochus."Book 36,Chapter 37,"At the beginning of the year in which those transactions passed,after Manius Acilius had gone to open the campaign, and while theother consul, Publius Cornelius, yet remained in Rome, two tame oxen,it is said, climbed up by ladders on the tiles of a house in theCarina. The aruspices ordered them to be burned alive, and their ashesto be thrown into the Tiber. It was reported, that several showers ofstones had fallen at Tarracina and Amiternum; that, at Minturnae,the temple of Jupiter, and the shops round the forum, were struck bylightning; that, at Vulturnum, in the mouth of the river, two shipswere struck by lightning, and burnt to ashes. On occasion of theseprodigies, the decemvirs, being ordered by a decree of the senateto consult the Sibylline books, declared, that ""a fast ought to beinstituted in honour of Ceres, and the same observed every fifth year;that the nine days' worship ought to be solemnized, and a supplicationfor one day; and that they should observe the supplication, withgarlands on their heads; also that the consul Publius Cornelius shouldsacrifice to such deities, and with such victims, as the decemvirsshould direct."" When he had used every means to avert the wrath of thegods, by duly fulfilling vows and expiating prodigies, the consulwent to his province; and, ordering the proconsul Cneius Domitius todisband his army, and go home to Rome, he marched his own legions intothe territory of the Boians."Book 36,Chapter 38,"Nearly at the same time, the Ligurians, having collected an armyunder the sanction of their devoting law, made an unexpected attack,in the night, on the camp of the proconsul Quintus Minucius. Minuciuskept his troops, until daylight, drawn up within the rampart,and watchful to prevent the enemy from scaling any part of thefortifications At the first light, he made a sally by two gates atonce: but the Ligurians did not, as he had expected, give way to hisfirst onset; on the contrary, they maintained a dubious contest formore than two hours. At last, as other and still other troops came outfrom the camp, and fresh men took the place of those who were weariedin the fight, the Ligurians, who besides other hardships, felt a greatloss of strength from the want of sleep, betook themselves to flight.Above four thousand of the enemy were killed; the Romans and allieslost not quite three hundred. About two months after this, the consulPublius Cornelius fought a pitched battle with the army of the Boianswith extraordinary success. Valerius Antias affirms, that twenty-eightthousand of the enemy were slain, and three thousand four hundredtaken, with a hundred and twenty-four military standards, one thousandtwo hundred and thirty horses, and two hundred and forty-sevenwaggons; and that of the conquerors there fell one thousand fourhundred and eighty-four. Though we may not entirely credit this writerwith respect to the numbers, as in such exaggeration no writer is moreextravagant, yet it is certain that the victory on this occasion wasvery complete; because the enemy's camp was taken, while, immediatelyafter the battle, the Boians surrendered themselves; and because asupplication was decreed by the senate on account of it, and victimsof the greater kinds were sacrificed. About the same time MarcusFulvius Nobilior entered the city in ovation, returning from FartherSpain. He carried with him twelve thousand pounds of silver, onehundred and thirty thousand silver denarii, and one hundred andtwenty-seven pounds of gold."Book 36,Chapter 39,"The consul, Publius Cornelius, having received hostages from theBoians, punished them so far as to appropriate almost one-half oftheir lands for the use of the Roman people, and into which they mightafterwards, if they chose, send colonies. Then returning home in fullconfidence of a triumph, he dismissed his troops, and ordered themto attend on the day of his triumph at Rome. The next day after hisarrival, he held a meeting of the senate, in the temple of Bellona,when he detailed to them the services he had performed, and demandedto ride through the city in triumph. Publius Sempronius Blaesus,tribune of the people, advised, that ""the honour of a triumph shouldnot be refused to Scipio, but postponed. Wars of the Ligurians,"" hesaid, ""were always united with wars of the Gauls; for these nations,lying so near, sent mutual assistance to each other. If PubliusScipio, after subduing the Boians in battle, had either gone himself,with his victorious army, into the country of the Ligurians, or senta part of his forces to Quintus Minucius, who was detained there,now the third year, by a war which was still undecided, that with theLigurians might have been brought to an end: instead of which, he had,in order to procure a full attendance on his triumph, brought home thetroops, who might have performed most material services to the state;and might do so still, if the senate thought proper, by deferring thistoken of victory, to redeem that which had been omitted through eagerhaste for a triumph. If they would order the consul to return with hislegions into his province, and to give his assistance towards subduingthe Ligurians, (for, unless these were reduced under the dominion andjurisdiction of the Roman people, neither would the Boians everremain quiet,) there must be either peace or war with both. Whenthe Ligurians should be subdued, Publius Cornelius, in quality ofproconsul, might triumph, a few months later, after the precedent ofmany, who did not attain that honour until the expiration of theiroffice."""Book 36,Chapter 40,"To this the consul answered, that ""neither had the province ofLiguria fallen to his lot, nor had he waged war with the Ligurians,nor did he demand a triumph over them. He confidently hoped, that ina short time Quintus Minucius, after completing their reduction, woulddemand and obtain a well-deserved triumph. For his part, he demanded atriumph over the Boian Gauls, whom he had conquered in battle and haddriven out of their camp; of whose whole nation he had received anabsolute submission within two days after the fight; and from whomhe had brought home hostages to secure peace in future. But therewas another circumstance, of much greater magnitude: he had slain inbattle so great a number of Gauls, that no commander, before him, evermet in the field so many thousands, at least of the Boians. Out offifty thousand men, more than one-half were killed, and many thousandsmade prisoners; so that the Boians had now remaining only old menand boys. Could it, then, be a matter of surprise to any one, that avictorious army, which had not left one enemy in the province, shouldcome to Rome to attend the triumph of their consul? And if the senateshould choose to employ the services of these troops in anotherprovince also, which of the two kinds of treatment could it besupposed would make them enter on a new course of danger and anotherlaborious enterprise with the greater alacrity; the paying them thereward of their former toils and dangers without defalcation; or, thesending them away, with the prospect, instead of the reality, whenthey had once been disappointed in their first expectation? As towhat concerned himself personally, he had acquired a stock of glorysufficient for his whole life, on that day, when the senate adjudgedhim to be the best man (in the state), and commissioned him to give areception to the Idaean Mother. With this inscription (though neitherconsulship nor triumph were added) the statue of Publius Scipio Nasicawould be sufficiently honoured and dignified."" The unanimous senatenot only gave their vote for the triumph, but by their influenceprevailed on the tribune to desist from his protest. PubliusCornelius, the consul, triumphed over the Boians. In this processionhe carried, on Gallic waggons, arms, standards, and spoils of allsorts; the brazen utensils of the Gauls; and, together with theprisoners of distinction, he led a train of captured horses. Hedeposited in the treasury a thousand four hundred and seventy goldenchains; and besides these, two hundred and forty-five pounds' weightof gold; two thousand three hundred and forty pounds' weight ofsilver, some unwrought, and some formed in vessels of the Gallicfashion, not without beauty; and two hundred and thirty-four thousanddenarii.[1] To the soldiers who followed his chariot, he distributedthree hundred and twenty-five _asses_[2] each, double to a centurion,triple to a horseman. Next day, he summoned an assembly, and afterexpatiating on his own services, and the ill-treatment shown him bythe tribune who wanted to entangle him in a way which did not belongto him, in order to defraud him of the fruits of his success, heabsolved the soldiers of their oath and discharged them."Book 36,Chapter 41,"While this passed in Italy, Antiochus was at Ephesus divested ofall concern respecting the war with Rome, as supposing that the Romanshad no intention of coming into Asia; which state of security wasoccasioned by the erroneous opinions or the flattering representationsof the greater part of his friends. Hannibal alone, whose judgmentwas, at that time, the most highly respected by the king, declared,that ""he rather wondered the Romans were not already in Asia thanentertained a doubt of their coming. The passage was easier fromGreece to Asia, than from Italy to Greece, and Antiochus constituted amuch more important object than the Aetolians. For the Roman arms werenot less powerful on sea than on land. Their fleet had long beenat Malea, and he had heard that a reinforcement of ships and a newcommander had lately come from Italy, with intent to enter on action.He therefore advised Antiochus not to form to himself vain hopes ofpeace. He must necessarily in a short time maintain a contest with theRomans both by sea and land, in Asia, and for Asia itself; and musteither wrest the power from those who grasped at the empire of theworld, or lose his own dominions."" He seemed to be the only person whocould foresee, and honestly foretell, what was to happen. The king,therefore, with the ships which were equipped and in readiness, sailedto the Chersonesus, in order to strengthen the places there withgarrisons, lest the Romans should happen to come by land. He leftorders with Polyxenidas to fit out the rest of the fleet, and putto sea; and sent out advice-boats among the islands to procureintelligence of every thing that was passing."Book 36,Chapter 42,"When Caius Livius, commander of the Roman fleet, sailed with fiftydecked ships from Rome, he went to Neapolis, where he had appointedthe rendezvous of the undecked ships, which were due by treaty fromthe allies on that coast; and thence he proceeded to Sicily, where,as he sailed through the strait beyond Messana, he was joined by sixCarthaginian ships, sent to his assistance; and then, having collectedthe vessels due from the Rhegians, Locrians, and other allies, whowere bound by the same conditions, he purified the fleet at Lacinium,and put forth into the open sea. On his arrival at Corcyra, which wasthe first Grecian country where he touched, inquiring about the stateof the war, (for all matters in Greece were not yet entirely settled,)and about the Roman fleet, he was told, that the consul and the kingwere posted at the pass of Thermopylae, and that the fleet lay atPiraeus: on which, judging expedition necessary on every account, hesailed directly forward to Peloponnesus. Having on his passage ravagedSamos and Zacynthus, because they favoured the party of the Aetolians,he bent his course to Malea; and, meeting very favourable weather,arrived in a few days at Piraeus, where he joined the old fleet. AtScyllaeum he was met by king Eumenes, with three ships, who hadlong hesitated at Aegina whether he should go home to defend his ownkingdom, on hearing that Antiochus was preparing both marine and landforces at Ephesus; or whether he should unite himself inseparably tothe Romans, on whose destiny his own depended. Aulus Atilius, havingdelivered to his successor twenty-five decked ships, sailed fromPiraeus for Rome. Livius, with eighty-one beaked ships, besides manyothers of inferior rates, some of which were open and furnished withbeaks, others without beaks, fit for advice-boats, crossed over toDelos."Book 36,Chapter 43,"At this time, the consul Acilius was engaged in the siege ofNaupactum. Livius was detained several days at Delos by contrarywinds, for that tract among the Cyclades, which are separated in someplaces by larger straits, in others by smaller, is extremely subjectto storms. Polyxenidas, receiving intelligence from his scout-ships,which were stationed in various places, that the Roman fleet lay atDelos, sent off an express to the king, who, quitting the businessin which he was employed in Hellespontus, and taking with him allthe ships of war, returned to Ephesus with all possible speed, andinstantly called a council to determine whether he should risk anengagement at sea. Polyxenidas affirmed, that no delay should beincurred; ""it was particularly requisite so to do, before the fleet ofEumenes and the Rhodian ships should join the Romans; in which case,even, they would scarcely be inferior in number, and in every otherparticular would have a great superiority, by reason of the agility oftheir vessels, and a variety of auxiliary circumstances. For the Romanships, being unskilfully constructed, were slow in their motions; and,besides that, as they were coming to an enemy's coast, they would beheavily laden with provisions; whereas their own, leaving none butfriends in all the countries round, would have nothing on boardbut men and arms. Moreover that their knowledge of the sea, of theadjacent lands, and of the winds, would be greatly in their favour;of all which the Romans being ignorant, would find themselves muchdistressed."" In advising this plan he influenced all, especiallyas the same person who gave the advice was also to carry it intoexecution. Two days only were passed in making preparations; and onthe third, setting sail with a hundred ships, of which seventy haddecks, and the rest were open, but all of the smaller rates, theysteered their course to Phocaea. The king, as he did not intend tobe present in the naval combat, on hearing that the Roman fleet wasapproaching, withdrew to Magnesia, near Sipylus, to collect his landforces, while his ships proceeded to Cyssus, a port of Erythraea,where it was supposed they might with more convenience wait for theenemy. The Romans, as soon as the north wind, which had held forseveral days, ceased, sailed from Delos to Phanae, a port in Chios,opposite the Aegaean sea. They afterwards brought round the fleet tothe city of Chios, and having taken in provisions there, sailed overto Phocaea. Eumenes, who had gone to join his fleet at Elaea, returneda few days after, with twenty-four decked ships, and a greater numberof open ones, to Phocaea, where were the Romans, who were fitting andpreparing themselves for a sea-fight. Then setting sail with a hundredand five decked ships, and about fifty open ones, they were for sometime driven forcibly towards the land, by a north wind blowing acrossits course. The ships were thereby obliged to go, for the most part,singly, one after another, in a thin line; afterwards, when theviolence of the wind abated, they endeavoured to stretch over to theharbour of Corycus, beyond Cyssus."Book 36,Chapter 44,"When intelligence was brought to Polyxenidas that the enemy wereapproaching, he rejoiced at an opportunity of engaging them, and drewout the left squadron towards the open sea, at the same time orderingthe commanders of the ships to extend the right division towards theland; and then advanced to the fight, with his fleet in a regularline of battle. The Roman commander, on seeing this, furled his sails,lowered his masts, and, at the same time adjusting his rigging, waitedfor the ships which were coming up. There were now about thirty in theline; and in order that his left squadron might form a front in likedirection, he hoisted his top-sails, and stretched out into the deep,ordering the others to push forward, between him and the land, againstthe right squadron of the enemy. Eumenes brought up the rear; who, assoon as he saw the bustle of taking down the rigging begin, likewisebrought up his ships with all possible speed. All their ships were bythis time in sight; two Carthaginian vessels, however, which advancedbefore the Romans, came across three belonging to the king. As thenumbers were unequal, two of the king's ships fell upon one, and, inthe first place, swept away the oars from both its sides; the armedmariners then boarded, and killing some of its defenders and throwingothers into the sea, took the ship. The one which had engaged in anequal contest, on seeing her companion taken, before she could besurrounded by the three, fled back to the fleet. Livius, fired withindignation, bore down with the praetorian ship against the enemy. Thetwo which had overpowered the Carthaginian ship, in hopes of the samesuccess against this one, advanced to the attack, on which he orderedthe rowers on both sides to plunge their oars in the water, in orderto hold the ship steady, and to throw grappling-irons into the enemy'svessels as they came up. Having, by these means, rendered the businesssomething like a fight on land, he desired his men to bear in mindthe courage of Romans, and not to regard the slaves of a king as men.Accordingly, this single ship now defeated and captured the two, withmore ease than the two had before taken one. By this time the entirefleets were engaged and intermixed with each other. Eumenes, who hadcome up last, and after the battle was begun, when he saw the leftsquadron of the enemy thrown into disorder by Livius, directed his ownattack against their right, where the contest was yet equal."Book 36,Chapter 45,"In a short time a flight commenced, in the first instance, withthe left squadron: for Polyxenidas, perceiving that he was evidentlyovermatched with respect to the bravery of the men, hoisted histop-sails, and betook himself to flight; and, quickly after, those whohad engaged with Eumenes near the land did the same. The Romans andEumenes pursued with much perseverance, as long as the rowers wereable to hold out, and they had any prospect of annoying the rear ofthe enemy; but finding that the latter, by reason of the lightness andfleetness of their ships, baffled every effort that could be made bytheirs, loaded as they were with provisions, they at length desisted,having taken thirteen ships together with the soldiers and rowers, andsunk ten. Of the Roman fleet, only the one Carthaginian ship, which,at the beginning of the action, had been attacked by two, was lost.Polyxenidas continued his flight, until he got into the harbour ofEphesus. The Romans staid, during the remainder of that day, inthe port from which the king's fleet had sailed out, and on the dayfollowing proceeded in the pursuit. In the midst of their course theywere met by twenty-five Rhodian decked ships, under Pausistratus, thecommander of the fleet, and in conjunction with these followed therunaways to Ephesus, where they stood for some time, in order ofbattle, before the mouth of the harbour. Having thus extorted from theenemy a full confession of their being defeated, and having sent homethe Rhodians and Eumenes, the Romans steered their course to Chios.When they had passed Phaenicus, a port of Erythraea, they cast anchorfor the night; and proceeding next day to the island, came up to thecity itself. After halting here a few days for the purpose chieflyof refreshing the rowers, they sailed over to Phocaea. Here theyleft four quinque remes for the defence of the city, and proceeded toCannae, where, as the winter now approached, the ships were hauled onshore, and surrounded with a trench and rampart. At the close of theyear, the elections were held at Rome, in which were chosen consuls,Lucius Cornelius Scipio and Caius Laelius, from whom all men expectedthe conclusion of the war with Antiochus. Next day were electedpraetors, Marcus Tuccius, Lucius Aurunculeius, Cneius Fulvius, LuciusAemilius, Publius Junius, and Caius Atinius Labeo."
